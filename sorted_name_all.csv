All,It's the most wonderful time in Pawnee
Allison,I laid out some preliminary plans in this binder.
Allison,They were.
Allison,"Madame Ambassador, are you changing the scenario?"
Allison,You guys know each other?
Allison,I had to order them through some Mexican back channels.
Allison,"They did, but they opened up a new one in Oaxaca."
Allison,"What? Oh, my God!"
Allison,"My name is Cassidy, and I'm really annoyed with you."
Allison,"The theater department did Into the Woods last year, and we still have the scenery."
Allison,"I was thinking the theme could be ""Fairy tale."""
Allison,Yes!
Allison,What?
Allison,We're so excited to see a true Pawnee Model UN legend in action.
Allison,Thanks a lot.
Allison,Thank you so much for coming and trying to help save our club.
Allison,Of course you are.
Allison,I'm not finished.
Allison,"Oh, what am I talking about?"
Allison,Are you Leslie Knope?
Allison,Excuse me.
Allison,"Oh, that's really good."
Allison,We didn't prepare for this.
Allison,We've been making great strides with genetically modified crops and would gladly pledge to continue the growth of--
Allison,I definitely need money for school.
Allison,Definitely!
Allison,Look around.
Allison,I have to say I admire you both.
Allison,"You were right, Leslie."
Allison,"Watching all those happy faces, it felt amazing."
Allison,'Cause you guys suck.
Allison,Why are you showing me all this?
Allison,But it was really nice to build something and get paid for it.
Allison,I don't know what I'm doing this summer.
Allison,"Leslie, I told you."
Allison,"Uh, ermâ¦"
Allison,We thought you were gonna teach us how to solve problems.
Allison,"Thanks, Leslie, for this, and for making prom happen in the first place."
Allison,"Yeah, sure."
Allison,"Ms. Knope, it'd be my honor."
Allison,I can't believe he gave you an Aplus.
Allison,That would be awesome.
Allison,"Um, Leslie was just telling me about your summer internship, and I was thinking about taking it."
Allison,The Security Council has decided to expel Peru and Denmark from the United Nations.
Allison,Attention!
Allison,"Hi, Mr. Swanson."
Allison,"Oh, let me introduce you to my boyfriend."
Allison,I'm totally interested.
Allison,So just pull the rope?
Allison,You've ruined my favorite club.
Alyssa,"Two days later, we had set up the entire program, and she sent me a throw pillow with my face stitched onto it."
Alyssa,"Oh, I'm very familiar with Leslie's enthusiasm."
Andrew Luck,You guys are weird.
Andrew Luck,See ya!
Andrew Luck,How are you?
Andrew Luck,Right.
Andrew Luck,"Oh, yeah."
Andrew Luck,"Yeah, let's do it."
Andrew Luck,I'll try.
Andrew Luck,"We're gonna have some fun tonight, Pawnee!"
Andrew Luck,"Okay, guy, settle down."
Andy Dwyer,What the hell?
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, did I interrupt?"
Andy Dwyer,What are you guys talking about?
Andy Dwyer,"I think it could have been, honest to God."
Andy Dwyer,And you imagine he's wearing a cape while he's plowing her?
Andy Dwyer,"No, just, Captain Mustache?"
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, if all you can think of is Ron, you know... Maybe put him in some tights and a cape, and then it would be funny."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check this out."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, spell your last name for me."
Andy Dwyer,Real quick.
Andy Dwyer,"I am on hold with the State Parks Department I am on hold, so suck on my butt."
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,It's Mailman Barry.
Andy Dwyer,"Morning, Barry."
Andy Dwyer,I have something for you.
Andy Dwyer,Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,Ninjas attack!
Andy Dwyer,Hold on.
Andy Dwyer,Put the files in the drawer.
Andy Dwyer,That's broken.
Andy Dwyer,Believe in me!
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Hit me.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Did you see that?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's a plastic bag."
Andy Dwyer,I believe we're covered.
Andy Dwyer,Is that a goose that just flew by the window?
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.
Andy Dwyer,We got it wrong.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why?"
Andy Dwyer,Kraft?
Andy Dwyer,The universe?
Andy Dwyer,"Sausage, onion, and peppers."
Andy Dwyer,Scientifically proven to be the best toppings.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, right on."
Andy Dwyer,Say it again.
Andy Dwyer,"It's ""alumilum."""
Andy Dwyer,Tom's ex-wife.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Alumilum!
Andy Dwyer,Me neither.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"I work there part time, and I have my own TV show."
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, do you do you have it here?"
Andy Dwyer,"If I may, ours is great."
Andy Dwyer,"On one condition: I want you to stay here in London with me for no more than three months, to help me get it up and running and tell me what to do."
Andy Dwyer,Say it again.
Andy Dwyer,You set this whole thing up so I would be unmad at you.
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I can't do it, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,That's cool.
Andy Dwyer,I don't even know what I would be doing.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, besides, this is England."
Andy Dwyer,Everything is so weird.
Andy Dwyer,It's all different.
Andy Dwyer,Do they?
Andy Dwyer,I'll be damned.
Andy Dwyer,We have the insurance thing.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, like that."
Andy Dwyer,That's what I'm exactly what I'm talking about.
Andy Dwyer,Or like the Piccadilly Circus we went to?
Andy Dwyer,Not even a circus.
Andy Dwyer,"There's no elephants, there was no cotton candy, there's no clowns."
Andy Dwyer,One bearded lady.
Andy Dwyer,I can do this.
Andy Dwyer,She got all rude when I marveled at her.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, he's awesome."
Andy Dwyer,He's everything you would want in a boss.
Andy Dwyer,Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,This case just remained interesting.
Andy Dwyer,"This is a picture oh, this is us making out I don't know where that is, but you can tell that she's sucking on my lip."
Andy Dwyer,At the Neutral Milk Hotel.
Andy Dwyer,Here's a picture of us making out in Ben's office.
Andy Dwyer,Here's a picture of me and April making out in her apartment.
Andy Dwyer,"They didn't answer, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,Where is everyone?
Andy Dwyer,Hunting trip?
Andy Dwyer,Did Mark go?
Andy Dwyer,"That's cool, at least he's not with Ann."
Andy Dwyer,God!
Andy Dwyer,How come he gets to do all the things I wanna do?
Andy Dwyer,"Go hunting, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,That would be really awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"But I don't think that will happen, probably."
Andy Dwyer,I kinda was.
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, boss."
Andy Dwyer,Why are we laughing?
Andy Dwyer,Forget it.
Andy Dwyer,Ann and Mark!
Andy Dwyer,Three more kicks apiece.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,"And art is supposed to be happy and fun, and everyone knows that."
Andy Dwyer,"'Cause their music is sad, and depressing, and weird."
Andy Dwyer,'Cause it's starting to not feel that way.
Andy Dwyer,Do you even think Mouse Rat is the greatest band in the world?
Andy Dwyer,You like some other dude's band more than me.
Andy Dwyer,"No, you get over it."
Andy Dwyer,It's Ann and Mark!
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I'm out of milk."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Just what do I do with this?
Andy Dwyer,"But, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that sucks."
Andy Dwyer,Out of the way!
Andy Dwyer,Dine and dash.
Andy Dwyer,You sure?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,He was a really good bassist.
Andy Dwyer,I was actually starting to like him.
Andy Dwyer,Good time.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, because, you know what Let's go!"
Andy Dwyer,I can do one.
Andy Dwyer,Let's see here.
Andy Dwyer,"It's not very good, but I think I could pull it off."
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,I just feel like he's gonna get upset when he finds out that we're American.
Andy Dwyer,"Ugh, great."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, well, I guess we'll take the meeting anyway."
Andy Dwyer,"After all, we did come all the way down under."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank God."
Andy Dwyer,I knew that other name must have been a stupid joke.
Andy Dwyer,That is really hot.
Andy Dwyer,How come you don't dress up like that for me?
Andy Dwyer,Everything is going great.
Andy Dwyer,That's what I was trying to say.
Andy Dwyer,"Real quick, should I do a British accent?"
Andy Dwyer,Is Eduardo coming?
Andy Dwyer,She said she thought it was an animal--
Andy Dwyer,"Honestly, you'd look hot naked."
Andy Dwyer,'Cause she is super hot.
Andy Dwyer,That is hot.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, she has, every single time."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, you look super hot."
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Andy Dwyer,"Other day, other day... Yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yesterday?"
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,Nice and band totally worked.
Andy Dwyer,"Eh, that's a good thing, babe."
Andy Dwyer,They want to talk to you because you're important to them.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm okay-- You know, I'd be okay if we... I'd be okay if we never mentioned it again."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I lost 50 pounds in one month."
Andy Dwyer,"The moan, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"I know, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Slow cooker!
Andy Dwyer,Probably too much.
Andy Dwyer,The weird moan you made.
Andy Dwyer,That was super weird.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Do you not remember that? I talked about it with the lady who went after you for a half an hour.
Andy Dwyer,Look what she gave us.
Andy Dwyer,April's kicking ass at her National Parks job.
Andy Dwyer,"I know you do, sweetheart."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, uh, by the way, I think that Chris is lonely, so I told him he could borrow Champion whenever."
Andy Dwyer,What else does your family own?
Andy Dwyer,That's exactly how they'll be expecting me to try to break in.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,We got to find a way to break in there.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, you know what I want?"
Andy Dwyer,Ice cream.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you guys have that here, ice cream?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's so good."
Andy Dwyer,You have to get it.
Andy Dwyer,"It's, like, scoops, and it comes on a cone."
Andy Dwyer,"I couldn't tell, 'cause you had that mask thing over your eyes."
Andy Dwyer,"So, like, you your family owns all this stuff?"
Andy Dwyer,"You weren't trying to sleep, were you?"
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, Alcatraz."
Andy Dwyer,Do you have that here?
Andy Dwyer,Goodbye.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Wait.
Andy Dwyer,You have it?
Andy Dwyer,That'd be awesome if we were.
Andy Dwyer,Can we get some?
Andy Dwyer,Could we do could we have some?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, guess what, ain't gonna work."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Can't believe Michael Bay spent a billion dollars of his own money to build that for The Rock.
Andy Dwyer,Here you go.
Andy Dwyer,I think I broke mine!
Andy Dwyer,Ohh!
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm like, ""What?"""
Andy Dwyer,Aww.
Andy Dwyer,Piggyback!
Andy Dwyer,Piggyback!
Andy Dwyer,Move!
Andy Dwyer,Piggyback!
Andy Dwyer,Bam!
Andy Dwyer,Piggyback!
Andy Dwyer,Bam!
Andy Dwyer,Mark!
Andy Dwyer,Brendanawicz!
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, awesome."
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,Are those remote control helicopters?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, would I?"
Andy Dwyer,I call blue one!
Andy Dwyer,"What are you talking about, dude?"
Andy Dwyer,I called it.
Andy Dwyer,That's the rule.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Aah!
Andy Dwyer,Are those I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, remote control helicopters, talks funny."
Andy Dwyer,Total package.
Andy Dwyer,Who is she dating?
Andy Dwyer,"If the Bread and Breakfast, you sleep there and you get breakfast."
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember saying anything about anyone being pregnant.
Andy Dwyer,Neutral Milk Hotel.
Andy Dwyer,Interesting.
Andy Dwyer,Official police wrist lock.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Who is Jeff Mangum?
Andy Dwyer,Yay!
Andy Dwyer,Me!
Andy Dwyer,"Um, this is almost too easy."
Andy Dwyer,You're kickass Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,You wanna do Toots?
Andy Dwyer,What song should we do?
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, they wantthe kids want an encore, I'm sorry."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,They need an encore.
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Tom has something wrong with his butt.
Andy Dwyer,You can't hit me.
Andy Dwyer,"Long distance relationships are never easy, but you never, ever give up on stuff."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I think you're wrong."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, uh, Benjamin, how fancy is this party tonight?"
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, is this, like, a shorts or a pants kind of gala?"
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember.
Andy Dwyer,I'm incredible.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,Probably making out on top of a deer carcass.
Andy Dwyer,Super romantic.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I did it! I kept a secret."
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I think that would... That's pretty gross."
Andy Dwyer,Seems kind of weird.
Andy Dwyer,"When you put it that way, it doesn't sound that weird at all."
Andy Dwyer,They're here-- don't try to get it out of me anymore.
Andy Dwyer,Really? All right.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna tell you 'cause it's super juicy-- you ready?
Andy Dwyer,Leslie is a spy.
Andy Dwyer,You're more important than anything.
Andy Dwyer,"It's just that it's a really big secret, and for once, I wanted to keep my word."
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna go sterilize my neck.
Andy Dwyer,"Damn, really?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Point is, you're better than Hot Rebecca."
Andy Dwyer,It was really expensive.
Andy Dwyer,Why wouldn't you pick me?
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,But screw it.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Do you really want to know?
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, fine."
Andy Dwyer,Likewise.
Andy Dwyer,"How many people am I talking to, Donna?"
Andy Dwyer,Try to hit me.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I guess I'll see you guys around."
Andy Dwyer,"Or here, no, try, it's this hand."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, also, Mark, again, we don't have those extra small condoms you ordered."
Andy Dwyer,"I called the factory, it's gonna take a special order."
Andy Dwyer,"Not just because of the size, but because of the weird shape as well."
Andy Dwyer,I've got the free medicine card.
Andy Dwyer,Something they've never dealt with before.
Andy Dwyer,Are you in this office purely for business reasons?
Andy Dwyer,We'll talk.
Andy Dwyer,I made that up.
Andy Dwyer,"Every day, I subtly chip away at their relationship."
Andy Dwyer,"Weakening it, little by little."
Andy Dwyer,Are you guys-- Are you guys hanging out together?
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,God.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry that took forever.
Andy Dwyer,Here you go.
Andy Dwyer,That's what makes you
Andy Dwyer,"Mark never asked me for any small, weirdly shaped condoms."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm not saying we're the best band in the universe, but we are, I would say, honestly, the best band in the world."
Andy Dwyer,What a coincidence!
Andy Dwyer,The shoeshine stand still doesn't have that syphilis medication you were asking about.
Andy Dwyer,Have you guys seen Ultimate Battle Smoothie?
Andy Dwyer,They're moving again to Chinatown in France.
Andy Dwyer,I love Slurp HD.
Andy Dwyer,Chris and Ann are moving.
Andy Dwyer,I'm dying.
Andy Dwyer,That Ralph Macchio guy is a total douche.
Andy Dwyer,They're both dying.
Andy Dwyer,I guess I'm super bad at picking up signals.
Andy Dwyer,Leslie is dying.
Andy Dwyer,Ben is dyingâ¦ he has the same disease Larry has.
Andy Dwyer,I thought she liked me.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,Ben's dog is dying.
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,You can have my Remy Martin for your birthday.
Andy Dwyer,One or 1 1/9?
Andy Dwyer,Probably good.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,It's the dusty one.
Andy Dwyer,"Technically, we're all dying, unless you choose the right grail."
Andy Dwyer,We ended up with more animals than we started with.
Andy Dwyer,I can hear you.
Andy Dwyer,I can hear you.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,I'll tell you the secret.
Andy Dwyer,Just trust me.
Andy Dwyer,"Everything's going to be fine with you and Ben, because if I know Ben, he, too, is an amalgam."
Andy Dwyer,Could we just real quick stop at the nearest place that has free pants?
Andy Dwyer,High!
Andy Dwyer,Sugar high!
Andy Dwyer,Sugar hit high!
Andy Dwyer,Sugar high!
Andy Dwyer,Instant sugar high!
Andy Dwyer,Not in this one.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God!"
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,"All I've had is fruits and vegetables, for weeks now."
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, all right."
Andy Dwyer,"Making out are you okay, boss?"
Andy Dwyer,"Boss, I need your Herbie Hancock on this."
Andy Dwyer,Is that candy?
Andy Dwyer,How's she doing?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I miss her so much, it's ridiculous."
Andy Dwyer,She's doing good?
Andy Dwyer,So how's Ann?
Andy Dwyer,"Man, oh, man."
Andy Dwyer,It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Andy Dwyer,"Back to you, Professor."
Andy Dwyer,"I thought I thought maybe it was when I was I, uh I'll get 'em next time."
Andy Dwyer,That will be progress.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Sugar slam!
Andy Dwyer,Mmmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.
Andy Dwyer,I mean
Andy Dwyer,Is she?
Andy Dwyer,You just said Ann might be dating somebody else.
Andy Dwyer,He said he wanted me to head up the company.
Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin is on the case.
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea how to run a nonprofit.
Andy Dwyer,Traveling.
Andy Dwyer,Is she dating somebody else?
Andy Dwyer,Is she?
Andy Dwyer,Seems like the only logical solution.
Andy Dwyer,"That way, if she wants me back, I can be at her house, like, in two seconds, before she changes her mind."
Andy Dwyer,We don't rest until we get that.
Andy Dwyer,I just like being nearby.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,I did it!
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,It was pretty interesting to begin with.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, not just."
Andy Dwyer,Marco!
Andy Dwyer,Marco!
Andy Dwyer,Marco?
Andy Dwyer,Marco!
Andy Dwyer,We're good.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I am always careful."
Andy Dwyer,I got it out.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, this isn't right."
Andy Dwyer,None of this looks familiar.
Andy Dwyer,Eddie?
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,He's like 20 minutes late.
Andy Dwyer,I was supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, this is my dear friend, Mark Brendanawicz."
Andy Dwyer,We're good to go.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'm older than that."
Andy Dwyer,"Mark! Brendanawicz, hey. What's 25 divided by 2 plus 7?"
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, how old are you?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah? Do you have a tab I could put it on?
Andy Dwyer,I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Andy Dwyer,And howâ¦
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, wait here."
Andy Dwyer,There's weed down there?
Andy Dwyer,Whew.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, don't look at me."
Andy Dwyer,"Fruits and vegetables, so I'm getting a lot of vitamins"
Andy Dwyer,Somebody just planted a garden down there.
Andy Dwyer,It's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"For now, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,What happened?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, okay. Hey, can I buy you a drink?"
Andy Dwyer,It's so good to see you.
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing here?
Andy Dwyer,I don't even know what a bureaucrat is.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, you guys."
Andy Dwyer,A fact about me.
Andy Dwyer,I've lived in Pawnee my whole life.
Andy Dwyer,"They're gonna do it in a right, kind of legal way that empowers prostitution."
Andy Dwyer,Who's Hot Rebecca?
Andy Dwyer,"I'll flirt with you, write my name on a napkin."
Andy Dwyer,Tip money and stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"Then-- maybe that's all you see, but at least you can give me extra money."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, maybe I'm only sexy."
Andy Dwyer,"We need to start teaching women football, teaching women U.F.C. , teaching them to drive trucks without crashing."
Andy Dwyer,"No, I don't think we can accept donations over 50 dollars."
Andy Dwyer,And my computer.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, crap, I forgot my books."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, duh! Yeah, you guys totally slept together."
Andy Dwyer,That is a fact.
Andy Dwyer,Ah.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Give me another one.
Andy Dwyer,You do one.
Andy Dwyer,What do you mean the squirrel took the nuts out of the... Out of that kid's backpack and ate them?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,This case just got interesting.
Andy Dwyer,As ready as I'll ever be.
Andy Dwyer,I won't.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Not a question.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,How was that? That wasn't good?
Andy Dwyer,You got your camera ready?
Andy Dwyer,And here we go.
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Andy Dwyer,School.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, my name is Andy Dwyer, and I would be a perfect contestant for Deal or No Deal."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it!
Andy Dwyer,It is!
Andy Dwyer,You're so good at reminding me where pizza is.
Andy Dwyer,You came back to my voice.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, babe."
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Andy Dwyer,Gases fill the volume of whatever container they're in.
Andy Dwyer,"But, babe, pizza."
Andy Dwyer,"No, April, we would all die."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyways, what do you say I take you over to the ball pit, and we find your cell phone I lost?"
Andy Dwyer,They never tell you when you go solo that it's just gonna be you up there.
Andy Dwyer,I guess I just kind of miss having people up onstage with me.
Andy Dwyer,She's married to me.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that's why I do what I do."
Andy Dwyer,I gave a kid pee pants?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, see you."
Andy Dwyer,"That was how I saw it, but--"
Andy Dwyer,"I end up beating the computer finally, and then the band just sort of drifts apart."
Andy Dwyer,Super cool to hear Sister Christian that many times in a row.
Andy Dwyer,Now is the moment we've all been waiting for.
Andy Dwyer,"This next band agreed to reunite for one night only, and it's gonna be great."
Andy Dwyer,I personally hope that they play Summer Sun.
Andy Dwyer,"That sounds like an amazing day, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, we are burning this awful pantsuit."
Andy Dwyer,I wanted to bone her right there in that dirty church basement.
Andy Dwyer,"So smart, so hot, so mean."
Andy Dwyer,She was awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you should have seen her, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Somebody forgot to pay the cable bill.
Andy Dwyer,Uhoh.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, thanks."
Andy Dwyer,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Duke Silver!"
Andy Dwyer,"Bye, Ethel!"
Andy Dwyer,I'd get really good at chess.
Andy Dwyer,"""Remind Tom Ask Something."""
Andy Dwyer,"You got it, boss."
Andy Dwyer,And we're gonna close tonight out with a tribute to Pawnee's greatest treasure.
Andy Dwyer,"I love this town so much, and I'm just so proud to live here."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, how about this Unity concert, huh, Pawnee?"
Andy Dwyer,"No, I mean, I love that I'm Johnny Karate now, but being part of a band, that's just-- that's rock and roll, man."
Andy Dwyer,"Without any further ado, land ho!"
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, good point."
Andy Dwyer,A different ambulance than the one I ran into.
Andy Dwyer,Summer sun summer sun
Andy Dwyer,"We all know how it goes, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing You trade your legs for angel's wings and once we've all said goodbye you take a running leap, and you learn to fly bye bye, Li'l Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Whoo!"
Andy Dwyer,And then I'd go to the hospital.
Andy Dwyer,"Crowd starts chanting my name, and I give 'em the thumbsup."
Andy Dwyer,"And then in the first game, of course, I'd break my leg."
Andy Dwyer,Beat it.
Andy Dwyer,I recently invested in some shirts I got at a garage sale.
Andy Dwyer,This is Ron Swanson we're talking about.
Andy Dwyer,We like to dabble.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I am so sorry."
Andy Dwyer,Imaginary friends are cool imaginary friends take the fall for you
Andy Dwyer,I'm Johnny Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Do you have a key in your shoe?
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,"You got it, babe."
Andy Dwyer,And I always liked you.
Andy Dwyer,That was neat.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah! My wife is pregnant!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, hey."
Andy Dwyer,You want those shoes shined?
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, buddy, you came back."
Andy Dwyer,I've been hearing a lot of people say that a lot about a lot of stuff.
Andy Dwyer,We are all finished.
Andy Dwyer,No sweat.
Andy Dwyer,It is definitely due to the economy.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Am I right?
Andy Dwyer,Left those at Wendy's on the way home.
Andy Dwyer,"It's only 5 bucks, and I'll let you cut in front of this guy."
Andy Dwyer,"I always figured we'd you know, whatever break up 'cause I got drafted by the Colts."
Andy Dwyer,Not for long.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I do know."
Andy Dwyer,I think you can do this just being yourself.
Andy Dwyer,I'll give you a discount because you're a friend of Ann's.
Andy Dwyer,"Good to see you, bud."
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, hey, Jack."
Andy Dwyer,Plus you're the smartest person on the planet.
Andy Dwyer,"You, my friend, are ready to go dancing."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"How you doing, man?"
Andy Dwyer,So The economy.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, burly."
Andy Dwyer,Remember karate on bad guys only.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, thanks, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Everybody go crazy!
Andy Dwyer,Thank you!
Andy Dwyer,Next?
Andy Dwyer,"Look, you look amazing in this outfit."
Andy Dwyer,I guess I must have screwed up.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, how about you?"
Andy Dwyer,Need a little dog waxing?
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Next?
Andy Dwyer,My assistant has something she'd like to show you.
Andy Dwyer,The teeny one?
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Wall Street."
Andy Dwyer,I get my own office phone.
Andy Dwyer,Double computers?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, wow!"
Andy Dwyer,You're so smart.
Andy Dwyer,What's your name?
Andy Dwyer,"Nice to meet you, ma'am."
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know what it is you do, but you seem important enough to get that done."
Andy Dwyer,"Also, can you bring back Power Rangers?"
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, did his leg grow back?"
Andy Dwyer,"I wasn't super paying attention to what you just said that we'll be doing, but I will give 110 percent. Well, as soon as you repeat yourself in a more interesting way."
Andy Dwyer,Chris!
Andy Dwyer,I love it.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Baby, you are so creepy."
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I also got this dude's briefcase.
Andy Dwyer,It was just laying there.
Andy Dwyer,Kind of a panic move.
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, that's so sweet."
Andy Dwyer,Buy more stocks.
Andy Dwyer,Now.
Andy Dwyer,This phone kind of smells like a butt.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,I found it outside of Ron's cabin after our brainstorming session.
Andy Dwyer,Is there any possibility MonaLisa could be pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, first, I would be like, ""Dad You're alive?"""
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Andy Dwyer,Mmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"To make that dream come true for another kid Well, that's what being a cop is all about."
Andy Dwyer,"When I was a kid, I always wanted to hold a cop's gun."
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I give it to him."
Andy Dwyer,That's okay.
Andy Dwyer,"It's a positive pregnancy test, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,I worked really hard.
Andy Dwyer,"I forgot, Ben how many bags of marshmallows do I give them?"
Andy Dwyer,That song is about April.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Wait.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, everyone calls me Andy, but my full name is Andrew, I think, so No?"
Andy Dwyer,"November, your bangs are cute, November, your voice is a flute, November, let's pretend the sky is for us, Let's spread our wings and fly on a date, I want to go on a date with you, November."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know how to answer that.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my assistant has something she'd like to show you, partner."
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I made a shrimp claw."
Andy Dwyer,"November, you're beautiful, November, you're so serene, walk among the clouds, and see that you and me, were meant to be,"
Andy Dwyer,I love politics.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Let's go, munchkins."
Andy Dwyer,I did every pair that I could.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I'm nervous."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't know what to do with these.
Andy Dwyer,Let's get divorced.
Andy Dwyer,I wish I could marry you all over again.
Andy Dwyer,You're the greatest wife ever.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, thank you so much for organizing the mouse rat reunion."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I doubt it.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I think you're a cool dude, too."
Andy Dwyer,I like you as well.
Andy Dwyer,But I'm still in love with Ann.
Andy Dwyer,I couldn't have been more upfront about that.
Andy Dwyer,"Andy, Ann, I thought it had a nice ring to it."
Andy Dwyer,"That way, we can get married again."
Andy Dwyer,April?
Andy Dwyer,"Besides, the math doesn't add up because we only have sex every single day."
Andy Dwyer,"And since she's the only one that we haven't talked to, it has to be hers."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I still have feelings for you."
Andy Dwyer,I'm in a band.
Andy Dwyer,Okay? I said it.
Andy Dwyer,"There's so much free food at this party, honey."
Andy Dwyer,What do you want me to do? Not mention those feelings to your boyfriend?
Andy Dwyer,What? Fine.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna.
Andy Dwyer,That's it.
Andy Dwyer,"No, she would've told me."
Andy Dwyer,It was me.
Andy Dwyer,You want to?
Andy Dwyer,We're getting divorced!
Andy Dwyer,I think they're gloves.
Andy Dwyer,I picture 533 salt shakers and batteries lighting a building on fire.
Andy Dwyer,You know how I remember that?
Andy Dwyer,Arson is 533.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, that is the coolest sentence I've ever heard somebody talk."
Andy Dwyer,You got all of that from a picture?
Andy Dwyer,"The way I remember that, I picture 35 a salt shakers and 42 batteries."
Andy Dwyer,Assault and battery.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, quiz me."
Andy Dwyer,"First, we do the written exam, and then we do the personality evaluation, which I feel like I'm gonna nail, 'cause people always say, ""But he's got a great personality."""
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know who should wear these shoes?"
Andy Dwyer,"We should do that, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Monkeys.
Andy Dwyer,Who wouldn't?
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Donna.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm on a break, one of the many advantages of owning your own business."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, Donna."
Andy Dwyer,Ann is trying to decide between Mark and myself.
Andy Dwyer,"If you had to choose, who would you choose?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm nice.
Andy Dwyer,"Right now, on the spot."
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,Mark.
Andy Dwyer,"Also, do you know where my catcher's mitt is?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you can't keep it from me."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,And I love her.
Andy Dwyer,"Maybe April doesn't think that we're the greatest band in the world, but, man, she loves me."
Andy Dwyer,You bought it back from Sewage Joe?
Andy Dwyer,Crazy.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,That's my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,What is this?
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.
Andy Dwyer,and I had to fight a squirrel.
Andy Dwyer,"Found you, oh I found you."
Andy Dwyer,An amalgam.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, I love this song."
Andy Dwyer,"Sleeping in a tent, I'm sleeping in the tent."
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,Ann.
Andy Dwyer,I won't look up your skirt.
Andy Dwyer,Third time today.
Andy Dwyer,What the [bleep] man?
Andy Dwyer,I hope he wasn't a handful.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you so much.
Andy Dwyer,I missed you.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, bud."
Andy Dwyer,I'm on top of the world.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,"That means ""thank you""?"
Andy Dwyer,"We're amazing, so let me know how much you like us."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, mine doesn't have any pictures."
Andy Dwyer,What are you listening to?
Andy Dwyer,April's making you listen to that?
Andy Dwyer,If you think if you do you think it would help?
Andy Dwyer,That would be so hot.
Andy Dwyer,She's really into that indie stuff.
Andy Dwyer,It's Andy.
Andy Dwyer,It's me.
Andy Dwyer,I'm more of a Dave Matthews guy myself.
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,I love that song.
Andy Dwyer,Sweet!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, yes."
Andy Dwyer,And we kind of have a long backstory of history.
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, here."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, honestly, because there's already a girl that I like."
Andy Dwyer,But I don't think we should go out romantically.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Shauna, look, I think you are a super cute person, and your newspaper articles are so cool, and they're probably very accurate."
Andy Dwyer,We've got another forum today.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,Just now? Nothing.
Andy Dwyer,Take one.
Andy Dwyer,"So, you know, who cares."
Andy Dwyer,Check us out.
Andy Dwyer,Let's just hop back in that saddle.
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,"That's mine, it's all mine."
Andy Dwyer,This whole company is ours.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,I call it.
Andy Dwyer,"It totally works, but I got spaghetti in the keyboard."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna bring it back.
Andy Dwyer,I forgot.
Andy Dwyer,"I took it home, and I spaced."
Andy Dwyer,New band name.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't mean to steal it.
Andy Dwyer,Fleetwood Mac Sex Pants.
Andy Dwyer,It's totally broken!
Andy Dwyer,Guys!
Andy Dwyer,Maybe just Fleetwood Mac.
Andy Dwyer,Is this about the laptop?
Andy Dwyer,Whoohoohoo!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,"What no, he won't 'cause I've been trying it, and it didn't work."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I just dropped off Leslie's triplets with her mom."
Andy Dwyer,All three of 'em.
Andy Dwyer,I can't believe we're at Hogwarts!
Andy Dwyer,San Francisco's the best.
Andy Dwyer,Oh-ho!
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I knew it'd go down, but not that fast!"
Andy Dwyer,Look at it go!
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,You like music?
Andy Dwyer,"You don't remember anything that happened last night, do you?"
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, man, we did it."
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I can't believe our house is going to be full of rich people named Dottie and Todd and Rick."
Andy Dwyer,You should see the booger under this chair.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine?
Andy Dwyer,Oh [bleep].
Andy Dwyer,This is going to be so fun letting you dangle until I finally reveal that we did not make out.
Andy Dwyer,"I got two microphones, a four-track recorder and every bass tab to Dave Matthews ever."
Andy Dwyer,"We're gonna jam for, like, nine hours."
Andy Dwyer,Is that cool?
Andy Dwyer,Objection.
Andy Dwyer,Ma'am?
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say, sir?"
Andy Dwyer,That's really dangerous.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,"The key is, you have to throw the dirt into the back of the fan."
Andy Dwyer,Are they throwing dirt into a fan?
Andy Dwyer,Are they playing any games I invented?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you invented that game."
Andy Dwyer,"Shine, shine, shine your shoes."
Andy Dwyer,"And then after they give us the free wifi, we tell 'em that the treasure was love all along."
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, we could tell 'em that there's buried treasure in Pawnee."
Andy Dwyer,"For once, it's Ann who blacked out drunk and not Andy."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"I found the pregnancy test, honey."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, if you think it'd help you."
Andy Dwyer,Andâ¦ I like her.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Of course.
Andy Dwyer,You're pregnant.
Andy Dwyer,Unity concert!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it's about that time."
Andy Dwyer,It kind of does.
Andy Dwyer,"Or, actually, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,It doesn't even look like you.
Andy Dwyer,It's not that great.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, don't cry."
Andy Dwyer,No! We just ruled that out.
Andy Dwyer,Was that Brandi Maxxxx?
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, dang it."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll get out of your hair."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"You did? That's amazing! Wait, why did you wait to tell me?"
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you think sewing kits are covered by insurance? Or groceries or, like, Xbox games? What is insurance?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we could get through that."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, look."
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"It would suck for a while, and I would miss you while you're gone."
Andy Dwyer,You could sew up my lip underneath a bridge somewhere.
Andy Dwyer,We could buy a sewing kit.
Andy Dwyer,Let's just go home and care for each other.
Andy Dwyer,Every time.
Andy Dwyer,You want to know what else isn't good business?
Andy Dwyer,That guy's my friend.
Andy Dwyer,No more doctors.
Andy Dwyer,They're a bunch of scam artists.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"But this will do. I have some champagne, and I had to drink most of it to survive, so I'm kind of buzzed right now."
Andy Dwyer,"Champion, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, business is a little slow."
Andy Dwyer,You look ravishing.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry Kyle.
Andy Dwyer,Here.
Andy Dwyer,"But as I've known about you for the past 20 seconds, this is your dream."
Andy Dwyer,Enough technical business talk.
Andy Dwyer,Give me this.
Andy Dwyer,"I feel naked without it, okay."
Andy Dwyer,Next.
Andy Dwyer,Except it was way nicer there.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm taking you camping. This is what I had set up at the other camp site."
Andy Dwyer,They reel you in with the free stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, are you sure you're not?"
Andy Dwyer,"Told you I was gonna take you camping, didn't I?"
Andy Dwyer,"Racing the rats, trying to get the cheese."
Andy Dwyer,I usually
Andy Dwyer,"Next thing you know, bam, you run into an ambulance."
Andy Dwyer,"Champion, you're lost and soon you'll be found I rescued you from the pound, something somethingoh manon the ground get on out of here Champion!"
Andy Dwyer,Chasing the cheese.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,"I never understood the term ""elbow grease."""
Andy Dwyer,Who the hell is pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,I found a pregnancy test at your cabin and I checked with all the girls over there and wasn't any of them.
Andy Dwyer,I got the greatest wife in the world!
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun."
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"So, Ann, how you been?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, call an ambulance!"
Andy Dwyer,"The slots are finalized, but I can squeeze in ten minutes if a certain mister Duke Silver wanted to come out."
Andy Dwyer,"Last chance, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Do you need your money back, Ron?"
Andy Dwyer,Because I already spent it.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, I forgot!"
Andy Dwyer,I feel right at home as a shoe shiner.
Andy Dwyer,You and me?
Andy Dwyer,Eduardo.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Eduardo."
Andy Dwyer,I want to apologize.
Andy Dwyer,Just because you're dating my soul mate doesn't give me any right to be a jerk to you.
Andy Dwyer,"I promise from now on, I'm just gonna be super nice to you."
Andy Dwyer,You're welcome.
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,My band.
Andy Dwyer,It's our latest album.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know I'm doing it really, really well."
Andy Dwyer,"Are you sure, boss?"
Andy Dwyer,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accept the following missions."
Andy Dwyer,Donna.
Andy Dwyer,Did you or did you not leave this positive pregnancy test in a dumpster in the woods?
Andy Dwyer,That's great!
Andy Dwyer,I guess it's not really grease.
Andy Dwyer,Good for you!
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, are you pregnant?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, we made a good call on that one."
Andy Dwyer,Are you sure everything will be all right if April goes to vet school?
Andy Dwyer,Just hard work.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, thank you."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I just joined the rat race."
Andy Dwyer,I don't have my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,Madison.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, I forgot."
Andy Dwyer,Who the hell is pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,"Everybody, let's get to work."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go."
Andy Dwyer,"I found a pregnancy test at your cabin, and I checked with all the girls over there."
Andy Dwyer,It wasn't any of them.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Nice, shiny shoes you got there."
Andy Dwyer,And all of the rest of the volunteer work assignments are up on this board.
Andy Dwyer,We're married! We're totally gonna do it later!
Andy Dwyer,Larry.
Andy Dwyer,"Change is good, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,Step two has been completed easily.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, all the time."
Andy Dwyer,I would feel bad about myself because I would start to think about this perfect guy.
Andy Dwyer,"Anytime you would talk about Justin, I didn't feel very important."
Andy Dwyer,That was rough.
Andy Dwyer,"Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have left."
Andy Dwyer,"But you do know now, so you have to choose."
Andy Dwyer,It's either me or Justin.
Andy Dwyer,"Are you, though?"
Andy Dwyer,Ah! That close.
Andy Dwyer,Got you a birthday present.
Andy Dwyer,Nice.
Andy Dwyer,"I got to admit, I thought your costume would maybe be a little bit sluttier."
Andy Dwyer,Now I work alone.
Andy Dwyer,Stealing the President's rubies.
Andy Dwyer,Classic.
Andy Dwyer,I was the best damn agent they had until I was framed for a crime I didn't commit.
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, birthday girl."
Andy Dwyer,"Get out, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank God."
Andy Dwyer,I'd love to hear all about your family vacation.
Andy Dwyer,Who are you?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's great."
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Andy Dwyer,Not bad for a guy with two broken legs.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Every time I used to sit around all afternoon playing video games wearing only my slippers, all of a sudden, I would start to feel bad about myself, and do you know why?"
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"Actually, I do know what I'm talking about."
Andy Dwyer,What you're doing to Mark is not cool.
Andy Dwyer,It's named after a month out of the year.
Andy Dwyer,But I'll give you a clue.
Andy Dwyer,Not telling.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I wrote you a song.
Andy Dwyer,I got you something else.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,That's my wife.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, well, well. Look who's bothering who now?"
Andy Dwyer,Seems like the shot is on the other foot.
Andy Dwyer,And the guuy who polishes shoes is now me.
Andy Dwyer,What up? What can I do for ya?
Andy Dwyer,That wasn't it.
Andy Dwyer,That's all I have to hear.
Andy Dwyer,You won't live to regret this.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Justin?"
Andy Dwyer,I hate Justin.
Andy Dwyer,Ann was so obviously into him.
Andy Dwyer,It was so annoying.
Andy Dwyer,Just kidding.
Andy Dwyer,"I would say, in terms of guys that she's in love with, Justin's up here, I'm up here, and then you're down here."
Andy Dwyer,That high five was your birthday present.
Andy Dwyer,Did you like that?
Andy Dwyer,Will do.
Andy Dwyer,Ann Perkins! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Tell me your least favorite things you have to do every day, and I'll do them for a month."
Andy Dwyer,Let me just look for that form.
Andy Dwyer,Nine things April hates to do.
Andy Dwyer,Why would you do that?
Andy Dwyer,Let me just wolf down this peanut brittle real quick.
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be fine.
Andy Dwyer,Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer,I already won all the magazine mazes.
Andy Dwyer,I'm not going back there.
Andy Dwyer,No way.
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"But I couldn't possibly, because I'm just a beginner."
Andy Dwyer,I am a goddess.
Andy Dwyer,A glorious female warrior.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, maybe I should."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm trying to stop April from taking a job with Chris, so I'm doing everything she hates doing for the next month."
Andy Dwyer,She said it might.
Andy Dwyer,"But it's all I've got, man."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,But cool like a son.
Andy Dwyer,Like a grandpa.
Andy Dwyer,"Like a cool uncle, but old."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, right."
Andy Dwyer,Noo!
Andy Dwyer,'Cause calories.
Andy Dwyer,Cute kid.
Andy Dwyer,"Number one, run the permits desk for an hour."
Andy Dwyer,That's no problem.
Andy Dwyer,I was secretly an undercover rock star this whole time.
Andy Dwyer,Guess what.
Andy Dwyer,"I eat ""running the permits desk for an hour"" for breakfast."
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,That's-- Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,"Goodbye, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, Henry."
Andy Dwyer,Who are you?
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, strange person who I have never met before."
Andy Dwyer,"So do I strip down to my underwear, or all the way naked?"
Andy Dwyer,"Also, the inside of my mouth is black and hot."
Andy Dwyer,"When it's all said and done, there were a few mazes I'd cheated on."
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks for doing this, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Nothing, it's none of my business."
Andy Dwyer,"It's rock and roll, my friend."
Andy Dwyer,The kind that sticks in your brain.
Andy Dwyer,"Loud, fast, smooth, handsome rock."
Andy Dwyer,You are amazing! I like when you hang out here.
Andy Dwyer,I'm already bored.
Andy Dwyer,Four weeks.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"I barely haven't even ever seen a ""gortar."
Andy Dwyer,"That's why you know even though you're not my dad, you're like an old brother to me."
Andy Dwyer,There's got to be something that I can do to convince you how much I care about you.
Andy Dwyer,You can't go to Indianapolis.
Andy Dwyer,Hands in the air!
Andy Dwyer,FBI!
Andy Dwyer,One of the most significant bummers of my lifetime.
Andy Dwyer,Freeze!
Andy Dwyer,Thank you!
Andy Dwyer,I love you!
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Now that I've convinced you, why don't we go dance?"
Andy Dwyer,It's not a good movie.
Andy Dwyer,It's just-- it's not good.
Andy Dwyer,"But then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth time I watched it, I realized something."
Andy Dwyer,"Third time, it was okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Second time, hated it."
Andy Dwyer,"First time, hated it."
Andy Dwyer,It's like the movie Expendables 2.
Andy Dwyer,"If you give this a chance, you're gonna love it, I promise."
Andy Dwyer,Like flowers on the sunset of an eagle's poetry.
Andy Dwyer,The bloom of youth.
Andy Dwyer,Look around.
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,"For, like, a week and a half."
Andy Dwyer,Or after.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,I didn't even have time to take a shower before my wedding.
Andy Dwyer,Mmmm.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, mine's impossible."
Andy Dwyer,Keep the spiral tight.
Andy Dwyer,Could you do me the honor?
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, Mr. Andrew Luck, it's every groom's dream to catch a touchdown pass thrown by you."
Andy Dwyer,"Andy Dwyer will be taking ""women's lasers."""
Andy Dwyer,"Well, then, it's decided."
Andy Dwyer,That's no joke.
Andy Dwyer,I got married in your jersey.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't look at you, Reggie Wayne."
Andy Dwyer,Reggie Wayne.
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm gonna make my choice as I always do, at random."
Andy Dwyer,Now I want to try something that I want to try.
Andy Dwyer,"Look, you guys have already had your say."
Andy Dwyer,Why would I take a class on something that's already happened?
Andy Dwyer,"I can't tell if you're joking, but I hope you're not."
Andy Dwyer,I love them like they're my own children.
Andy Dwyer,"I love your team, sir."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,I knew it.
Andy Dwyer,And this is what heaven is like.
Andy Dwyer,I am dead.
Andy Dwyer,I'm dead.
Andy Dwyer,Alala baby
Andy Dwyer,"I want to see the Colts beat the Patriots 49 to nothing, then I yell at Tom Brady and make him cry, then I hook up with Dave Matthews, and we play golden tee for ten hours."
Andy Dwyer,I want to see a Colts game.
Andy Dwyer,Nothing to see here.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Me and April, we got married with no warning."
Andy Dwyer,"And will we start with the small lasers, or could we go just straight to the big lasers, in terms of playing with them?"
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding me?
Andy Dwyer,It sounds expensive.
Andy Dwyer,"Why don't you stay out of our conversations, Larry!"
Andy Dwyer,I tried to jump it over a lake.
Andy Dwyer,Will you?
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Andy Dwyer,"You're as hot as the sun but you're as cold as ice let me take you to paradise come on, roll the dice it will be twice as nice Sarah Wei-- April Ludgate will you go to prom with me?"
Andy Dwyer,"April Ludgate, I'm gonna sing to you a song that I first wrote 15 years ago for my prom date, Sarah Weiss."
Andy Dwyer,If you guys spot me.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world."
Andy Dwyer,"Or, no, we can't, because they moved to prison."
Andy Dwyer,That'sâ¦ that's where we should have this afterparty.
Andy Dwyer,Her parents used to let us drink as much as we wanted.
Andy Dwyer,Afterparty Megan Rickerson's house.
Andy Dwyer,Photo booth with Monica Lewinsky lookalike.
Andy Dwyer,"Theme: ""My heart will go on."""
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I hope that this prom is exactly like my senior prom."
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Crazy.
Andy Dwyer,I can rewrite the lyrics.
Andy Dwyer,What was that meeting about?
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,That would have been way better.
Andy Dwyer,I think you're lying.
Andy Dwyer,I think I know what that meeting was about.
Andy Dwyer,I ordered a beer.
Andy Dwyer,I never had a bachelor party either.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,He's not even using a laser pointer.
Andy Dwyer,When will you be bringing out the lasers for me to play with?
Andy Dwyer,"Good night, sir."
Andy Dwyer,Curious.
Andy Dwyer,"I wish I could say some of this mess was Ann's, but it's all mine."
Andy Dwyer,Orin!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,"Damn you, Jerry."
Andy Dwyer,Does your mom want to take pictures?
Andy Dwyer,"If you don't show up in a limo, legally, they can't let you in."
Andy Dwyer,Because it's prom.
Andy Dwyer,All this stuff is free.
Andy Dwyer,Would you like a drink?
Andy Dwyer,"Girl, you look creepy."
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Uh-huh!
Andy Dwyer,Class of '99!
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee!
Andy Dwyer,Hah hah yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Hee hee!
Andy Dwyer,I'm kind of a nester.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, there."
Andy Dwyer,Professor?
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, excuse me."
Andy Dwyer,Where are the lasers?
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, huge news."
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I think my tooth looks fine just like this."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"And there's gonna be beer, pumpkins"
Andy Dwyer,Fake ones.
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,We have decorations
Andy Dwyer,"Do you want me to make those changes, or is it good?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Not murdered.
Andy Dwyer,But pictures of dead people from TV or movies.
Andy Dwyer,but fake ones.
Andy Dwyer,"Candy, dancing, Tequila."
Andy Dwyer,All kinds of food and snacks.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry Dinner

Andy Dwyer,You don't have to play the unity concert.
Andy Dwyer,"I once threw beer at a swan, and then it attacked my niece Rebecca."
Andy Dwyer,"When I was a baby, my head was so big scientists did experiments on me."
Andy Dwyer,"When they say 2% milk, I don't know what the other 98% is."
Andy Dwyer,And at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
Andy Dwyer,Oops.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know who Al Gore is.
Andy Dwyer,Of fun!
Andy Dwyer,I think you'll find it's pretty good.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,"So I'll take a beer, too."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I'm pretty boring."
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, I gotta poop, but I could stop anywhere for that."
Andy Dwyer,And a jacket and one of my socks.
Andy Dwyer,'Cause I forgot to put on deodorant.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, if we're going that way, can we stop at our place real quick?"
Andy Dwyer,"You're so cute when you're bullying, babe."

Andy Dwyer,This is for your Gizmo.
Andy Dwyer,Boom.
Andy Dwyer,It's probably just family.
Andy Dwyer,I just forgot where I parked it.
Andy Dwyer,I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.

Andy Dwyer,"Sorry for stepping on you, floor."
Andy Dwyer,"Man, all these classes look amazing."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, when are you gonna tell them about my show?"
Andy Dwyer,April really does this every day?
Andy Dwyer,"It's gonna be a party, so check your suits at the door."
Andy Dwyer,You can't quit.
Andy Dwyer,You're really good.
Andy Dwyer,"No, come on, man."

Andy Dwyer,"Dude, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,And this is all I have to show for it? Totally worth it.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't actually sell my last car.
Andy Dwyer,"If you ever need me, you know where to find me, In bed next to you, probably having sex with you."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, we got to make that meeting."
Andy Dwyer,"To even it out, I'm gonna tell you all of my secrets."
Andy Dwyer,You secret is safe with me.

Andy Dwyer,No blood orphans.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what that is.

Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,My pirate!
Andy Dwyer,Lawrence lives with his grandma.

Andy Dwyer,Hang on.
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, Ron, but what do you know about music?"
Andy Dwyer,That's worked before.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe if I hit my head against the ground.
Andy Dwyer,This is the only way I can help.
Andy Dwyer,Help triangulate the phone call.
Andy Dwyer,Walk around in circles like I am.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't come up with some brilliant political idea, can I?"

Andy Dwyer,I found some thorns.
Andy Dwyer,"Enemies of fairness and equality, hear my womanly roar."

Andy Dwyer,And that little thing you got right there that's called a capo.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, that's a fret."
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,That makes it sexy.
Andy Dwyer,Think about it as roleplaying.
Andy Dwyer,I don't want to end up on that donezo list.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, we have to support Tom."
Andy Dwyer,I found all three differences.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, look."
Andy Dwyer,"Here, let me help you."
Andy Dwyer,What a mess.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Because I do like candy corn.
Andy Dwyer,Or will that be confusing?
Andy Dwyer,Should I put that down?
Andy Dwyer,Or if I'm allergic to anything?
Andy Dwyer,I didn't even know she knew Jerry.
Andy Dwyer,"In the movie Predator, can you rub any kind of mud on yourself to prevent predator from seeing you with his thermal heat signature sight, or is it more-- Ow!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, actually, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,We face them head-on.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, you know, Ron, someone once told me that this is not how grown-ups deal with tough situations."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, Ron you have to tell him what happened."

Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Ron It was you who told me that."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,It's robots.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Guitar for beginners.
Andy Dwyer,"You know, like, when you go to the ATM and you get money, is there an actual guy standing behind the wall who slides dollar bills in there?"
Andy Dwyer,Can I ask you kind of an important question?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, Ron, but April's way sounds way easier."
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Bye-bye.
Andy Dwyer,Yup.

Andy Dwyer,That's crazy.
Andy Dwyer,Fireworks.
Andy Dwyer,I just got us invited to Damian Keating's barn party.
Andy Dwyer,So I think he can get us all free beer.
Andy Dwyer,"No, but my brain is about to explode from stress."
Andy Dwyer,"I know that, legally, Ann is now mine, but it weirdly doesn't feel that way."
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Give me a twirl.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello ma'am, who is just as equal as man, I would like one ticket for, uh, women."

Andy Dwyer,"Chop, chop, kick Chop, kick-kick-kick And a chop and a kick and a kick and a No."
Andy Dwyer,"Harmony! Oh, my God!"
Andy Dwyer,"Look, you don't have to worry about me bothering you anymore."
Andy Dwyer,I am not good at keeping secrets.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, your turn."
Andy Dwyer,That's exactly what I told Kyle when he told me his wife was cheating on him.
Andy Dwyer,See?
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Auction?
Andy Dwyer,Geez.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God, no!"
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, that wall's so close."

Andy Dwyer,People keep secrets.
Andy Dwyer,People do this.
Andy Dwyer,I can do this.
Andy Dwyer,Why didn't you tell me it was so expensive?
Andy Dwyer,"Not him, not that Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,Wait.
Andy Dwyer,Chop and a chop and a kick-kick-kick-kick chop And tighten the throat And chop-a-kick chop

Andy Dwyer,"Listen, I know that you and the band aren't on the best of terms right now."
Andy Dwyer,No need.
Andy Dwyer,To convince you to reunite Land Ho.
Andy Dwyer,You gotta tell me about him.
Andy Dwyer,We just need 10 minutes of your time.
Andy Dwyer,And this barfing lady over here is Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,My name's Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, hi."
Andy Dwyer,It's Scott Tanner.
Andy Dwyer,Scott Tanner.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know anything about him.

Andy Dwyer,Same way I got a perfect score on the SATs.
Andy Dwyer,Brokeback Mountain DVD.
Andy Dwyer,Fellows love that.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's amazing."
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,Pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,That's a sign for petting a dog that's sitting on your lap.
Andy Dwyer,"Does he already have, like, chaps?"
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were getting a dog.
Andy Dwyer,Like assless chaps?
Andy Dwyer,Leslie!
Andy Dwyer,But bringing people together is exactly what we want to talk to you about.
Andy Dwyer,Just listen to me.
Andy Dwyer,Hold that.
Andy Dwyer,My only plan was to buy Skittles.
Andy Dwyer,"You clearly have something going, and I should respect that."
Andy Dwyer,"Scott, you sing."
Andy Dwyer,"Karate chop master I'm a karate chop master And I will karate chop you Chop, chop, chop, chop Kick, kick, kick, kick, chop"

Andy Dwyer,"You remembered how much I like to say ""psych."""
Andy Dwyer,I'm also a children's performer.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it is."
Andy Dwyer,"But no, no."
Andy Dwyer,This is no psych.
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,"Catapult me into the Sun, and I'll burn, baby, burn."
Andy Dwyer,"Goodbye, A-Cakes."
Andy Dwyer,And we cover about five of your songs and they just go nuts.
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm in a band myself, actually."
Andy Dwyer,"You know, this town still loves you."
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,"Goodbye, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, oh."
Andy Dwyer,"I thought for a second you were gonna chase after me right there, but you didn't, and that's okay."
Andy Dwyer,I meant every word I said.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look, a handgun."
Andy Dwyer,I call it.
Andy Dwyer,Hold that down at the bottom.
Andy Dwyer,Holy crap!
Andy Dwyer,"No, not according to my file here."
Andy Dwyer,Crap.
Andy Dwyer,"We're raising money for my college education, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Is that a question?
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, we fought a lot."
Andy Dwyer,"God, I think so."
Andy Dwyer,Shoot.
Andy Dwyer,"Someone had a pool table growing up, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,What do you say we play again?
Andy Dwyer,Whoa! Hey! What the hell? Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were a dude.
Andy Dwyer,We'll make it a little more interesting.
Andy Dwyer,Go double or nothing?
Andy Dwyer,Step two.
Andy Dwyer,Lose to your opponent intentionally so they gain confidence.
Andy Dwyer,Wrist lock.
Andy Dwyer,Very easily.
Andy Dwyer,Mark is pretty good at pool.
Andy Dwyer,"Good call, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, that's the reason."
Andy Dwyer,He has some kind of disease.
Andy Dwyer,He is very sick.
Andy Dwyer,It's about Larry.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I was the screw-up."
Andy Dwyer,Tell me now.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,I don't wanna break my promise.
Andy Dwyer,I took a second job back at my old job.
Andy Dwyer,So what if those kids think you're the lamest guy in the world?
Andy Dwyer,Can I borrow 1500 dollars? You're not allowed to ask what it's for.
Andy Dwyer,"You're a good friend, Ben."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check it out."
Andy Dwyer,They got pool.
Andy Dwyer,"I didn't mean to say ""Bye."""
Andy Dwyer,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Mark, you want to play a quick game?"
Andy Dwyer,Finally settle the debate about who's the better pool player?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, well, then, that sucks."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, we'll put a little money on it."
Andy Dwyer,Make it a little more interesting.
Andy Dwyer,I am hanging on by a thread over here.
Andy Dwyer,Can I just please tell just April?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, are you serious?"
Andy Dwyer,"No, I just figured because pool is all about angles and he's a failed architect that he might want to play pool."
Andy Dwyer,"That's not who you want shopping at RentASwag anyways, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember applying for
Andy Dwyer,I don't think so.
Andy Dwyer,"How to hustle somebody in pool, by Andy Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,"Step one, find the person you want to hustle."
Andy Dwyer,Invite them to play pool.
Andy Dwyer,"Should they accept, you're in."
Andy Dwyer,Do you want a shoe shine?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I forgot, other hand."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, don't make me tell."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,What was that? What was that?
Andy Dwyer,Can I get you a drink?
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, I do not really understand what is going on right now."
Andy Dwyer,"But no matter what, you must keep going."
Andy Dwyer,Pigs are awesome!
Andy Dwyer,You must stop.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, buddy."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I can swing it."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna beg for money in the street like a drug addict.
Andy Dwyer,Follow your dreams.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,That's embarrassing.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben, the pig ate your noise canceling headphones."
Andy Dwyer,I have to get back to work now.
Andy Dwyer,Excuse me.
Andy Dwyer,You're acting weird.
Andy Dwyer,I'm not acting weird.
Andy Dwyer,I don't have anything.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, it is nothing."
Andy Dwyer,Or wait.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, that's not one."
Andy Dwyer,Can I get you a drink?
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, this is hours' worth of work."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, you have to catalog all this stuff."
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Good, I need one."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, you were an awesome girlfriend."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Mark is way better than me.
Andy Dwyer,And I am Mother Nature's brother: Brother nature.
Andy Dwyer,But you can call me Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Or brother nature.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna... I'm gonna say that there is at least a chance that I didn't think this through completely.
Andy Dwyer,Your call.
Andy Dwyer,Brother nature.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Forget money.
Andy Dwyer,We'll play for something else.
Andy Dwyer,I have a T-shirt I tackled Eddie Vedder in.
Andy Dwyer,It's literally priceless.
Andy Dwyer,What are you talking about?
Andy Dwyer,"That doesn't seem like a very fair bet, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,"So, if I win, I also get Ann."
Andy Dwyer,Did you know his greatgrandfather was Spuds Mackenzie?
Andy Dwyer,How are you?
Andy Dwyer,He's pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you, too."
Andy Dwyer,"That's awesome, man."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, do you guys wanna live here with us and Ben and champion, the three legged dog?"
Andy Dwyer,Barkeep.
Andy Dwyer,You're not messing around.
Andy Dwyer,This cat was in Boogie Nights?
Andy Dwyer,"He's captain of the soccer team, and he has a fake I.D."
Andy Dwyer,Pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,Why are you asking me?
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,You need to go outside now?
Andy Dwyer,I just thought maybe they could get Bob Dylan to come.
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,"I guess, now that we've got Chipp McCapp as our headliner, I can get rid of my awesome wish list."
Andy Dwyer,What will happen to all the other animals?
Andy Dwyer,And she's addicted to spanking.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah you gotta dream up some weird scenario like you're her boss and sex is forbidden because she works for you.
Andy Dwyer,Ann is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,"She takes care of me, she takes care of sick people, sick babies."
Andy Dwyer,"You should try roleplay, that's what me and April do."
Andy Dwyer,She is an angel.
Andy Dwyer,That'd be my number one pick.
Andy Dwyer,And I seriously love her.
Andy Dwyer,Hard.
Andy Dwyer,Let's play it again.
Andy Dwyer,She's going to be gone for the next 24 hours so I made this list and basically this place is gonna be like a sparkling palace when she returns.
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's too simple."
Andy Dwyer,Because of the animal?
Andy Dwyer,Chippmunks.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know why.
Andy Dwyer,That's what his fans call themselves.
Andy Dwyer,We are huge Chippmunks.
Andy Dwyer,"Is there such thing as ""women's lasers""?"
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"What, champion?"
Andy Dwyer,Chipp McCapp!
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, let me ask you a quick question."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Can I go out with someone younger than that?
Andy Dwyer,What if she's slightly younger?
Andy Dwyer,Here's the thing.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, get him a pet snake, but I keep it."
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, that guy's the best."
Andy Dwyer,We got the same thing with the equation on that one.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Andy Dwyer,I'll try.
Andy Dwyer,21 years old and a half.
Andy Dwyer,Don't expect much.
Andy Dwyer,21
Andy Dwyer,20 years old.
Andy Dwyer,That's only 20... Is...
Andy Dwyer,Add seven.
Andy Dwyer,Oh! Oh! That's--
Andy Dwyer,20 dollars?
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm 29, so half of 29."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, you know, we're really looking for donations more in the $10,000 range."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, okay."
Andy Dwyer,Half my age plus seven.
Andy Dwyer,"What's the youngest a girl can be that if we go out, I'm not a total scumbag?"
Andy Dwyer,Reggie Wayne!
Andy Dwyer,You will?
Andy Dwyer,Tom says it's okay.
Andy Dwyer,Guess who I just secured as the headliner for the Unity Concert.
Andy Dwyer,I took a bunch of painkillers.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you're all set."
Andy Dwyer,"Free of charge, of course."
Andy Dwyer,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer,That is a brilliant idea.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot believe I didn't think of that.
Andy Dwyer,I have been writing a lot of songs about shining shoes lately.
Andy Dwyer,I tend to write about what I'm doing.
Andy Dwyer,"Talking about writing about what I'm doing, Now I'm singing about talking about writing about what I'm doing"
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, is that a new mix? It sounds way better."
Andy Dwyer,Where's that saxophone coming from?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Chuck, go ahead and just delete everything, all right?"
Andy Dwyer,"It's brilliant about a billion times better than Catch Your Dreams, which I realize now sucks ass."
Andy Dwyer,I wrote a new song it's called The Promise Of Tomorrow's Wings.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, guys, here's the deal, we got to completely start over."
Andy Dwyer,I think the extra length could help us get us over that lake.
Andy Dwyer,We got that limo for three more hours.
Andy Dwyer,Let's bail.
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,"The only thing that matters is that we found each other right now, and it's the best."
Andy Dwyer,But that's because kids in high school are idiots.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, maybe we wouldn't have gotten together if we were in high school."
Andy Dwyer,Why aren't you having fun?
Andy Dwyer,What's wrong? There's cupcakes and music.
Andy Dwyer,"Touchdown, Dwyer!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, well, here's something that's going to make you feel really good."
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Andy Dwyer,The Colts!
Andy Dwyer,"""Women's studies."""
Andy Dwyer,They're about to kick in so I'm ready to go.
Andy Dwyer,How's it going with her?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my Sorry."
Andy Dwyer,Hold on.
Andy Dwyer,I do have one question.
Andy Dwyer,"I'd have to check, but I'm pretty sure we can handle that."
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,"God, I cannot stop thinking about lasers."
Andy Dwyer,That a boy.
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, he's hates awkward situations."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, a little tradition after Mouse Rat records, someone buys me booze, who's it gonna be?"
Andy Dwyer,Whoo!
Andy Dwyer,"Nice work, guys."
Andy Dwyer,I can get on board with that.
Andy Dwyer,I rigged an election and got kicked out of prom.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you're having fun now."
Andy Dwyer,High school forever!
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Andy Dwyer,Always next year.
Andy Dwyer,Give me this.
Andy Dwyer,"Silence! My first decree of power is to declare that the prom queen shall be my wife, April Ludgate, who is the best thing that's ever happened to me who came to prom even though she hates it."
Andy Dwyer,"As your prom king, I'm your ruler."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Pawnee High."
Andy Dwyer,Not without my queen.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,That probably means it isn't okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,She didn't do that.
Andy Dwyer,That was-- I think it sounds like it was Macklin's call.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm playing football with my friends.
Andy Dwyer,Lucas Oil Stadium.
Andy Dwyer,I'm standing on the field.
Andy Dwyer,And I met Jim Irsay.
Andy Dwyer,I met Reggie Wayne today.
Andy Dwyer,I met Andrew Luck today.
Andy Dwyer,Greatest day of my life.
Andy Dwyer,"How great a day was today? Oh, God, I could die."
Andy Dwyer,But you can't treat your dad like that.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, it sucks that they didn't have ham."
Andy Dwyer,This guy's the worst.
Andy Dwyer,Ew!
Andy Dwyer,I know you boosted those paintings.
Andy Dwyer,"Shut up, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin may be dead, but I'm his brother Kip Hackman."
Andy Dwyer,You think I'd let you get away that easily?
Andy Dwyer,Can you do it?
Andy Dwyer,We wanted to talk to you about the Unity Concert in Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,Miss Snakehole.
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, but Bert Macklin died last night after the tenth shot of Snake Juice."
Andy Dwyer,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, please."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Kyle, please stop talking."
Andy Dwyer,I'll justâ¦
Andy Dwyer,The White House America's most whitest house most notably is where Sinbad lived in the film First Kid.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"And then this third guy was like, ""I would."""
Andy Dwyer,You and Ben can handle anything.
Andy Dwyer,But just because your family is getting bigger does not mean that you can't handle it.
Andy Dwyer,"And yes, this moment may be the biggest curve you've ever had to deal with."
Andy Dwyer,"You know, Leslie, sometimes life throws us crazy curves."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Chris."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, I'll tell you what."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna think about it.
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were going to punch that kid's lights out.
Andy Dwyer,You were great.
Andy Dwyer,That was awesome.
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,Ron Swanson has sent me over to deliver to you this document.
Andy Dwyer,"Through the course of all day, I'm gonna mull it over."
Andy Dwyer,"It's all I'm gonna think about, but you're in good hands."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm gonna come up with something really, really good."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,You got that?
Andy Dwyer,Where's free Skittles?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I don't know if this is important or not, but I have heard a lot of very, very interesting chatter around the shoeshine stand today."
Andy Dwyer,A lot of things.
Andy Dwyer,"Like, ""Can you believe it?"""
Andy Dwyer,"and, ""The Parks lady boned Dexhart,"" and, ""Of course she did, she's totally good to go."""
Andy Dwyer,"And one guy was like, ""I wouldn't hit that."""
Andy Dwyer,"And the other guy was like, ""Me neither."""
Andy Dwyer,So I don't know if that's helpful at all.
Andy Dwyer,I got dinner.
Andy Dwyer,Do you know why it's called the Oval Office? No.
Andy Dwyer,You take care of April.
Andy Dwyer,"And I do, slowly."
Andy Dwyer,I have to.
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm planning to kick your ass, but I see how happy you make her, and I have to walk away."
Andy Dwyer,I spy on you from my red Corvette.
Andy Dwyer,And I come back.
Andy Dwyer,I was faking it.
Andy Dwyer,Only I didn't really die.
Andy Dwyer,"Strange, but sweet."
Andy Dwyer,"And it makes me sad, but if she's gonna be with somebody, I'd like it to be you."
Andy Dwyer,And then you go marry April.
Andy Dwyer,Pbbbt.
Andy Dwyer,Skydiving explosion.
Andy Dwyer,This counts as one.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe I die.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe it's April.
Andy Dwyer,Two?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I guess while you get your medicine, I'll just stroll through the candy aisles, but won't get any."
Andy Dwyer,Heimlich!
Andy Dwyer,It is if you do it right.
Andy Dwyer,Or karate.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, if you do collapse, luckily, I know first aid."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Are you sure you're feeling up for this, boss?"
Andy Dwyer,Farts and poop and love and stuff Macaroni salad
Andy Dwyer,Turn this music down.
Andy Dwyer,In a rainstorm.
Andy Dwyer,Because of a man Oval Redenbacher
Andy Dwyer,"But as time goes by, it eats away at me."
Andy Dwyer,"Man, you were in the bathroom forever."
Andy Dwyer,"I forgive you, bro."
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, that's sweet."
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were my friend!
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine.
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,I've been thinking about your gay boyfriend all day.
Andy Dwyer,I have got some awesome ideas.
Andy Dwyer,"First idea, spray tan gift certificates."
Andy Dwyer,Trip to Germany?
Andy Dwyer,Germany is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't think of that.
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
Andy Dwyer,"Indianapolis Colts' Reggie Wayne jersey, number 87, double XL, home blue, signed by Reggie Wayne right after he catches a touchdown to win the Super Bowl."
Andy Dwyer,No?
Andy Dwyer,Hip Hop Abs dance fitness DVD?

Andy Dwyer,He used to hang out with John F. Kennedy.
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were my friend.
Andy Dwyer,Training.
Andy Dwyer,In a cave.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm alone.
Andy Dwyer,The receptionist said that Chipp will be out in just a second.
Andy Dwyer,You're out living it up with my wife.
Andy Dwyer,"Boom, too much pain, you can't even hit me."
Andy Dwyer,Let me write that down.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, yeah, won't be needing that."
Andy Dwyer,Even better.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Blimp time.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hell, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"Cherry, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I have just one question."
Andy Dwyer,"Ben is ""eagle two."""
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, code name: ""If I had to pick a dude."""
Andy Dwyer,"Donna is ""it happened once in a dream."""
Andy Dwyer,"April is ""currently doing that."""
Andy Dwyer,I'd love to take that bastard down.
Andy Dwyer,"Voldemort Putin, of Russia?"
Andy Dwyer,Was it Putin?
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, code name: ""Been there, done that."""
Andy Dwyer,"I was not going to eat it, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,I was going to lick it.
Andy Dwyer,"You can address me as ""eagle one."""
Andy Dwyer,"Also, from now on, we'll be using code names."
Andy Dwyer,"Always remember, kids, when you find something new, you must lick it before you eat it."
Andy Dwyer,"As you know, when we reach the location, I will be conducting a security sweep."
Andy Dwyer,We have a security situation here.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, listen up, folks."
Andy Dwyer,"If you are watching, perpetrator, just know that you are still at large."
Andy Dwyer,This is Bert Macklin's greatest assignment yet.
Andy Dwyer,"You're welcome, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,How are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Step one, let's go make something."
Andy Dwyer,Yes?
Andy Dwyer,I don't even really have a home.
Andy Dwyer,Dennis Feinstein.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay! Okay, thanks, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"And as always, when we accidentally end up doing Loose Animal in the Studio, we have to show you this disclaimer."
Andy Dwyer,Boring.
Andy Dwyer,Here's a disclaimer.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't read this disclaimer.
Andy Dwyer,He makes people do the right thing.
Andy Dwyer,Jonathan Karate tells it like it is.
Andy Dwyer,"In those very special episodes, I become Jonathan Karate, the very serious older brother of Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,"Occasionally on my show, we deal with real issues like bullying, peer pressure, or holding in farts."
Andy Dwyer,Exactly.
Andy Dwyer,That's what makes him the best.
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Andy Dwyer,The appointment should be under Karate.
Andy Dwyer,We are here to see Dennis Feinstein.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Good point.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, kids."
Andy Dwyer,So be on the lookout for a-- What's it called?
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, kids, well, we've got a lot of work to do performing the Five Karate Moves to Success."
Andy Dwyer,Sing it with me!
Andy Dwyer,"Today we're going to make something, learn something, karate chop something. And then we'll try something new, even if it's scary to you."
Andy Dwyer,"And finally we'll have some fun being nice to someone, Because that's the Johnny Karate way"
Andy Dwyer,Jonathan Karate.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, April."
Andy Dwyer,Three!
Andy Dwyer,Do you like the flowers?
Andy Dwyer,And the next day.
Andy Dwyer,Not Friday.
Andy Dwyer,I have to go visit my cousin.
Andy Dwyer,"Nothing is impossible, kids."
Andy Dwyer,But I will be back after that to ask you again.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Really? That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"So, so fun."
Andy Dwyer,I'll see you tomorrow.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Mailman Barry!"
Andy Dwyer,Who brought me mail today?
Andy Dwyer,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,You don't even have to pay me.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, did you hear that?"
Andy Dwyer,It's time to karate chop something!
Andy Dwyer,"Ninjas, attack!"
Andy Dwyer,Disperse!
Andy Dwyer,"Remember, never attack a real postal employee."
Andy Dwyer,We're allowed to attack Mailman Barry because he volunteered to help us with our karate moves.
Andy Dwyer,"Next up, we're going to try something new with my good friend Leslie Knope."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I'm glad you're here to teach us all how to be brave.
Andy Dwyer,"So, Leslie, what are you going to be trying new this week?"
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, he doesn't have any new emails."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything."
Andy Dwyer,My name is Jonathan Karate.
Andy Dwyer,I will prove myself.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I'm gonna work my ass off for you."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, wow."
Andy Dwyer,That is really good.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, kids."
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm sorry."
Andy Dwyer,This tastes great.
Andy Dwyer,All my favorite foods have butter on 'em.
Andy Dwyer,"This, to me, seems like a hug moment."
Andy Dwyer,"Pancakes, toast, popcorn, grapes."
Andy Dwyer,Butter is my favorite food.
Andy Dwyer,"All due respect, Eduardo. You seem like a great guy."
Andy Dwyer,But I like April.
Andy Dwyer,"His name is Champion, because he's the dog world champion."
Andy Dwyer,I'll do anything you ask me.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, kids, it's time for our next karate move to success."
Andy Dwyer,"So, do you want to go out with me? No."
Andy Dwyer,Let's learn something.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Professor Smartbrain!"
Andy Dwyer,That's a good boy.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh my gosh, there you are, puppy."
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were going to say yes.
Andy Dwyer,But that's okay.
Andy Dwyer,Because I'll be back tomorrow to ask you again.
Andy Dwyer,Not the fastest.
Andy Dwyer,And again the next day.
Andy Dwyer,Honey.
Andy Dwyer,What about teleporting?
Andy Dwyer,And I'm coming after her with everything I've got.
Andy Dwyer,We need to talk.
Andy Dwyer,I'm not.
Andy Dwyer,Loose Animal in the Studio.
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,Don't get me wrong.
Andy Dwyer,I dedicate this victory to April Ludgate.
Andy Dwyer,"That's good, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Johnny Karate's guitar has been stolen.
Andy Dwyer,That instrument is worth literally 900 million dollars.
Andy Dwyer,Shoe shining has been a been a pretty wild ride.
Andy Dwyer,But is it possible there's something more out there for me?
Andy Dwyer,It feels good.
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,"But more importantly, he can't play the goodbye song without it."
Andy Dwyer,And it feels sticky.
Andy Dwyer,We'd definitely get on a prank show.
Andy Dwyer,"What if we steal the keys to Feinstein's building, break in, and TP his office, film the whole thing."
Andy Dwyer,There's gotta be another way.
Andy Dwyer,Screw that.
Andy Dwyer,From the Gatorade.
Andy Dwyer,All that and more on the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show!
Andy Dwyer,"It's time to punch boredom in its stupid face Jump, kick, punch and drop And dropkick sadness into outer space Punch, yeah, till you drop It's the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story."
Andy Dwyer,"So, karate masters, you are here for an extra awesome and super special episode of Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,And that is because it's my final show.
Andy Dwyer,Don't look glum.
Andy Dwyer,"So by the time this show is over I will find who stole it, and they will pay the ultimate price."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Someone has stolen my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,This seems like a case for Special Agent Burt Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't give a crap, Batman."
Andy Dwyer,You work for me.
Andy Dwyer,Increase the perimeter!
Andy Dwyer,It's to be the biggest rock star on the planet obviously.
Andy Dwyer,"And suddenly, I was like, ""What if we got married tomorrow?"""
Andy Dwyer,We were hanging out.
Andy Dwyer,"Get off my back, Chief!"
Andy Dwyer,I'm doing the best I can.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't play by the rules, but I get results."
Andy Dwyer,Reverse psychiatry.
Andy Dwyer,But that could take another three to five years
Andy Dwyer,"I don't want to talk to you, anyways."
Andy Dwyer,Will you just stop and listen to me?
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,You're dismissed.
Andy Dwyer,No way!
Andy Dwyer,We won?
Andy Dwyer,This case just keeps getting deeper and deeper.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm drowning in the adult end of the pool, and the lifeguard's off in the bathroom pooping."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man!"
Andy Dwyer,Eat it!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,I hate this place.
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, this is amazing."
Andy Dwyer,"In a couple of weeks, I'll be moving to Washington, D.C."
Andy Dwyer,"This is ""eagle one,"" ""been there, done that"" is leaving the stage."
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's not."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"How do you say, ""Have a great time, don't choke on anything""?"
Andy Dwyer,Uh-oh.
Andy Dwyer,Don't look at me.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what happened.
Andy Dwyer,I took it out to play hide and seek.
Andy Dwyer,I couldn't find it.
Andy Dwyer,Scatter.
Andy Dwyer,Ninjas!
Andy Dwyer,And Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I got my answer."
Andy Dwyer,It was so stupid and it meant nothing.
Andy Dwyer,About April.
Andy Dwyer,Then come with me.
Andy Dwyer,She hates me.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,He can do more with three legs than most dogs can do with four.
Andy Dwyer,That's what happened.
Andy Dwyer,"And she got a boyfriend, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you ask the people gathering outside of your building right now?
Andy Dwyer,From some city in Mexico.
Andy Dwyer,So what do I do?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, once again, April's Animal Corner has turned into one of our favorite segments."
Andy Dwyer,I heard you were buying JJ's Diner and kicking everybody out.
Andy Dwyer,Tell the people that JJ's can stay.
Andy Dwyer,"""I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it"" is in position."
Andy Dwyer,And you remember what you said about making decisions in the house?
Andy Dwyer,Because of what happened.
Andy Dwyer,It's the capital of the entire world.
Andy Dwyer,"They have things there like this white house, and this mental institution."
Andy Dwyer,"And my very favorite, the Lincoln Memorial."
Andy Dwyer,It's this crazy statue of this giant monster sitting on a chair that represents all of America's enemies.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,I'll be moving to Washington D.C.
Andy Dwyer,"April! April! Where have you been? Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Because my wife, April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer, has accepted an amazing job there."
Andy Dwyer,How are you?
Andy Dwyer,I'm very proud of her and totally in love.
Andy Dwyer,I'm dying to see you.
Andy Dwyer,"I called and I texted you, like, a billion times."
Andy Dwyer,Ann kissing me? I am so sorry about that.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,And I had nothing better to do.
Andy Dwyer,Take a bow for being so cool.
Andy Dwyer,Really? Wow.
Andy Dwyer,Across the pond.
Andy Dwyer,I'm doing it for free.
Andy Dwyer,"Kyle, beat it."
Andy Dwyer,I wanna make out with my wife now.
Andy Dwyer,Here.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,I thought maybe I would have heard from you at least once.
Andy Dwyer,Now I haven't done anything.
Andy Dwyer,"Scram, kid."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you come on out and talk to the children?
Andy Dwyer,All we need is a blimp and a decoy blimp.
Andy Dwyer,I've got something big and exciting.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to say.
Andy Dwyer,And hornets came out.
Andy Dwyer,"And I threw a rock at it, and it exploded."
Andy Dwyer,"And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest."
Andy Dwyer,That's so sweet.
Andy Dwyer,And my second Bruce Lee movie.
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie.
Andy Dwyer,Go home.
Andy Dwyer,Gunderson was mayor my entire life.
Andy Dwyer,It really makes you consider the postulence of time.
Andy Dwyer,"The craziest thing is it's, like, super loud."
Andy Dwyer,"This time he says, ""nope."""
Andy Dwyer,""" And then they come back in a rainstorm."""
Andy Dwyer,You know what I mean?
Andy Dwyer,"Was he killed by a younger, stronger barber?"
Andy Dwyer,Your mom sounds kickass.
Andy Dwyer,"""Then you're not changing anything."""
Andy Dwyer,"And he's like, ""you bringing any weapons?"" They're like, ""of course not."""
Andy Dwyer,A whole lot!
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.
Andy Dwyer,I just invented it.
Andy Dwyer,We're gonna change things.
Andy Dwyer,"And they're like, ""yeah, we know."""
Andy Dwyer,The human head weighs 8 pounds.
Andy Dwyer,Also I'm hungry.
Andy Dwyer,Do I have to tuck my shirt in?
Andy Dwyer,"Because, honestly, that's kind of a deal breaker."
Andy Dwyer,Go home.
Andy Dwyer,"And he's like, ""it's a war zone up there."""
Andy Dwyer,"The point is, obviously, you do not throw rocks at a hornet's nest."
Andy Dwyer,And I'm seeing double.
Andy Dwyer,"If we can't get the rights, I'm gonna walk."
Andy Dwyer,But Johnny Karate is special to me.
Andy Dwyer,Those are actually pretty great.
Andy Dwyer,Okay?
Andy Dwyer,But I invented the character.
Andy Dwyer,I did it.
Andy Dwyer,Now I can go finish the show.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it's time for us to go But I want you to all to know That karate's not about fighting It's about knowing who you are And being kind and honest While you're kicking for the stars Yeah, that's the Johnny Karate way Keep karate in your heart And aspire to your dreams And always remember you're forever on my team Yeah, that's the Johnny Karate way Karate yell! Hiya! Goodbye, Pawnee! I will miss you."
Andy Dwyer,500 whats?
Andy Dwyer,Surprise!
Andy Dwyer,"Up in horsey heaven Here's the thing You trade your legs for angel's wings And once we've all said goodbye You take a running leap and you learn to fly Byebye, Li'I Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Byebye, Li'I Sebastian You're 5,000 candles in the wind Hey, why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone?"
Andy Dwyer,"This song is called 5,000 Candles in the Wind."
Andy Dwyer,"And I got a song stuck in my head, and my teeth hurt."
Andy Dwyer,"What's 5,000 times better than a candle in the wind?"
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Andy Dwyer,Why didn't you call me back?
Andy Dwyer,I called you a gajillion times.
Andy Dwyer,Excuse me.
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,"Javelin, if need be."
Andy Dwyer,"Andy Dwyer, security, sweets, body man."
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's just like driving half a car."
Andy Dwyer,Just got a headache.
Andy Dwyer,Am I talking loud right now?
Andy Dwyer,"I was on it for only five minutes, and I can't really hear anything."
Andy Dwyer,You want some help with that?
Andy Dwyer,So we go to Washington D.C. and then we figure out the next cool and awesome thing from there.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, wait."
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, see you tomorrow, Jerry."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna take care of this for us.
Andy Dwyer,I've been playing Xbox for years.
Andy Dwyer,I'm really good at fixing it when it freezes.
Andy Dwyer,I know exactly what to do.
Andy Dwyer,Try it now.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, seriously, where are we?"
Andy Dwyer,What's everybody where are we?
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,"Attention, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,Mesdames and Missoirs.
Andy Dwyer,"If you would do me the obligation of having your honor, heretofore, in the room doth right over there, hence."
Andy Dwyer,"Secondly, your man is here."
Andy Dwyer,"Big event in that room, 15 minutes."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, the surprise is you are not actually at a dinner party."
Andy Dwyer,You're at our wedding.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Is it my turn?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you look awful familiar."
Andy Dwyer,Have we met before?
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's not it."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I typed your symptoms into the thing up here, and it says you could have ""network connectivity problems""."
Andy Dwyer,Are you in my Frisbee golf league?
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, guys, remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later?"
Andy Dwyer,Where is April?
Andy Dwyer,"First of all, you did the right thing by hiding under this table."
Andy Dwyer,Calm down.
Andy Dwyer,Got your message.
Andy Dwyer,Where are you?
Andy Dwyer,Is she all right?
Andy Dwyer,Why are you hiding?
Andy Dwyer,Should I hide too?
Andy Dwyer,What's going on?
Andy Dwyer,"And they're like, ""we need you to take us upriver."""
Andy Dwyer,"Scrawny Christians, missionaries, come to him, and they're like, ""Are you John Rambo?"" He's like, ""yeah."
Andy Dwyer,We'll be right back after this with some more Johnny Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Another mystery solved!
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yes, technically I did smash my head area into the wall area."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you still got it for me."
Andy Dwyer,Would it be weird if I asked for the day off?
Andy Dwyer,You've really done it this time.
Andy Dwyer,And you put farts in my lunch!
Andy Dwyer,You stole my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,"We meet again, Puppy Hating Dan."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, no, it's okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I'm good."
Andy Dwyer,"Point is, I have a gold record."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't think so.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,Neither of your asses are that smart because insurance is for if something bad happens to your car.
Andy Dwyer,P.S. I haven't had it in years.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Puppy Army, attack!"
Andy Dwyer,Let me just grab my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,"As long as I'm with you, I'm going to be happy."
Andy Dwyer,You're what keeps me going.
Andy Dwyer,It's definitely what that guy wants.
Andy Dwyer,To each other.
Andy Dwyer,"I would've chugged that entire gallon of milk, had I not started puking out of nowhere."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"But tonight, me and April are getting married."
Andy Dwyer,Uh It's supposed to be a big surprise.
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Andy Dwyer,My name is Burt Tyrannosaurus Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know what the problem is, Sergeant."
Andy Dwyer,Just drain the ocean.
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Andy Dwyer,How about that?
Andy Dwyer,Sir Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,"April, you're not supposed to let me see you."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,I'm a cop!
Andy Dwyer,I should get some handcuffs too!
Andy Dwyer,"Give me your cuffs, Randy."
Andy Dwyer,"Stand down, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"Professor Smartbrain, this piece of fabric was found at the scene."
Andy Dwyer,Look at it under your telescope.
Andy Dwyer,President Jimmy Carter stole my guitar?
Andy Dwyer,Just firing up the Bagel Bites now.
Andy Dwyer,But why?
Andy Dwyer,I know I am!
Andy Dwyer,"If there's something that you want badly, you just have to believe that it's gonna work out."
Andy Dwyer,"This means so, so much to me."
Andy Dwyer,That's actually really good advice for anything.
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,Your breasts are amazing.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,Seems like he's friends with that mule.
Andy Dwyer,"Literally, because normally I have a script that I have to stick to."
Andy Dwyer,But I don't know what I'm supposed to say right now.
Andy Dwyer,It's kind of a nightmare.
Andy Dwyer,"""Phenomenon"" means ""to explore a cave."""
Andy Dwyer,I was super wasted.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Andy Dwyer,"And now that the show is ending, I'm gonna have to start all over again."
Andy Dwyer,Hopefully there's a pit in Washington D.C. that I could fall into.
Andy Dwyer,"A few days ago, on a routine campaign stop in downtown Pawnee, one Leslie Knope pause was attacked play by a pie."
Andy Dwyer,Still do!
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I lost it."
Andy Dwyer,The day planner's gone.
Andy Dwyer,I can't find it anywhere.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Eddie!"
Andy Dwyer,This is amazing!
Andy Dwyer,"The only evidence we have is a video shot by pause my wife, April Ludgate."
Andy Dwyer,Play.
Andy Dwyer,"Luckily, it only hit Jerry, so no damage was done."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, I don't mind."
Andy Dwyer,Hi.
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, that's so sweet."
Andy Dwyer,You're my Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon.
Andy Dwyer,See? I told you it was gonna work out.
Andy Dwyer,Two points!
Andy Dwyer,"We karate-chopped something, old Mailman Barry's face."
Andy Dwyer,"And we tried something new, even though it was scary to us, with Leslie Knope."
Andy Dwyer,That leaves just one more thing.
Andy Dwyer,The most important one.
Andy Dwyer,Be nice to someone.
Andy Dwyer,And I think I know right now who needs it the most.
Andy Dwyer,"My wife, April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, come on out here."
Andy Dwyer,Come here.
Andy Dwyer,Babe.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Babe? Wait!
Andy Dwyer,We learned something with Professor Smartbrain.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, where are you going? Babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Where are you-- Hey, come here."
Andy Dwyer,"April, what's going on?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but you're what I love."
Andy Dwyer,You're the only reason I have any of this.
Andy Dwyer,"You believed in me, and you supported me, and you make me happy."
Andy Dwyer,Here you go.
Andy Dwyer,Calculator.
Andy Dwyer,Does not go well.
Andy Dwyer,Happier than I ever thought I could be.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, without you, I wouldn't be anything."
Andy Dwyer,"Bottom line, they go upriver."
Andy Dwyer,They go home again.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Totally agree.
Andy Dwyer,We made something with Carpenter Ron.
Andy Dwyer,I once found a rock that looked exactly like Santa Claus.
Andy Dwyer,John Cena in the house!
Andy Dwyer,"John Cena, you're my hero!"
Andy Dwyer,"What's up, boss?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I'm Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm Ted too, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Gotcha!
Andy Dwyer,How?
Andy Dwyer,No way.
Andy Dwyer,We're all Ted!
Andy Dwyer,"Get this, they're gonna pay me the minimum wage."
Andy Dwyer,"Hat and everything, so... Before I say goodbye, let's review our checklist one last time."
Andy Dwyer,There was an opening for a janitor at the TV station.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, good news."
Andy Dwyer,Whoo!
Andy Dwyer,"John Cena, you're a great inspiration, a true hero, and this is the greatest moment of my life."
Andy Dwyer,But you're going down.
Andy Dwyer,You stole Johnny Karate's guitar.
Andy Dwyer,"You're going in the dunk tank, bud."
Andy Dwyer,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Can you believe it, babe?"
Andy Dwyer,I'd like to begin by saying thank you to anyone who has ever worked on the Johnny Karate Musical Explosion Show.
Andy Dwyer,"This has been the greatest job I've ever had, and today has been the best day of my life."
Andy Dwyer,And that's saying something.
Andy Dwyer,I think I found a job.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, why don't you kids help me sing the welcome song?"
Andy Dwyer,"Welcome to the only show that's all about learning, music, animals, fireworks, waterskis, and above all, ice cream, pizza, ninjas, getting stronger, sharks versus bears, and above all, karate!"
Andy Dwyer,Silence!
Andy Dwyer,I think it'd be kinda cool to work for Tom.
Andy Dwyer,This shirt is hilarious.
Andy Dwyer,"Derek and Ben, will you be my best men?"
Andy Dwyer,"All those years together at the Parks Department, and you never told us you had a brother."
Andy Dwyer,But working at a startup can be kind of risky.
Andy Dwyer,But Tom told me to follow my dreams.
Andy Dwyer,Where did you come from?
Andy Dwyer,But this isn't my dream.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to do.
Andy Dwyer,You give such good advice.
Andy Dwyer,You guys are doctors?
Andy Dwyer,Doctors.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so glad you made it.
Andy Dwyer,Hit men?
Andy Dwyer,I'm guessing it's a business?
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like it would be a perfect fit, although I don't know exactly what you guys do here."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, both me and Ben are trying to help April find a new job, and we thought maybe she could work for you."
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's Andrew Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,Tell him it's Count Chocula.
Andy Dwyer,"Ben Wyatt, please?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to round up the team and find her a new job.
Andy Dwyer,I just decided what I'm going to do while April is out of town.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, that's a crazy accident."
Andy Dwyer,He's gonna be so embarrassed.
Andy Dwyer,Assassins?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,That's a real tightrope walk.
Andy Dwyer,"As my manager, what do you think I should do?"
Andy Dwyer,Still.
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Chase me.
Andy Dwyer,That-- Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I want to be with you.
Andy Dwyer,"Would she have an opportunity to practice any ""creative problem solving""?"
Andy Dwyer,Good.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Someone please tell me if Tom is okay.
Andy Dwyer,Quit pulling.
Andy Dwyer,What will she be doing at this job?
Andy Dwyer,Break it down.
Andy Dwyer,I've been there.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Tom, are you okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Lying under oath is called perjury, and they should know, they did it yesterday."
Andy Dwyer,"Fine, I'll let you off the leash."
Andy Dwyer,Shoe shine?
Andy Dwyer,But that can wait.
Andy Dwyer,I'm about to do an experiment where I huck this at the wall and see what happens.
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, you helped me get April back."
Andy Dwyer,Would you be my best man?
Andy Dwyer,The shoeshine stand is gone.
Andy Dwyer,Or maybe it was never here.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, so Tom offered me a job again."
Andy Dwyer,"What the [Bleep], dude?"
Andy Dwyer,April.
Andy Dwyer,That's embarrassing.
Andy Dwyer,Here's your list.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, sorry."
Andy Dwyer,There's an old saying in show business.
Andy Dwyer,But you have got to find somebody.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,He shall do it in the car!
Andy Dwyer,"They're called Rat Mouse, and they're awful."
Andy Dwyer,They tried once.
Andy Dwyer,Please.
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Is there any chance you can fix me in the next 10 minutes?
Andy Dwyer,Give me one reason to take you down.
Andy Dwyer,That's the side that hurts.
Andy Dwyer,My arm!
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Andy Dwyer,"Ben, sorry."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I did it!"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,I'll be back shortly!
Andy Dwyer,I've got to grab my guitar from my house.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.
Andy Dwyer,"You got pickle hair, baby, And you got it from me"
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, kids!"
Andy Dwyer,Pickle?
Andy Dwyer,My last song I wrote was called Sex Hair.
Andy Dwyer,I don't even have children's songs.
Andy Dwyer,I don't really feel like playing right now.
Andy Dwyer,"I would love nothing more Oh, [Bleep]."
Andy Dwyer,That's the list of cool new nicknames I want people to call me.
Andy Dwyer,"""The show must go wrong."""
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, dude, I dare you."
Andy Dwyer,"Apple juice, barbecue sauce, Count Chocula-- Wait."
Andy Dwyer,We've got a whole list of all the things you need out of a new job.
Andy Dwyer,"We've made progress, haven't we?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, don't fret, cookie."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I love you."
Andy Dwyer,A- Cakes.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no."
Andy Dwyer,"Okh, okay, you know when you're just already having a bad day, and then you break all the bones in your arm because you crash your motorcycle?"
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,The Jell-O rainbow.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, whoa, that is awesome."
Andy Dwyer,"Everything always goes wrong, and you just have to deal with it."
Andy Dwyer,"My God, babe, you were so into me."
Andy Dwyer,"If it makes you feel any better, I had a big crush on you too."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,They're sirening back to us.
Andy Dwyer,Thank God.
Andy Dwyer,The police even love it.
Andy Dwyer,"I hope you saved a slice of that cake for your estranged brother, LeVondrious."
Andy Dwyer,Joe!
Andy Dwyer,Donna!
Andy Dwyer,Sewage Joe.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look."
Andy Dwyer,Garry.
Andy Dwyer,"Ben Wyatt fired you for sending pictures of your penis to everyone, and you've come here to ""pie"" him."
Andy Dwyer,That's hilarious.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Let's grab some lunch and some ice cream and then maybe some after ice cream tacos.
Andy Dwyer,"I got ""Money Shot."""
Andy Dwyer,"So, long story short, we might have found you the perfect job."
Andy Dwyer,"But also, I might have blown it."
Andy Dwyer,Roberta!
Andy Dwyer,Ben and Ron are there now to try to fix it.
Andy Dwyer,"And if they don't, I feel like it's kind of on them."
Andy Dwyer,It's because we love you.
Andy Dwyer,We want you to be happy.
Andy Dwyer,This consulting job could be the answer.
Andy Dwyer,Not interested.
Andy Dwyer,New car.
Andy Dwyer,I rubbed my armpits with air fresheners.
Andy Dwyer,Simple solution?
Andy Dwyer,"I already took what I call a ""dwyer shower."""
Andy Dwyer,"Sweet kick, Leslie exits the building, and then you get hit."
Andy Dwyer,What else do we know?
Andy Dwyer,"We know that Leslie was about 15 feet in front of you, so clearly the assailant has terrible aim."
Andy Dwyer,"She designed her own major, Halloween Studies."
Andy Dwyer,Or Leslie wasn't the target.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff."
Andy Dwyer,Ew.
Andy Dwyer,Is it like school?
Andy Dwyer,Does she get the summer off?
Andy Dwyer,"Now, let's talk perks."
Andy Dwyer,She'll take it.
Andy Dwyer,"This is the job for her, I can feel it."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, let's go to the video again."
Andy Dwyer,Holy crap.
Andy Dwyer,I break into her college and I change her degree to accounting.
Andy Dwyer,"On my way out, look up at the blackboard."
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,Bill Gates?
Andy Dwyer,"He lives in Seattle, guy with glasses."
Andy Dwyer,Have you ever heard of Bill Gates?
Andy Dwyer,Like Bill Gates.
Andy Dwyer,"People who give to charity, they get amazing press."
Andy Dwyer,"Sure, they did a good job, but this isn't enough."
Andy Dwyer,I've been thinking about it all day.
Andy Dwyer,And I have a plan to go the extra mile and make April seem like the ideal candidate.
Andy Dwyer,Give me the job!
Andy Dwyer,"My name's April Ludgate, and my talent is explosive."
Andy Dwyer,Go USA!
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,When should I tell April to show up?
Andy Dwyer,Don't do it.
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,"By the time he turns around, I'm gone."
Andy Dwyer,"""Why don't you accept this math trophy?"""
Andy Dwyer,"Professor comes up to me, he says, ""I've been working on that for 50 years."""
Andy Dwyer,"X equals Y, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,I solve it.
Andy Dwyer,Impossible math equation?
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Because I don't think that they know.
Andy Dwyer,We're obviously very familiar with what consulting is.
Andy Dwyer,"And I mean, I'm still pretty bad at it."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, don't even think about kissing me."
Andy Dwyer,"Is it, like, hit man or astronauts?"
Andy Dwyer,What kind of a business is this?
Andy Dwyer,"So, if you're trying to tell me something, I do not know what it is because you won't call me back."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I'm just now getting really good at shoe shining."
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,April.
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no, no, no! Hey!"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"This is like the 200th message I've left you, without a response."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, where are you going?"
Andy Dwyer,It was crazy.
Andy Dwyer,"But here's... No, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,April.
Andy Dwyer,"But, like, two minutes ago, me and Ann did kiss."
Andy Dwyer,"I want to be totally honest with you, because I like you so much."
Andy Dwyer,"Here's just one thing, real quick."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Babe.
Andy Dwyer,You had a crush on me.
Andy Dwyer,You're a dick.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe grab some snacks.
Andy Dwyer,We'll just brainstorm.
Andy Dwyer,She kissed me.
Andy Dwyer,But why don't you go ahead and tell my friends here.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,"Don't be mad, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, and here's the thing, Barney."
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, man."
Andy Dwyer,Would you be one of my best men?
Andy Dwyer,"Go find Ben, get a list of everyone he's ever fired."
Andy Dwyer,My desk was right here.
Andy Dwyer,Sitting right on top of it this whole time.
Andy Dwyer,How much money is it?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,No key.
Andy Dwyer,"That's awesome, I was going to tell them that we Heard ya, bud!"
Andy Dwyer,Just a note and a movie ticket stub and four teeth.
Andy Dwyer,"She hid it too good, and she left a string of clues."
Andy Dwyer,The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's your middle name?"
Andy Dwyer,Girl talk.
Andy Dwyer,All we gotta do is train Champion to sniff out Ron's key.
Andy Dwyer,All we need is Ron's key to give him a scent.
Andy Dwyer,So give me the key and I'll get you that key.
Andy Dwyer,"Go, go! Macklin, you son of a bitch."
Andy Dwyer,Debt and everything?
Andy Dwyer,"April, hey, it's me, Andy Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,Destroy my credit cards.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible to read.
Andy Dwyer,Where'd you put it then?
Andy Dwyer,I'm on the Frisbee Champs.
Andy Dwyer,Just for the kids.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we should do it for the kids."
Andy Dwyer,Because you're 21 and I'm 29?
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,"Copy of our new hit single, 5,000 Candles in the Wind, and the new full-length CD, The Awesome Album."
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Psych.
Andy Dwyer,Leave a message after the beep.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, is that you?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about what you said."
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna do my dreams, but I just don't think my dream is working for a company that puts logos on stuff."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh! Baby, I'm back."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, because of what you said."
Andy Dwyer,It's my only option.
Andy Dwyer,We're getting back together.
Andy Dwyer,You should've heard the super sexy stuff she was saying to me.
Andy Dwyer,That's not how you said it.
Andy Dwyer,"You were like, ""Hey, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer,"""It's Ann."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Can you talk at my house?"""
Andy Dwyer,House.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Dennis, what a mess."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, crap."
Andy Dwyer,"If you're Caleb, where's Hunter? Hunter! Hunter! Okay, who was Hunter's buddy? Hmm? Oh, I was."
Andy Dwyer,You're Caleb.
Andy Dwyer,You're Gavin.
Andy Dwyer,"No, do not laugh, okay? You're not even Caleb."
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, we are."
Andy Dwyer,Why do we even have a buddy system? Is he in the bathroom? You need to tell me if Gavin is pooping.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that seems about accurate."
Andy Dwyer,"I'll object to everything anyone says, trial will go on forever, you don't have to pay."
Andy Dwyer,"Great job, guys."
Andy Dwyer,"Really, I don't."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ted."
Andy Dwyer,Great job today.
Andy Dwyer,"You were so funny when you were like, ""My cell phone, I left it in my pocket."""
Andy Dwyer,"Then you checked it, remember, and it didn't work."
Andy Dwyer,Ha!
Andy Dwyer,Classic Ted.
Andy Dwyer,But I don't.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I don't."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, hey, let me be your lawyer."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, Eric."
Andy Dwyer,Taking a rest?
Andy Dwyer,Smart.
Andy Dwyer,"April Ludgate, would you be my manager?"
Andy Dwyer,"No, this is way more important than that."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Aw!
Andy Dwyer,"April, I need to ask you something, and it's the biggest thing I've ever asked anybody in my entire life."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Scott."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, you are awesome at this."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Problem solved.
Andy Dwyer,"Taking a rest, or are you hurt?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Where's Gavin? Gavin? Who was Gavin's buddy? Caleb, come on, dude."
Andy Dwyer,"Go! Wait, where's-- Hey, guys, where's Gavin? Gav? Wait, stop."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"The video shows that the pie came from a high angle, so it would've hit your face like this."
Andy Dwyer,Let's go over this again.
Andy Dwyer,"So, then perhaps, shall we go out this evening?"
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,There's got to be something we missed.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so close to putting it together.
Andy Dwyer,"We get that, so You just say the word, and Champion goes back to the pound, where he can be put down and killed forever."
Andy Dwyer,You want to be involved.
Andy Dwyer,I've been staring at this board for days.
Andy Dwyer,Kaboom.
Andy Dwyer,"One, I want that pit filled in, sir."
Andy Dwyer,I have my conditions.
Andy Dwyer,"A guaranteed starting spot in the Indianapolis Colts, inside linebacker."
Andy Dwyer,I've already been injured in that thing twice.
Andy Dwyer,"And I could fall in 10 more times by ""eventually."""
Andy Dwyer,"Every time I walk past that pit, I'm forced to relive the most traumatic two separate days of my life, and wanna sue you again."
Andy Dwyer,Do you like me?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,You always hated this pit!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we nailed it!"
Andy Dwyer,Damn straight.
Andy Dwyer,"She's like, ""Fine."
Andy Dwyer,"In a, you know, romantical kind of way."
Andy Dwyer,"And she was like ""Fine."""
Andy Dwyer,I like you.
Andy Dwyer,"""Eventually""?"
Andy Dwyer,There were supposed to be six ninjas.
Andy Dwyer,Don't close your eyes.
Andy Dwyer,It was actually from up higher.
Andy Dwyer,"And like that, they were gone."
Andy Dwyer,"One way or another, Jonathan Karate always gets his man."
Andy Dwyer,We did.
Andy Dwyer,None of your clothes fit me.
Andy Dwyer,So I'm putting an apron over the front stuff.
Andy Dwyer,Is she gone?
Andy Dwyer,See you back at the house.
Andy Dwyer,I've got a meeting as well.
Andy Dwyer,I'll catch you guys later.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm completely broke, and my lawyer said it could be worth upwards of 100,000 dollars."
Andy Dwyer,"No, you're right."
Andy Dwyer,Probably a condo.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh No, no."
Andy Dwyer,"I want Ann back, and she said she really needs a guy with a lot of money."
Andy Dwyer,I put two and two together.
Andy Dwyer,"100,000 dollars, I could probably get a bank account."
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,I'll get a job.
Andy Dwyer,Ann will respect that.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this again.
Andy Dwyer,Clean yourself up.
Andy Dwyer,"Terminator said, ""I'll be back,"" and he was."
Andy Dwyer,Good.
Andy Dwyer,I can make six bucks a day playing guitar on the street.
Andy Dwyer,Is that about right?
Andy Dwyer,I can't make six bucks a day.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I can't really do her voice, but she said she likes Mark because he's a grown-up with a bank account."
Andy Dwyer,"Kids love it, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,If the if the guy if Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I don't get it.
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,I love to volunteer.
Andy Dwyer,The key to volunteering?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, dude, totally."
Andy Dwyer,A lot of pockets.
Andy Dwyer,He'll come back.
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,For putting all the food in.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,The Red Cross has amazing cookies.
Andy Dwyer,I go there all the time.
Andy Dwyer,Meals On Wheels was a bonanza.
Andy Dwyer,My best man.
Andy Dwyer,"Suicide Hotline, surprisingly lame spread."
Andy Dwyer,Not anymore.
Andy Dwyer,Living with the drummer of my band.
Andy Dwyer,"Living indoors, pretty cool, not to brag."
Andy Dwyer,Kind of hard not to.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyhow, got to go, me and an old Asian lady are double-teaming some monkey bars."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's karaoke tonight!"
Andy Dwyer,"Here, try some."
Andy Dwyer,Wisdom.
Andy Dwyer,"I know, right?"
Andy Dwyer,So much to learn.
Andy Dwyer,They are so young.
Andy Dwyer,I thought I'd give back to those less fortunate than myself.
Andy Dwyer,Truth bomb.
Andy Dwyer,He'll be all right.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Ha ha!
Andy Dwyer,"We had to ""Jetsons"" most of the poster too, but I kind of like it, 'cause windows are the eyes to the house."
Andy Dwyer,"Mr. Dennis Feinstein, let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad."
Andy Dwyer,"I just started working here, and I really want to do a good job, and I blew it."
Andy Dwyer,"No, leashes are just for dogs that bite people."
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, Champion's my dog, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"I'd say my coaching style is centered around fundamentals, with an emphasis on fun."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, watch this."
Andy Dwyer,Why did you make me - apologize to him?
Andy Dwyer,Hi.
Andy Dwyer,Go get it.
Andy Dwyer,Sometimes you just have to let a dog be a dog.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,- Crossbow? What the--
Andy Dwyer,And a second emphasis on mental.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it can be hard work."
Andy Dwyer,But every time I look one of these kids in the eyes and he calls me Coach... That's how I know I agreed to be a coach.
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat!
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat!
Andy Dwyer,Ann.
Andy Dwyer,He's not going anywhere.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,I'm volunteering.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Go, Lightning."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,What does he have that I don't have?
Andy Dwyer,It just happens.
Andy Dwyer,"Case in point, sometimes when I blow my nose, I get a boner."
Andy Dwyer,"Then I laid down on this really comfy tarp, I saw an old cereal box I hadn't read before, so I must have drifted off."
Andy Dwyer,Next thing you know... Dirt.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,That is perfect.
Andy Dwyer,It's like I'm lying in a cloud.
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann and Andy, just like old times."
Andy Dwyer,The pit works in mysterious ways.
Andy Dwyer,"Defendant, alias Ron Swanson, alias my boss, used appropriate force to prevent further damage to the wedding of Leslie Knope, alias my other boss."
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like there should be a term for that, like Nicey meany."
Andy Dwyer,The words that they say sound passive but seem aggressive.
Andy Dwyer,I just had to go back because I forgot my headphones.
Andy Dwyer,The Meagles are weird.
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, it happened a really long time ago, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,My sexy sweater.
Andy Dwyer,It has a hole cut out over the bicep.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"No, A-Cakes, seriously, thank you."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"A tragic accident reignited feelings you thought were long dead, and we are finally back together."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,Is that still happening?
Andy Dwyer,And it was probably an accident.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know why.
Andy Dwyer,I moved out of the pit.
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,I love telling the truth.
Andy Dwyer,That's right.
Andy Dwyer,He's even a better kisser than me.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, he is."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Champion is a way better kisser than you are, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Don't cry, Ginuwine, it's okay."
Andy Dwyer,She doesn't mean it.
Andy Dwyer,"Here are all the troublemakers, boss."
Andy Dwyer,The Russians?
Andy Dwyer,"Next witness, your honor."
Andy Dwyer,"Just to be safe, I wouldn't take anything I say too seriously."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I pooched the brain exam."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I told you."
Andy Dwyer,Don't know.
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!
Andy Dwyer,What the [bleep].
Andy Dwyer,I'm okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,"In fact, at the time, I was trying to become a police officer but was deemed unfit for the force."
Andy Dwyer,What do we do now? Can I apologize again? I'm getting really at apologizing.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that beeping was sure annoying."
Andy Dwyer,But this is even more annoying.
Andy Dwyer,He called it.
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's Champion's spot."
Andy Dwyer,Anything is a toy if you play with it.
Andy Dwyer,Who?
Andy Dwyer,That guy? Do you even know him?
Andy Dwyer,Remember when we did both at the same time?
Andy Dwyer,It made him so uncomfortable.
Andy Dwyer,""" By the looks of this guy, this is not consensual sex we're talking about."
Andy Dwyer,"And he says, ""I used to [Bleep] guys like you in prison."
Andy Dwyer,The guy has Swayze's head.
Andy Dwyer,There's a mall?
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I need to get some flipflops.
Andy Dwyer,I do love you.
Andy Dwyer,Sha!
Andy Dwyer,I think based on the redness I might be allergic to getting stabbed by needles.
Andy Dwyer,Have you ever seen any of the National Treasure movies?
Andy Dwyer,Everything in this city is a clue.
Andy Dwyer,Aha!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, awesome."
Andy Dwyer,A clue!
Andy Dwyer,How do I know this isn't a treasure map just waiting to be unfurled?
Andy Dwyer,"Swayze ducks, scissor kick."
Andy Dwyer,That's gum.
Andy Dwyer,""" Comes at him."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, this is a really cool penis, but Ben and April are meeting us at the Smithsonian in 10 minutes."
Andy Dwyer,Which nation?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,"Dude's like, ""you're dead, bro!"
Andy Dwyer,We are going to Chicago.
Andy Dwyer,And we have to catch it.
Andy Dwyer,It's a sign!
Andy Dwyer,We've been sitting here searching for your soul mate this whole time and then Lucy just Gryzzl-texts you out of nowhere?
Andy Dwyer,Check it out.
Andy Dwyer,Do you realize what's happening?
Andy Dwyer,We see bad guy had a gun the whole time.
Andy Dwyer,""" Swayze's like, ""not this time."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Head coach of the Chicago Bulls.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, I have been trying really hard not to bother you."
Andy Dwyer,"Like, when you had that barbecue last week, I didn't come up, even though it smelled so good."
Andy Dwyer,"And then when you hit him up on Gryzzl, he was like, ""Let's go say hi to Lucy since we're already here in Chicago."""
Andy Dwyer,I just got a job here.
Andy Dwyer,He's here helping me find a place to live.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"Andy Dwyer, remember me?"
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Um Lucy.
Andy Dwyer,One week only.
Andy Dwyer,"He's like, ""I'ma kill you the oldfashioned way."
Andy Dwyer,Listen.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that's cool."
Andy Dwyer,"I got to zoom out, too, 'cause I have some people coming over."
Andy Dwyer,"Tom, we should at least say hi."
Andy Dwyer,We came all this way.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"So, why don't you call first next time?"
Andy Dwyer,You know the way out.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah?
Andy Dwyer,The big apple.
Andy Dwyer,Chicago!
Andy Dwyer,Pay the man.
Andy Dwyer,Are we gonna talk about anything other than the lies that I told you?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Was she in Destiny's Child?
Andy Dwyer,She looks familiar.
Andy Dwyer,Don't let me interrupt your date.
Andy Dwyer,I already ate.
Andy Dwyer,Everything here is free.
Andy Dwyer,Let's get hammered.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I got a quick fix for that."
Andy Dwyer,"Are you bummed, Tom?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm super full.
Andy Dwyer,I don't I don't want any.
Andy Dwyer,On the house!
Andy Dwyer,And a spaghetti to go.
Andy Dwyer,Let me also get a chicken parm and a lasagna on the side.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's all right."
Andy Dwyer,Greg Pikitis?
Andy Dwyer,Tom.
Andy Dwyer,"""Entrepreneur bachelor, Tom Haverford, is making quite a splash in the culinary world, and we expect even bigger things from him in 2018."""
Andy Dwyer,Would you like some boiling hot coffee in your face?
Andy Dwyer,My name is Bert Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,I'm with the [bleep] FBI.
Andy Dwyer,They took my blood away to use for science.
Andy Dwyer,Champion.
Andy Dwyer,April had her sinuses removed?
Andy Dwyer,"Some guy looked at my wiener, touched it."
Andy Dwyer,That was weird.
Andy Dwyer,That What?
Andy Dwyer,You drink all the time.
Andy Dwyer,What does culinary mean?
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's not it."
Andy Dwyer,"In order to think like one of these guys, you have to think like them."
Andy Dwyer,That's cool.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look, you got a message from somebody named Lucy in Chicago."
Andy Dwyer,Why are you only friends with your family?
Andy Dwyer,"I'm drunk, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,How about her?
Andy Dwyer,Tackles the guy off the motorcycle.
Andy Dwyer,Date her.
Andy Dwyer,She's cute.
Andy Dwyer,What about her?
Andy Dwyer,Let's open your Gryzzl page.
Andy Dwyer,What if your future wife is somebody that you already know?
Andy Dwyer,"So Swayze runs, boom!"
Andy Dwyer,I need to get a picture of me holding this so I can frame it.
Andy Dwyer,"Why don't you let me take a run at him, boss?"
Andy Dwyer,Over 100 copies sold in Pawnee!
Andy Dwyer,Can I go first?
Andy Dwyer,"Is Mark the guy who's ""fixing your shower""?"
Andy Dwyer,"We have already been to, like, five different doctors."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I'm here."
Andy Dwyer,Statue's fine.
Andy Dwyer,"""Crappy Hallowieners."""
Andy Dwyer,That's hilarious.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know about you, Mark, but I've seen a ton of porn."
Andy Dwyer,Where's the kid?
Andy Dwyer,"And I know what ""fixing your shower"" means."
Andy Dwyer,I got my ankles microwaved.
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, you guys are on a date."
Andy Dwyer,"Mouse Rat, certified gold!"
Andy Dwyer,You're on the pill.
Andy Dwyer,Am I?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, wow!"
Andy Dwyer,All set.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, babe, for this picture, should I be Burt Macklin, Johnny Karate, or my new character, Sergeant Thunderfist, M.D.?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, this is why they call it Beantown, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,Can you help me?
Andy Dwyer,Found it in the sandbox.
Andy Dwyer,I can't get it off.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,He was probably thinking with the head of his wiener instead of the head of his brain.
Andy Dwyer,Men are dogs.
Andy Dwyer,I'm moving to Chicago!
Andy Dwyer,"Look at me, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,You look amazing.
Andy Dwyer,Life is about taking risks.
Andy Dwyer,"And I love that she's buying us stuff! Dude, make your move."
Andy Dwyer,You had some right here.
Andy Dwyer,"Correction, darling."
Andy Dwyer,You remember that?
Andy Dwyer,I called that.
Andy Dwyer,Called it.
Andy Dwyer,Who had sex?
Andy Dwyer,He looks like Ron Swanson.
Andy Dwyer,Is that who this is based on?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Merkel.
Andy Dwyer,A week ago I had nothing.
Andy Dwyer,Ask her out.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie, I have an idea."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God!"
Andy Dwyer,I'm not supposed to see you before the wedding.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, seriously, I cannot emphasize how little we thought about this."
Andy Dwyer,"Am I right? All right, well, this is a song I wrote for you, April Roberta Ludgate."
Andy Dwyer,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, yeah Oh, Grandma April, there's so little time The things I really want to do Let's fly to the sky It's so awesome"
Andy Dwyer,I bet he didn't use a condom.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm just gonna cover my eyes, just to be safe."
Andy Dwyer,It's disgusting.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I saw him too."
Andy Dwyer,I ruined it!
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, April."
Andy Dwyer,"It's me, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Just stay sleeping.
Andy Dwyer,Men do that.
Andy Dwyer,I am going to be here when you wake up.
Andy Dwyer,You could be asleep for hours.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe I'll come back later.
Andy Dwyer,Hope you feel better.
Andy Dwyer,That's so good!
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"And I know you think that I'm a jerk, but I hope you can forgive me."
Andy Dwyer,Gross.
Andy Dwyer,Your forehead is all sweaty.
Andy Dwyer,That's gross.
Andy Dwyer,But I still like you.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,That's disgusting.
Andy Dwyer,I will not leave your side.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that sucks."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't we put Eduardo in there and seal the top so that he suffocates and dies?
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna make 32 bucks tonight.
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Andy Dwyer,"Bypasses the gun, hooks the arm."
Andy Dwyer,He doesn't say that.
Andy Dwyer,""" That's subtext."
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"Great win, great night."
Andy Dwyer,Great year.
Andy Dwyer,Hot wife.
Andy Dwyer,Jackpot.
Andy Dwyer,"Good job, me."
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Mm-hmm.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,That building looks like a boob.
Andy Dwyer,I hope we didn't wake you up.
Andy Dwyer,"Miss Beavers, this is official police business."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, I know."
Andy Dwyer,It's the White House.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"She's got a point, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I didn't bring a guidebook."
Andy Dwyer,You did?
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,You ready to go?
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I have a part-time job."
Andy Dwyer,Ann!
Andy Dwyer,But this time he has to do it because it's selfdefense.
Andy Dwyer,I owe Leslie everything I have.
Andy Dwyer,"Which, after tonight, will be 39 bucks."
Andy Dwyer,Toxic.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, anybody can do that."
Andy Dwyer,"We love you, Grandma!"
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, whatever."
Andy Dwyer,Cool!
Andy Dwyer,Am I making the right decision?
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to do.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, you got me really missing Pawnee now."
Andy Dwyer,My wife's there for cryin' out loud.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I am gonna miss Pawnee, though."
Andy Dwyer,"Back to the secret move he used before to kill somebody, he feels so bad about it."
Andy Dwyer,It seems really nice.
Andy Dwyer,You have got an amazing house and a really cool nightgown and seem to be super good at dating.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank you so much!"
Andy Dwyer,I think you know them?
Andy Dwyer,It's for Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt.
Andy Dwyer,It'd really mean a lot if you sign it.
Andy Dwyer,"Aww, is that your husband?"
Andy Dwyer,What should I do next?
Andy Dwyer,And that is Road House.
Andy Dwyer,You'll starve to death.
Andy Dwyer,You can't eat.
Andy Dwyer,Takes the esophagus out of the neck area.
Andy Dwyer,Kkkkah!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,So we didn't overthink it.
Andy Dwyer,Like you're perfect.
Andy Dwyer,It's hot sauce.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get up there.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get naked.
Andy Dwyer,That guy's my wife.
Andy Dwyer,I got a guy that works at City Hall.
Andy Dwyer,I'll streak across the stage.
Andy Dwyer,That's it.
Andy Dwyer,Butts.
Andy Dwyer,And I can do the license.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"Meanwhile, you and I are already on a boat to the airport."
Andy Dwyer,Everybody's fancy jewelry is missing.
Andy Dwyer,"We shut off the lights, turn 'em back on."
Andy Dwyer,Everyone is gonna see my wiener.
Andy Dwyer,How about this?
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it.
Andy Dwyer,"You just grab the toilet paper, unroll it a little bit like this, and throw it on the tree."
Andy Dwyer,Turns out they were right and wrong.
Andy Dwyer,"Macklin, you son of a bitch."
Andy Dwyer,Five-O! Five-O!
Andy Dwyer,"I see you in there, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Leslie? What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,"Attention, everybody!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hello Ann."
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, there's something I have to tell you."
Andy Dwyer,Me?
Andy Dwyer,Maybe.
Andy Dwyer,Just observing.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, you've seen it."
Andy Dwyer,Perfect plan.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I mean that in a good way."
Andy Dwyer,Look at you now.
Andy Dwyer,"Go, go, go!"
Andy Dwyer,You're the coolest person I've ever met.
Andy Dwyer,I even met John Cougar Mellencamp once.
Andy Dwyer,No way.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, you got me a job and you're helping me turn my life around."
Andy Dwyer,I go home when you go home.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna divorce you.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"Good morning, colleagues, coworkers, friends."
Andy Dwyer,Everyone feeling normal today?
Andy Dwyer,You know how dumb it looks.
Andy Dwyer,Here's what happened.
Andy Dwyer,"When I went back to get it, I found this in the trash: Positive pregnancy test."
Andy Dwyer,Side note: I accidentally threw my sweat shirt away.
Andy Dwyer,That's why I was digging through the trash.
Andy Dwyer,Found that too.
Andy Dwyer,Pretty cool.
Andy Dwyer,"So if my science is correct, one of the five women who were at the cabin Leslie, Donna, Ann, MonaLisa, or April is pregnant!"
Andy Dwyer,Can't be April.
Andy Dwyer,She would've told me.
Andy Dwyer,That leaves four suspects.
Andy Dwyer,"There's only one man for this job: Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,They said I was retired.
Andy Dwyer,They said I was too dangerous for the Pawnee Police Department.
Andy Dwyer,I left my sweat shirt at Ron's cabin.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but you were probably a nerd, though, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,A little something they taught us down at Quantico.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I guess I'll get out of your hair."
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, I don't think so."
Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin works alone.
Andy Dwyer,Welcome to the FBI.
Andy Dwyer,This whole place is your office.
Andy Dwyer,"Just this one, and all the ones in those boxes."
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Andy Dwyer,"The point is, I'm a terrible dog owner."
Andy Dwyer,"Tonight, at the gala, we are gonna do something spontaneous and weird."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna prove it to you.
Andy Dwyer,We are still fun!
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,Look at this.
Andy Dwyer,I won.
Andy Dwyer,The new Jason Bourne movie is supposed to be pretty funny.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know, Sunday, we can go to the farmer's market, put the brisket in the slow cooker, get a movie on Pay Per View."
Andy Dwyer,I think we've got dinner with Joe and Donna on Friday.
Andy Dwyer,I have production meetings all day.
Andy Dwyer,Thursday's no good.
Andy Dwyer,You heard the boss.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Park we will build it, the park it's not built yet, the park soon there will be a park"
Andy Dwyer,"And I think, if we find Champion, you should keep him."
Andy Dwyer,Let's get you home and get me some ice cream.
Andy Dwyer,"Scram, Wyatt."
Andy Dwyer,"If I had my gun, you wouldn't try to hit me, though, is the thing."
Andy Dwyer,Boom.
Andy Dwyer,I ate one of your soy bones.
Andy Dwyer,"I was gonna give it to Champion, but it just it looked so yummy."
Andy Dwyer,This is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, there is just one more question."
Andy Dwyer,Congratulations.
Andy Dwyer,"It's an accusation, 'cause I know your secret."
Andy Dwyer,You're pregnant.
Andy Dwyer,Should I still take the Zantac?
Andy Dwyer,Dude.
Andy Dwyer,That kid is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,All that salt will give me heartburn.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna take a Zantac.
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Andy Dwyer,What do you wanna do first?
Andy Dwyer,This is gonna be fun.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it was really good."
Andy Dwyer,64
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that?
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that pop?
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,He's only 64?
Andy Dwyer,"I'm so crazy and spontaneous, I don't even need this sling anymore."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check it out."
Andy Dwyer,You're not?
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,Who is?
Andy Dwyer,'Cause I found this at Ron Swanson's cabin.
Andy Dwyer,It's a pregnancy test.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm not even in the FBI, stupid."
Andy Dwyer,You wanna do shots?
Andy Dwyer,I was probably not thinking 'cause I had two broken femurs and I was blackout drunk.
Andy Dwyer,"They're still gonna serve that cake, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, okay."
Andy Dwyer,He's a jerk.
Andy Dwyer,"Just don't worry about me, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,Okay? I'll be fine.
Andy Dwyer,How's it going?
Andy Dwyer,"Buddy, good to see you."
Andy Dwyer,"That went really well! We had dinner! I got to see her! Oh, God, I was so tempted to look back at her."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Tom!"
Andy Dwyer,Because we're at war.
Andy Dwyer,And I ate a lot of 'em on the way over here.
Andy Dwyer,Was she looking? I had to walk so slow.
Andy Dwyer,A good day.
Andy Dwyer,He's being such a jerk.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,That's an awful thing to say to a human being!
Andy Dwyer,"No, I am not crying, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm allergic to jerks!
Andy Dwyer,"But now she's gone and gotten herself a Venezuelan boyfriend who's, like, the handsomest dude I've ever seen."
Andy Dwyer,"Fine, and I don't even care!"
Andy Dwyer,Present company excluded.
Andy Dwyer,It's stupid--
Andy Dwyer,You knew that.
Andy Dwyer,I was talking about me.
Andy Dwyer,Totally.
Andy Dwyer,Who needs rental insurance? We're gonna live here.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"So basically, Ann kissed me and then April kissed me, and I told April, because of honesty is important."
Andy Dwyer,And we are going to buy the [bleep] out of this house!
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Andy Dwyer,Ann is an extraordinary cook.
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,Memories.
Andy Dwyer,"You know what's funny? I was just sitting over here on the couch and I was thinking, that there was once a time when Mark used to be the stranger in the house."
Andy Dwyer,And now it's me.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Everybody move!
Andy Dwyer,"Move, move, move!"
Andy Dwyer,This entire event is under federal jurisdiction.
Andy Dwyer,Shut up!
Andy Dwyer,"I should point out that you said ""duty"" twice."
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Unless he's in trouble, there's only one man for the job."
Andy Dwyer,You thought I was dead?
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you just shut up for a second?
Andy Dwyer,So did the president's enemies.
Andy Dwyer,"As usual, Ann, a delicious meal."
Andy Dwyer,Are we doing anything in the way of dessert or coffee?
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I get it."
Andy Dwyer,Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer,Don't be late.
Andy Dwyer,"Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot."
Andy Dwyer,"I know you're in a rush, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I'm very good at picking up signals.
Andy Dwyer,"Let's go, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,Everybody does stupid stuff like this in high school.
Andy Dwyer,We have money.
Andy Dwyer,We are responsible adults.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, a hero with something to hide, like probably a treasure map."
Andy Dwyer,Let's roll.
Andy Dwyer,How you guys doing?
Andy Dwyer,"Good call, babe."
Andy Dwyer,Where are we? I have never once been to this part of Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,"Would boring people get renters insurance, even though it's not legally required?"
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, we are not boring people."
Andy Dwyer,It is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,We're at Burly's family vacation house on Lake Michigan.
Andy Dwyer,The President of the United States of America.
Andy Dwyer,"And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things, dinner and parties."
Andy Dwyer,"We were thinking about maybe just uh, we maybe we were gonna go back to"
Andy Dwyer,I'm good!
Andy Dwyer,We're having so much fun.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it was bad FBI work, too."
Andy Dwyer,My bad.
Andy Dwyer,Get it out of my system.
Andy Dwyer,Give it to him.
Andy Dwyer,I guess I better commit as many crimes as possible tonight.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, it's pretty crazy, I'm gonna be a cop tomorrow."
Andy Dwyer,"You are all officially invited to a dinner party, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home."
Andy Dwyer,"This crowd getting very hostile, Ms. Knope."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get you outta here.
Andy Dwyer,So bad.
Andy Dwyer,Kids are kids.
Andy Dwyer,Back off!
Andy Dwyer,"Except for Roberta, here, turns out, sucks at water skiing."
Andy Dwyer,You know what that means?
Andy Dwyer,I think it is.
Andy Dwyer,Is this the train from Back to the Future 3?
Andy Dwyer,I was pretty wasted.
Andy Dwyer,Fire pole!
Andy Dwyer,What's behind this door?
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,What was this place?
Andy Dwyer,That's true.
Andy Dwyer,And I fell in and broke my legs.
Andy Dwyer,"And I was like, ""Maybe I should get that."""
Andy Dwyer,It's a fairly standard layout.
Andy Dwyer,"It says here there are 12 closets, three bomb shelters, five dumbwaiters, two and three-eighths baths, no kitchens."
Andy Dwyer,He didn't-- He didn't pay me.
Andy Dwyer,He just sat down.
Andy Dwyer,Get down from there.
Andy Dwyer,What am I supposed to do?
Andy Dwyer,He isn't?
Andy Dwyer,Marriage license done.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, we got it!"
Andy Dwyer,God dang it.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot figure out who my boss is.
Andy Dwyer,"And I was taking a shortcut home, and I thought I saw a toaster lying in the pit."
Andy Dwyer,"I just finished up a gig with my band Three Skin, formerly Four Skin, but our bassist left for personal reasons."
Andy Dwyer,That's actually a great story.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,He's my boss.
Andy Dwyer,Try to hit me.
Andy Dwyer,We are in love.
Andy Dwyer,"What happened? But, seriously, life is short, right? Uh, just I really think you should just do whatever makes you happy."
Andy Dwyer,You guys are the best.
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,Pierre Garcon was a sixthround pick.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, but that's not what's wrong."
Andy Dwyer,It's just... Seeing all those kids out there... Babe.
Andy Dwyer,"I want to put a babe in you, babe."
Andy Dwyer,Indianapolis Colts know how to draft so well.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"It's awesome, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,They wipe all of the disgusting stuff off of it immediately.
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say we go out to the parking lot, run a few pass plays to burn off the calories?"
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I love this.
Andy Dwyer,Who's Sandra Day O'Connor?
Andy Dwyer,I want to say hi and wrestle all three of them at once.
Andy Dwyer,So?
Andy Dwyer,What do you need a hand with?
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, that's really slick."
Andy Dwyer,"Man, that's some secret agent stuff right there."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, and I'm freaking out, man."
Andy Dwyer,Peyton Manning reading the defense!
Andy Dwyer,"Reggie Wayne, Colts corner!"
Andy Dwyer,I want kids so bad.
Andy Dwyer,"You know, yesterday, I was at the park, and I saw this group of eight year olds laughing and playing and having a good time."
Andy Dwyer,"Can I get two beers and an ice water for my friend here, designated driver?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, where are the kids at?"
Andy Dwyer,I almost started crying.
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, you little monsters!"
Andy Dwyer,They're here.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Taylor, do you want to marry me and April?"
Andy Dwyer,"It's a little hot in here, a little sweaty."
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun!
Andy Dwyer,"I'm gonna head out to, uh, the car."
Andy Dwyer,I get to push buttons.
Andy Dwyer,I called it.
Andy Dwyer,You know what I'm gonna do?
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I'm happy for them.
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's totally fine."
Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to miss the food in Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look at them!"
Andy Dwyer,"Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut."
Andy Dwyer,That is a beautiful sentiment.
Andy Dwyer,That's what they all say.
Andy Dwyer,What the... No!
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Andy Dwyer,Sometimes I play with it and eat it.
Andy Dwyer,Classic new guy.
Andy Dwyer,"I play with it, I eat it."
Andy Dwyer,That sapphire has the power to activate the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Andy Dwyer,I know a lot about candy.
Andy Dwyer,"Look, it's really easy."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Raincheck that, all right?"
Andy Dwyer,"But most of all, I'm going to miss you, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Anybody would be lucky to marry him.
Andy Dwyer,"Granted, I had just faceplanted on my rollerblades."
Andy Dwyer,I already ordered the water.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,Uh-oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Is that true?
Andy Dwyer,That's not-- What?
Andy Dwyer,"If you see her, will you tell her I really need to talk to her?"
Andy Dwyer,Land mines blowing them up into pieces.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, so I've been trying like crazy to get a hold of April."
Andy Dwyer,"It's, like, one of the highest you can get."
Andy Dwyer,Paying 12% interest.
Andy Dwyer,Got a really good deal on my lease.
Andy Dwyer,That was beautiful.
Andy Dwyer,"But due to, you know, never having a job, I couldn't afford it until now."
Andy Dwyer,Open on villagers being thrown out into a rice field.
Andy Dwyer,I've always wanted one of these.
Andy Dwyer,I just got this super sweet-ass rad crotch rocket.
Andy Dwyer,That is really bad timing.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,How long is it going to last?
Andy Dwyer,Where is everyone?
Andy Dwyer,It's quiet in here.
Andy Dwyer,Ron!
Andy Dwyer,"You guys, uh, know anything about a guy named John Rambo?"
Andy Dwyer,"Redwood Music Program go, your honor, amen."
Andy Dwyer,"In conclusion, we cannot let our children live in the sewer any longer."
Andy Dwyer,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Nah, it's too late, bro."
Andy Dwyer,Just put them over there.
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what you want me to do.
Andy Dwyer,That's what they were laughing at.
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, the band is moving me tonight."
Andy Dwyer,It's really good.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you know what, Mouse Rat has a lot of influence on some of the local high school bands, mostly 'cause Chang buys 'em beer and whatnot."
Andy Dwyer,That's my band.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't recognize us without me because I'm the only one that matters.
Andy Dwyer,Rat Mouse?
Andy Dwyer,Rat bastards.
Andy Dwyer,They're playing without me?
Andy Dwyer,That's a song I wrote!
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, you look more beautiful right now than I have ever seen you."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, for the baby?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, hello, Burly, Chang."
Andy Dwyer,A band.
Andy Dwyer,"But you're missing something like, uh, I don't know, your lead singer songwriter Tshirt designer nacho chef."
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I dropped my cell phone in a bowl of cereal last week, you idiot."
Andy Dwyer,"You bothered to call me, you'd have known that."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe you should change your name to Burly and The Backstabbers.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Burt Macklin Junior?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I like that."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Or maybe, Burt Snakehole Ludgate Karate Dracula Macklin Demon Jacko'Lantern Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,We call him Jack for short.
Andy Dwyer,"I was just over at the bar, enjoying a wonderful night with my coworkers who all talked about how awesome I was, and I look up, and what do I see?"
Andy Dwyer,I was there all day.
Andy Dwyer,Just fix me.
Andy Dwyer,And that's how it ends.
Andy Dwyer,Woo-hoo! Knope 2012! Hyah! Hyah! Ron!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah! Play it.
Andy Dwyer,Ron Swanson's office.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I will transfer you."
Andy Dwyer,I just dropped another call.
Andy Dwyer,"Good morning, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Please hurry.
Andy Dwyer,"One, three, seven, two, five, nine."
Andy Dwyer,Pffft!
Andy Dwyer,Sudoku is easy.
Andy Dwyer,Is there even rules to this game?
Andy Dwyer,I told her it's a matter of life and death.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, honey, I'm ink Dracula."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, Donna's been here forever."
Andy Dwyer,Squid Dracula is going to get you.

Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,This is what Li'I Sebastian's gonna listen to in horsey heaven.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyhow Later days, dudes."
Andy Dwyer,That's how tight my pants are.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I'm like a giant squid."
Andy Dwyer,Didn't even smell it till just now.
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna spend the rest of my life, every minute, with you."
Andy Dwyer,I'm telling you.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I mean, 100 bucks a week, that's pretty fair."
Andy Dwyer,At the end I drive everybody home.
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, I act in it, I do sets, props, wardrobe."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but all I really do is goof around all day, write, produce and direct a TV show."
Andy Dwyer,"And I want to own the character Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me."
Andy Dwyer,"He wants me to sign it, but it says that they'll own the character Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,"It came from the station manager where I do my show, Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,It's a contract.
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know what, dude, you gotta take your mind off them."
Andy Dwyer,I named us.
Andy Dwyer,Why are you doing new dishes?
Andy Dwyer,Said it wrong.
Andy Dwyer,Really good.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, he is, uh, sitting right here in this courtyard."
Andy Dwyer,Mmmâ¦
Andy Dwyer,Then who is it?
Andy Dwyer,Also a man.
Andy Dwyer,Might I suggest Tom? He loves ideas.
Andy Dwyer,"""April, you're the most awesome person ""I have ever known in my entire life."
Andy Dwyer,Who cuts your hair?
Andy Dwyer,"""I vow to protect you from danger."""
Andy Dwyer,"""I don't care if I have to fight an ultimate fighter, or a bear, or him, your mom, I would take 'em down."""
Andy Dwyer,I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
Andy Dwyer,Filo pilos?
Andy Dwyer,That's not right.
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,I broke my thumb on the way over here.
Andy Dwyer,I farted five minutes ago.
Andy Dwyer,"You could help, like, a zillion more charities."
Andy Dwyer,They totally skimp on pickles.
Andy Dwyer,Let me go to Big Head Joe's for you.
Andy Dwyer,They have the most insane burritos.
Andy Dwyer,You should all see it.
Andy Dwyer,"No, trust me."
Andy Dwyer,"They have one that's called the ""Meat Tornado""."
Andy Dwyer,Move to a new city.
Andy Dwyer,"See you tomorrow, Jeremy."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, the cake."
Andy Dwyer,Filo Pilo ruined the cake.
Andy Dwyer,"Change our names, burn our fingertips off with acid, swap faces."
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Andy Dwyer,"Hear, hear."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, yeah, I've got a weird rash in my knee pit area."
Andy Dwyer,"And my tongue, on this side, doesn't taste anything anymore."
Andy Dwyer,It literally killed a guy last year.
Andy Dwyer,"Sometimes when I walk my ankles make, like, a weird rattlesnake sound."
Andy Dwyer,Things that are far away from my eyes are fuzzy.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,Talking pig.
Andy Dwyer,"I once at a twix with the wrapper on it, and I've never seen the wrapper come out."
Andy Dwyer,Also I've swallowed every piece of gum that I've chewed for the past 25 years.
Andy Dwyer,And I know it sounds corny.
Andy Dwyer,It's called Babe.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,I loved it.
Andy Dwyer,If we have to.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, let me tell you something else that's interesting, Ben."
Andy Dwyer,Don't go there.
Andy Dwyer,"I was reading an encyclopedia, and I tripped or ""fell over"" and hit my head or brain helmet."
Andy Dwyer,Am I right?
Andy Dwyer,Imagine all the money you could save if you didn't have to pay for this expensive stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"I'll tell you what, honey."
Andy Dwyer,"The music program would be effective, but the ambulance is gonna help people right now who are in trouble and will probably look good in the media."
Andy Dwyer,Here's the deal.
Andy Dwyer,There's a lot riding on this.
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, help me."
Andy Dwyer,I totally get it.
Andy Dwyer,That's why I'm telling them learn to fly.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Li'l horse, spread your wings and learn to fly."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I don't even want to talk to me."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,"In my heart, I'm sad you had to die."
Andy Dwyer,You wanted to talk to me?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben."
Andy Dwyer,"You get fired, I'll quit."
Andy Dwyer,We'll leave together.
Andy Dwyer,I'm serious.
Andy Dwyer,"""Anything is possible, if you follow your dreams."""
Andy Dwyer,Johnny Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Tim.
Andy Dwyer,Tim Buckenowski.
Andy Dwyer,It just came out.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,Or probably not.
Andy Dwyer,That's what April and I did.
Andy Dwyer,Example I fell in a sewer grate once.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I'm an adult now, you know?"
Andy Dwyer,"So dream jobs, go."
Andy Dwyer,"Dream big, kid!"
Andy Dwyer,That's brilliant.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"Mmm, it tastes like froot loops."
Andy Dwyer,I'm so hungry.
Andy Dwyer,It's from the movie Seabiscuit.
Andy Dwyer,"Because if you're playing horseshoes, and then you throw a grenade at a horse, it doesn't have to be that close, and you can still blow the horse's legs off."
Andy Dwyer,It's a saying.
Andy Dwyer,Close only counts in horse grenades.
Andy Dwyer,This story's terrible so far.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,"That book sounded so boring, I cried a little."
Andy Dwyer,"Just this once, I thought I nailed something."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, you're really screwing this up."
Andy Dwyer,"I just wanna thank my family, my friends, most importantly, my best best man, Mr. Tom Haverford."
Andy Dwyer,Thank God.
Andy Dwyer,"Burly, I just want to say I'm sorry that I haven't been to rehearsal and that I won't let you sing or write songs or walk out onstage in front of me."
Andy Dwyer,"Man, I love playing with you guys."
Andy Dwyer,And I want back in if you'll let me.
Andy Dwyer,Oh! Coolest guy I know.
Andy Dwyer,But I like to think that it applies to life.
Andy Dwyer,I read that once on a can of lemonade.
Andy Dwyer,Pass.
Andy Dwyer,"And my band is so good, and are you gonna eat that pecan square? When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."
Andy Dwyer,Trampoline.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gone for one day and this entire shoe shine stand falls apart.
Andy Dwyer,"Now I got a job, and a kickass wife."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"You will certainly get fired, and I'm trying to help."
Andy Dwyer,I forgot it.
Andy Dwyer,"No, business is my life now."
Andy Dwyer,William Henry Harrison's wig.
Andy Dwyer,Historical artifact!
Andy Dwyer,I found an artifact!
Andy Dwyer,"See you later, kid."
Andy Dwyer,No problem.
Andy Dwyer,Huh? Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,"When I come back here in a few weeks, I don't want all my regular customers to not be here waiting for me because somebody screwed it up."
Andy Dwyer,How old?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,I am.
Andy Dwyer,"And I was just explaining to April that I'm a failure, and she should leave me for Orin."
Andy Dwyer,Is it?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,It's fun.

Andy Dwyer,"So, Leslie, this song, which is for Li'l Sebastian, is for you."
Andy Dwyer,"If it weren't for Leslie Knope, none of us would be here."

Andy Dwyer,Am I right?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,My name is Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,You probably know me as the artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, after tonight, you'll only know me as the former artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat."
Andy Dwyer,I'm retiring from music.

Andy Dwyer,"So, thank you all for all the talking."
Andy Dwyer,"Let's just get back to dancing, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ron, can I ask you a question?"
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
Andy Dwyer,And then we find something that fits that list.
Andy Dwyer,We make a list of the reasons why you love them.
Andy Dwyer,"See, we don't make a list of the things that you love."
Andy Dwyer,You like dealing with people or dogs one-on-one.
Andy Dwyer,Once I was a golden swan swan of a man now that swan's name was Andy and he started a rock and roll band
Andy Dwyer,They're one-on-one.
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, Grandma."
Andy Dwyer,I think I have an idea that could save Ron.

Andy Dwyer,"And the streets, as you know, are dangerous."
Andy Dwyer,He actually has a really beautiful voice for a backup singer.
Andy Dwyer,It'll keep them off the street.
Andy Dwyer,It's an after school music class for at risk kids.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, it's the Redwood Music Program."
Andy Dwyer,I think I might have found something that's actually pretty cool.
Andy Dwyer,Ben?
Andy Dwyer,Ben?
Andy Dwyer,"You know what, I'm retiring from music."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Andy Dwyer,I'ma show these idiots what a big mistake they made.
Andy Dwyer,"I need piece of paper, I need a pen, I need four more beers, I need a computer fan, I need a lightning bolt of inspiration."
Andy Dwyer,It's song writing time.
Andy Dwyer,"And communism is no good, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Sometimes when you use a computer, it gets hot, and the fan cools it down."
Andy Dwyer,And what's the word for when a few clerics are in charge?
Andy Dwyer,Religious oligarchy.
Andy Dwyer,I can remember things.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, keep mine rare."
Andy Dwyer,Could we take a peek at it?
Andy Dwyer,"Also, I can't sleep, I'm overeating, none of my old hobbies interest me."
Andy Dwyer,It's just that life is pointless and nothing matters and I'm always tired.
Andy Dwyer,"But not without first a monster farewell performance solo on this stage tonight, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,So we need more for you.
Andy Dwyer,What do all the things on that list have in common?
Andy Dwyer,"I didn't have any paper, so I wrote it on my leg."
Andy Dwyer,All mine are dirty.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,I won't.
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you heard her, doc."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, hello, fellow employees."

Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, Hawaii."
Andy Dwyer,I'm an adult now.
Andy Dwyer,Give me more time to play video games.
Andy Dwyer,Like a giant hamster?
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!

Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,"Too handsome for glasses, no offense."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Why, so they can steal my swan song?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ha, joke's on them."
Andy Dwyer,That's good on places to live.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go back to dream jobs.
Andy Dwyer,"If we had to start a new life, I have Detective, FBI agent, policeman, CIA agent."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm gonna focus on business, which is good."
Andy Dwyer,And that's when my leg fell asleep.
Andy Dwyer,"We made, like, 100 million doctors' appointments for ourselves in one week."
Andy Dwyer,"Smudge, smudge, middle finger, smudge."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I had to make a new list."
Andy Dwyer,"And then, I lost the list."
Andy Dwyer,"Playing with our dog, staring contests, sex with me, etc."
Andy Dwyer,I made a list of everything that I know you like.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I have been thinking a lot about what you said."
Andy Dwyer,It's about April.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God! There's a room full of just guns."
Andy Dwyer,"I hurt her feelings, and now she's pissed at me."
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like if I could just explain myself, she'd understand, but she's avoiding me."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't eat any.
Andy Dwyer,"Then, he went with Janine, our counselor, and he fell asleep and got a boner."
Andy Dwyer,No one would ride in the boat with him because he had terrible BO.
Andy Dwyer,The rest are all smudges.
Andy Dwyer,I went to camp with this guy.
Andy Dwyer,It's making me miserable.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,I knew it!
Andy Dwyer,I didn't know that.
Andy Dwyer,Is she okay?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, duh."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe you could start your own museum.
Andy Dwyer,"But, hey, babe, listen."
Andy Dwyer,That's a bummer.
Andy Dwyer,"E, h, 4, m."
Andy Dwyer,Potato shape.
Andy Dwyer,Coffee mug shape.
Andy Dwyer,Zach Harrison?
Andy Dwyer,That's classic.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.

Andy Dwyer,"No, you're right."
Andy Dwyer,Where are the oven mitts?
Andy Dwyer,"No, we need to stick with what's on the list."
Andy Dwyer,You really think so?
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible to tell.
Andy Dwyer,It's like Bizarro Land out there.
Andy Dwyer,"As soon as we finish a song, it's dead silence."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm glad you like it."
Andy Dwyer,You were always a big supporter of the band.
Andy Dwyer,"First things first, oven mitts."

Andy Dwyer,I feel really good about this.
Andy Dwyer,It screams Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,Are you serious?
Andy Dwyer,The scream just got louder.
Andy Dwyer,I would totally shine his little shoes for free.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.

Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, dude."
Andy Dwyer,"Do you know what ""cute"" means?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I just figure we'll just order some pizza."
Andy Dwyer,"You watch me play Xbox, and then I could watch you make some prank phone calls?"

Andy Dwyer,We get hammered?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.

Andy Dwyer,Fork.
Andy Dwyer,I just want to get a good job for me and April.
Andy Dwyer,I want this to have the electricity of a live concert.

Andy Dwyer,"Uh, I love April."
Andy Dwyer,"Gum or mint, sir?"
Andy Dwyer,"All out, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"No, Burly, play it ""unperfectly."""
Andy Dwyer,"That's pretty good, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Maybe.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"We'll let you pay for your own food, because of equality."

Andy Dwyer,Is that cool?
Andy Dwyer,"But if that ends up meaning something in this game, I'd say I'm set."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea what's going on.
Andy Dwyer,"Seriously? That's all you needed? Tom, I have 1,000 dollars."
Andy Dwyer,You can have it.
Andy Dwyer,I'm a singer songwriter.
Andy Dwyer,I definitely have more lions than any other country in the whole world right now.
Andy Dwyer,I've just traded all of Finland's boring stuff for every other country's lions?
Andy Dwyer,These kids are idiots.
Andy Dwyer,And you don't have to pay them.
Andy Dwyer,But so are lions.
Andy Dwyer,"The two lines I've put into every song I've ever sang, ""Spread your wings and fly,"" and ""You deserve to be a champion."""
Andy Dwyer,"If you're telling me that all you need is 1,000 dollars to do your dreams, then I want you to have it."
Andy Dwyer,I could definitely picture myself doing something over there.
Andy Dwyer,"It seems to have a lot of potential and a lot of ""advantages,"" per se."
Andy Dwyer,I like it.
Andy Dwyer,The acoustics in the bathroom are insane.
Andy Dwyer,"""Stop writing phone messages on the wall, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Dude, seriously, I love you but stop digging that weird hole in the backyard."""
Andy Dwyer,"Well, we're not Mouse Rat anymore."
Andy Dwyer,We changed it to Tackleshaft.
Andy Dwyer,You can help me?
Andy Dwyer,"April, you're like an angel with no wings."
Andy Dwyer,She means it.
Andy Dwyer,"""That's not a working fireplace, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer,Don't laugh.
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, cool cryptex, can I have it?"
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Where'd you get it?

Andy Dwyer,"Oh, gosh, here's the thing-- I can't do it."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna have to be a robber.
Andy Dwyer,Now what the hell am I supposed to sing?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's sex! Oh, crap."
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, man."
Andy Dwyer,"I changed the lyrics in Sex Hair to You got sex bears you got 'em from me, kids sexbears big ol' sex bears"
Andy Dwyer,Tell me if this is appropriate for a kids' song.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, babe, here's what I did."
Andy Dwyer,Me too.

Andy Dwyer,Have you tried [Bleep]?
Andy Dwyer,Deal.
Andy Dwyer,Let's roll.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go look at them!
Andy Dwyer,Pigs in a blanket.
Andy Dwyer,I always wondered why they call them that.
Andy Dwyer,I know what things are.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, they both make bubbles, so."
Andy Dwyer,Look what I got.
Andy Dwyer,"I can afford, like, 300 bucks a month. I've always wanted a doorman named Ernie."
Andy Dwyer,That'd be awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Or Kipp.
Andy Dwyer,I'm pretty flexible on that.
Andy Dwyer,Look what I got from the bathroom.
Andy Dwyer,Mints.
Andy Dwyer,Six of 'em.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,That close!
Andy Dwyer,It was almost perfect.
Andy Dwyer,It's the greatest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
Andy Dwyer,But there's no way to know for sure.
Andy Dwyer,I noticed a weird vibe when we came into the room.
Andy Dwyer,We should ask him tomorrow.
Andy Dwyer,That's even better.

Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,They actually have rice in them.
Andy Dwyer,Soâ¦

Andy Dwyer,I'll be around.
Andy Dwyer,"And if you wanna talk, or grab coffee or something like that."
Andy Dwyer,I kind of forgot that you need money when you have a girlfriend.
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna treat April like a queen, and queens deserve flowers and massages, chocolate, booze, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, them treasure chests full of scarves, different kinds of lubes that warm up when you rub 'em on stuff."
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea why Ann is upset with me.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna give her all that stuff.
Andy Dwyer,But I do know she's too nice to yell at me in front of all these people.
Andy Dwyer,And more.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I am not leaving this bar."
Andy Dwyer,That sounds pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, let's do it."
Andy Dwyer,Okay?
Andy Dwyer,Hopefully that doesn't come up in my police work.
Andy Dwyer,I can never tell when people are lying to me.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, so we know it's not Jerry, unless he was lying to me."
Andy Dwyer,We are Scarecrow Boat!
Andy Dwyer,"I sold out! I got a boring office job in town, so I gotta dress up, you know, the grind."
Andy Dwyer,"Cost 3,000 bucks, but totally worth it."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you very much, everybody!"
Andy Dwyer,"You know what, maybe I should bail on being a cop."
Andy Dwyer,"When I get bummed out, I take my shirt off because the bad feelings make me feel sweaty."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, gosh, if I can't even investigate bad guys, why become a cop at all?"
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, he yelled at me when I tried to unroll 'em all, so"
Andy Dwyer,"If you rearrange the letters of Peru, you could spell Europe."
Andy Dwyer,"The way I figure it is, criminals love to wrap things up in rugs."
Andy Dwyer,Status update: My new suspect the dude who runs carpet emporium.
Andy Dwyer,But you seem like you do know what you're doing.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Captain."
Andy Dwyer,It would rule us all.
Andy Dwyer,"If they got together, they would make the most beautiful super baby."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Look who decided to join the party, bro!"
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, bye for real this time."
Andy Dwyer,The kool-aid guy makes it look so easy.
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,But what if super baby became too powerful?
Andy Dwyer,No deal.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'll do it."
Andy Dwyer,I'll do it.
Andy Dwyer,"""I need your signature, Mr. Dwyer."""
Andy Dwyer,"All right, take five, guys."
Andy Dwyer,"""That's not a toilet, Mr. Dwyer."""
Andy Dwyer,"I am, but I'm like Chuck Norris now-- some old guy with a beard who used to be good at karate but became a dumb has-been and is scared and confused about his big London job."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna go acoustic.
Andy Dwyer,The parallels between he and I are very eerie.
Andy Dwyer,"This next song is dedicated to her, my girlfriend, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I call it Ann.
Andy Dwyer,It does nothing.
Andy Dwyer,"Go ahead and sting me, bees."
Andy Dwyer,"I got stung once, I'm immune."
Andy Dwyer,"Don't worry, babe, I'll protect you."
Andy Dwyer,Ann
Andy Dwyer,You look great.
Andy Dwyer,"And I get a gun, and I can point it in people's faces."
Andy Dwyer,I promise.
Andy Dwyer,Ahh!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, Gary if that even is your real name Somebody stole my computer."
Andy Dwyer,"On it, boss."
Andy Dwyer,Can I help you move?
Andy Dwyer,"We could put out a dummy computer for them to steal, fill it with explosives first, Boom, take 'em all out."
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I know."
Andy Dwyer,"You gonna set up a perimeter, maybe bug a few phones?"
Andy Dwyer,"What's the play here, officer?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, listen, if you're mad about something, you should just"
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, I feel like you are mad."
Andy Dwyer,You're just gonna fill out this stupid report and that's it?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Ron, cool baby."
Andy Dwyer,My name's Ben.
Andy Dwyer,I'm mad.
Andy Dwyer,"Soft, soft lips."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, the monkey suit."
Andy Dwyer,Pit!
Andy Dwyer,"I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in it, the pit Pit!"
Andy Dwyer,"I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in that pit"
Andy Dwyer,So maybe you should just talk to us about it.
Andy Dwyer,"As a future cop, you have to understand, I cannot let this guy go."
Andy Dwyer,You should go wear that.
Andy Dwyer,"Um, I do."
Andy Dwyer,You think of everything.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you probably wanna stand to the side so people can see it."
Andy Dwyer,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,I'm really good at it.
Andy Dwyer,"Afterwards, I'll take the cardboard from the boxes and use it for break dancing."
Andy Dwyer,"Ha! Ha! Found it! I got-- I left my wallet in here earlier, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,Whoo! All good now.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, look! Noodles!"
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome!
Andy Dwyer,Where's your costume?
Andy Dwyer,"I think that that's really, really sweet, that your grandparents still make love."
Andy Dwyer,That's a pretty good costume actually.
Andy Dwyer,"Great idea, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,You look amazing.
Andy Dwyer,"But, uh, I think the Batman costume's way better."
Andy Dwyer,"Congratulations, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"""Grant Larson,"" otherwise known as Elton John."
Andy Dwyer,Did you--
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, well, I'm investing."
Andy Dwyer,We're completely ready---
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I'm just debriefing with the band."
Andy Dwyer,That is not true.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,You call him! You get me on the phone with Dr. Harris.
Andy Dwyer,Don't call him right now!
Andy Dwyer,Because it's late.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, just put the phone down."
Andy Dwyer,Fine! You want the truth?
Andy Dwyer,Mmm-mmm.
Andy Dwyer,"Could I have gotten my casts off two weeks ago? Technically, yes."
Andy Dwyer,But what--
Andy Dwyer,Is your penis between the front arms or the back legs?
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you take and really think about whether or not you want to be part of this?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, get it."
Andy Dwyer,That's good.
Andy Dwyer,There we go.
Andy Dwyer,He's got his back.
Andy Dwyer,"But I really, really like it when you serve me food."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, fight me."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't do anything wrong.
Andy Dwyer,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,It's Andy!
Andy Dwyer,And I think Leslie Knope did an amazing job.
Andy Dwyer,I think the merger was great.
Andy Dwyer,We got champagne.
Andy Dwyer,Complete with beautiful starlight.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I went ahead and set up the ultimate campsite love nest."
Andy Dwyer,I need to get more chips.
Andy Dwyer,Just kidding! I don't fall!
Andy Dwyer,I'm going.
Andy Dwyer,April! April! You wanna watch me rollerblade in the parking lot after work? I'm pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I used to be really good.
Andy Dwyer,It's really important to me that April loves camping.
Andy Dwyer,"That was, like, 70 pounds ago."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's lame."
Andy Dwyer,Tomorrow?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, walk."
Andy Dwyer,"Because if so, that was hilariously awfully funny how bad that was."
Andy Dwyer,Were you joking just now?
Andy Dwyer,Was that a joke?
Andy Dwyer,Why can't we just do our originals?
Andy Dwyer,"I just wrote a new song, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Bottom line, it's called Sex Hair."
Andy Dwyer,It's about how you can tell when someone's just had sex 'cause of how their hair gets matted up in the back.
Andy Dwyer,It's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,You got a point.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know about these old fogy songs, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I gotta go to the hospital.
Andy Dwyer,She stole money from you.
Andy Dwyer,I bet you I can guess what it is.
Andy Dwyer,Didn't it feel good?
Andy Dwyer,That's the beautiful thing about a box.
Andy Dwyer,Or twizzlers.
Andy Dwyer,"Kyle, I'm gonna lose my [bleep] on you if you ask me one more time."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, roomie, you can tell me, I bet there's something."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, guys."
Andy Dwyer,"So, there's that one, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,"Each time I do, Just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin, I've got you, Under my skin."
Andy Dwyer,My nose is broken.
Andy Dwyer,Noooo.
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,Nice!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,You can't-- I-- double shotgun! We call double shotgun! How come people don't do that more often?
Andy Dwyer,"Look at me and April, if you're anything like us, three weeks from now, you'll be married my friend."
Andy Dwyer,You're all nailed.
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun! I called shotgun!
Andy Dwyer,"and secondly, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen."
Andy Dwyer,Psych!
Andy Dwyer,"Well first of all, Leslie, she's like the coolest ever, you've chosen well."
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,Blood capsules.
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,I wanted to shock you into expressing your anger.
Andy Dwyer,And that way !
Andy Dwyer,I'm on the radio!
Andy Dwyer,"Also, rose petals."
Andy Dwyer,Who?
Andy Dwyer,"Say the word, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, let's get our stuff out of the boxes."
Andy Dwyer,Headlining.
Andy Dwyer,Sweet.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Have a good one.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,I'll carry five boxes!
Andy Dwyer,Not 'til you tell me what's wrong.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, she's here with her dad."
Andy Dwyer,And the hardest part about living in this pit is probably keeping my suit pressed.
Andy Dwyer,It'd be kind of rude to not do at least one more song.
Andy Dwyer,And the rats.
Andy Dwyer,It's like a freaking rat parade every night.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, let's go."
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,"This weekend, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Good seeing you.
Andy Dwyer,I like it.
Andy Dwyer,"And then more wrestling, but the fun kind, and then crying when the fun kind of wrestling got out of hand."
Andy Dwyer,"Using the Dwyer method, which was yelling, wrestling, crying, followed by lots of hugs."
Andy Dwyer,It's just gonna be just one second.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Leslie Knope!
Andy Dwyer,I'm so glad you made it.
Andy Dwyer,You have to meet my band.
Andy Dwyer,He likes me.
Andy Dwyer,An encore.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Gotta get back to the office.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,We need to deal with what's bothering you.
Andy Dwyer,See?
Andy Dwyer,You're angry at me and you're not talking about it.
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm gonna beat you up until you do, because I'm mature."
Andy Dwyer,Hi.
Andy Dwyer,I grew up with five brothers and we fought.
Andy Dwyer,"I just want to be close to her house, because I need to protect her."
Andy Dwyer,"Been looking at your file all day, Jerry if that even is your real name."
Andy Dwyer,'Cause there are some weird people that live around here.
Andy Dwyer,I just wanna get-- That's good hose water.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I was chasing our neighbor who's a total jagweed and I fell in some prickly bushes."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, hey, did you guys take my glasses too?"
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this.
Andy Dwyer,"So about a month ago I told everyone in the office that, at some point, they should steal something from my desk so I could practice."
Andy Dwyer,"See, part of the police academy entrance exam is investigating a crime."
Andy Dwyer,Doesn't matter.
Andy Dwyer,A game is the foot.
Andy Dwyer,They got my sunglasses too.
Andy Dwyer,It's gone.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you want my crusts? Here, take this."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, something is different about my computer."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you think of the house, huh? Were you totally surprised?"
Andy Dwyer,Do you love it?
Andy Dwyer,"As you can see, they smell terrific."
Andy Dwyer,I'll sick my army of lions on him.
Andy Dwyer,Somebody is getting gently laid tonight.
Andy Dwyer,Aha.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, by the way, I was gonna mention, you look really old in this picture."
Andy Dwyer,It's nothing.
Andy Dwyer,How do you spend your time in Miami?
Andy Dwyer,Don't get my shoes.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's up, guys?"
Andy Dwyer,"You come to help Tom move, too?"
Andy Dwyer,Too late!
Andy Dwyer,We already almost got all of it.
Andy Dwyer,On the cranium?
Andy Dwyer,It's been an awesome moving day.
Andy Dwyer,I got the little robot to play Dave Matthews.
Andy Dwyer,Little baby!
Andy Dwyer,He farted so much.
Andy Dwyer,That was awesome.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Back to the grindstone.
Andy Dwyer,"Awesome seeing you, dudes."
Andy Dwyer,What do you think?
Andy Dwyer,"Haha, you don't know it, but you just gave yourself away."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe fencing stolen computers?
Andy Dwyer,"I got football cards, and a travel mouthwash."
Andy Dwyer,600 dollars.
Andy Dwyer,"Split that four ways, boom."
Andy Dwyer,150 bucks?
Andy Dwyer,My face!
Andy Dwyer,"Is fine, Mikhail Petrov!"
Andy Dwyer,"It's so much better, it's crazy."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Damn it, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,Kyle?
Andy Dwyer,"My God, I could have killed her!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my face!"
Andy Dwyer,"you're doing really good, you're doing really good."
Andy Dwyer,"When April was born, I was already in third grade, which means if we were friends back then, I'd have been hanging out with a baby."
Andy Dwyer,April is the best but she's 20.
Andy Dwyer,"Aren't you, Little Sebastian?"
Andy Dwyer,But he's a close second.
Andy Dwyer,You're the best ever.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, dude!"
Andy Dwyer,I don't know anything about infant care.
Andy Dwyer,Can I get a badge?
Andy Dwyer,That is awesome sauce.
Andy Dwyer,Ahh!
Andy Dwyer,I ran over my testicles with my jazzy scooter.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that's a little unrealistic."
Andy Dwyer,What should I do?
Andy Dwyer,Because that's happening to me.
Andy Dwyer,Do pubic hairs get longer the older you get?
Andy Dwyer,This is a hard game.
Andy Dwyer,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, shut up!"
Andy Dwyer,Cooking is dumb.
Andy Dwyer,"We spent, like, 50 hours working on those burgers."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,It seems a little crazy.
Andy Dwyer,Man.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Just crazy enough to work.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, actually, I think it's pronounced ""horny."""
Andy Dwyer,Two million.
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI, on the case."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, sir."
Andy Dwyer,Will you time me? Go.
Andy Dwyer,"Yo, found some clues."
Andy Dwyer,Also found this.
Andy Dwyer,Weird stick.
Andy Dwyer,What was my time?
Andy Dwyer,Might be a clue.
Andy Dwyer,Yes! New record.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, well, hey, I'm gonna go run some more laps."
Andy Dwyer,"No, I got #8, and #22."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you know the one?"
Andy Dwyer,Nice!
Andy Dwyer,You got me in the face!
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Get me a beer?
Andy Dwyer,That one hurt.
Andy Dwyer,You've a good arm.
Andy Dwyer,"No! Wait, but we were gonna make a sparkle palace! Ron, you're walking across hot lava!"
Andy Dwyer,It's too bad there's not doctors for your mind.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, still good."
Andy Dwyer,Diane is awesome and she likes you.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, let's give this sucker a testdrive."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you should have been there."
Andy Dwyer,I finally hit my minimum requirement.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, that's good."
Andy Dwyer,Minimum champion!
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's what you think!"
Andy Dwyer,I hope you like pain!
Andy Dwyer,Pow!
Andy Dwyer,Looks like this Siberian husky is going to be Russian off to jail.
Andy Dwyer,I have gum in my hair.
Andy Dwyer,It sounds like you're really going through some tough stuff right now.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, look at my hair."
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, messy is fun, okay? My whole life is a giant mess and I love it."
Andy Dwyer,I can tell.
Andy Dwyer,And you like her.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to win you a million teddy bears.
Andy Dwyer,That's so cool.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for that.
Andy Dwyer,Super scared.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, that was awesome."
Andy Dwyer,That was really good.
Andy Dwyer,"I did eat all the bananas, so you can't play with those."
Andy Dwyer,Eagle Eyed Tiger.
Andy Dwyer,New band name.
Andy Dwyer,I call it.
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you gotta hear this hilarious story that he's telling me."
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I don't want to hurt you, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"But just promise me you'll be ready, because, I mean, I don't want to destroy you."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I see where we're going with this.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, hold up."
Andy Dwyer,Get off!
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,That's kind of true.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, when I get out, am I allowed to counterstrike?"
Andy Dwyer,Tell her what happened.
Andy Dwyer,His identity was stolen.
Andy Dwyer,Tell her about the accounts.
Andy Dwyer,Camping's the best.
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, ten bucks!"
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, now is this the most amazing grilled cheese sandwich ever made?"
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, my bucket list doesn't say ""make a pretty awesome grilled cheese sandwich."""
Andy Dwyer,Gotta go back to the store.
Andy Dwyer,We're gonna get a different kind of cheese.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,What do you mean?
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, do you think that maybe I should put Mark in a headlock?"
Andy Dwyer,What's next?
Andy Dwyer,How's the coolest chick ever?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"That way, I can show everyone how to escape a pervert?"
Andy Dwyer,Where are you going?
Andy Dwyer,Frozen.
Andy Dwyer,You wish.
Andy Dwyer,I'm super bad at days.
Andy Dwyer,"That's my spaghetti, Chewbacca."
Andy Dwyer,"But honestly, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,"Will you show me how to do that move, though?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, you know, thank you."
Andy Dwyer,"But really, I'm feeling great."
Andy Dwyer,I took a couple of aspirin and slept right through the night.
Andy Dwyer,I swear.
Andy Dwyer,It's almost like they don't want you to win.
Andy Dwyer,And-- Hold on a second.
Andy Dwyer,Ludgate.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh! Hey! Ann Perkins, in the ""shoe-shouse."""
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you better practice."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'm ready!"
Andy Dwyer,It tastes like a rug.
Andy Dwyer,Wait!
Andy Dwyer,I'm not ready.
Andy Dwyer,Don't hit me.
Andy Dwyer,I am.
Andy Dwyer,What the hell? I got you one of those veggie muffins that you're always eating.
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine?
Andy Dwyer,Block the opponent's punch and counter-punch to the jaw.
Andy Dwyer,Nice.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Punch to the balls.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I thought we were just talking about it."
Andy Dwyer,Are these old people really having sex with each other?
Andy Dwyer,"Well it always says ""Break glass in case of an emergency."
Andy Dwyer,""" Wait a second."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, there we go."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,They've never been the bad guys.
Andy Dwyer,How 'bout Germany?
Andy Dwyer,Even worse.
Andy Dwyer,The bad guys from Karate Kid 2?
Andy Dwyer,Don't think so.
Andy Dwyer,The bad guys from Mighty Ducks 2?
Andy Dwyer,No worries.
Andy Dwyer,I love camping.
Andy Dwyer,Shut up!
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that's like, the boy version of softball."
Andy Dwyer,"Ludgate, I can read you like the back of a book. something is upsetting you."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what it is?
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,This maze is like a maze.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you so much.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, ooh, ooh."
Andy Dwyer,Can we do one funny face one?
Andy Dwyer,You're not fine.
Andy Dwyer,It's so much more beautiful than I could have ever even imagined.
Andy Dwyer,You want me to climb on top of the Ferris wheel?
Andy Dwyer,What are we doing?
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I'm sorry."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, boss."
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I'm only going to say this once."
Andy Dwyer,What if Little Sebastian is on this Ferris wheel?
Andy Dwyer,311
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,You seem super not happy.
Andy Dwyer,Do that again.
Andy Dwyer,"It's called ""music,"" and there's only one way to get a vaccine, and that is to play it."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know how many of you have heard, but there's a flesheating virus going around."
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, babe."
Andy Dwyer,What does this do?
Andy Dwyer,"No thinking, just stupid."
Andy Dwyer,"So, if you had to sleep with one of the old guys, who would it be?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, are you alright?"
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,That is really gross.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"It seems risky, and I'd hate to see you go through another tough fight."
Andy Dwyer,"But I could be wrong, I haven't pooped in three days."
Andy Dwyer,I never would have ever done this without you.
Andy Dwyer,You just stand still next to the other horses and no one would ever know.
Andy Dwyer,It's the perfect crime.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Does your dad have anything good?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, crap! I didn't bring any music."
Andy Dwyer,You know what I call it?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I take Skittles, and I put it between two Starbursts."
Andy Dwyer,I knew that.
Andy Dwyer,30 hours?
Andy Dwyer,What's this?
Andy Dwyer,"Ew, Starlight Express, the original cast recording, act 1."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,What's this?
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, great idea."
Andy Dwyer,How long you think it'll take us?
Andy Dwyer,This car is nice!
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Yay!
Andy Dwyer,A psychotherapist for the city.
Andy Dwyer,What's this?
Andy Dwyer,Who Moved My Cheese? Book on tape?
Andy Dwyer,That's pretty good.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I call it Andy's mouth surprise."
Andy Dwyer,Kamikaze!
Andy Dwyer,You know what? I think I'll just... I'm gonna--
Andy Dwyer,"Uh... Yeah, actually, I should get going home."
Andy Dwyer,I have a lot of stuff to do.
Andy Dwyer,"You play whatever you want, I'm just going to take a real quick snooze for like 12 hours so I'm fresh."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I should go home."
Andy Dwyer,Clean and stuff.
Andy Dwyer,Butâ¦
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,See you!
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, will you please tell me why April is mad at me?"
Andy Dwyer,"That's what, you know, makes the sauce so awesome."
Andy Dwyer,Got you!
Andy Dwyer,No! I'll tell you what.
Andy Dwyer,Incoming!
Andy Dwyer,Bobby McFerrin.
Andy Dwyer,It's nice because the flavor of the Starbursts really bring out a similar flavor in the Skittles.
Andy Dwyer,To play the you get an injection
Andy Dwyer,You are absolutely right.
Andy Dwyer,There's no way we could even get there.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, our car would break down."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Andy Dwyer,That's not bad.
Andy Dwyer,"Or maybe a balloon popped somewhere and it scared him, sent him running off."
Andy Dwyer,"So we're gonna record this bitch tonight, 6 o'clock Doubletime Studio."
Andy Dwyer,"She originally put me in charge of hot dogs at this fundraising barbecue, and I dropped them all all of them, like a thousand, so I really want to do a good job."
Andy Dwyer,My job is the song.
Andy Dwyer,Ron and Diane sitting in a tree k I s s I s s I p p I.
Andy Dwyer,Everyone's got something they're in charge of for Leslie's campaign.
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, seaweed choke!"
Andy Dwyer,Good idea.
Andy Dwyer,Horses love mazes.
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Apartment!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll I'll try it."
Andy Dwyer,I did it.
Andy Dwyer,Do you hear that bird?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, I fell asleep again?"
Andy Dwyer,Were you about to spray me with the hose inside the house?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, ma'am."
Andy Dwyer,"Three picnic baskets, assorted cheeses, grapes, wine."
Andy Dwyer,April threw the smoked salmon on the roof.
Andy Dwyer,I kind of want you to do it now.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,No no no no no no.
Andy Dwyer,Please?
Andy Dwyer,I'll be right out.
Andy Dwyer,Or does it require two princesses?
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Andy Dwyer,I think it would really make Diane happy.
Andy Dwyer,Sweater swap!
Andy Dwyer,She noticed!
Andy Dwyer,You were right.
Andy Dwyer,"For the last time, Ron, it's princess rainbow sparkle."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe I should write a song about a picnic.
Andy Dwyer,I played baseball in high school.
Andy Dwyer,The picnic we're having.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Pretty good.
Andy Dwyer,Uh-huh.
Andy Dwyer,Honey?
Andy Dwyer,Can I get these?
Andy Dwyer,Doorbell!
Andy Dwyer,Doorbell!
Andy Dwyer,I'm trying to watch TV.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's it."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, that would be awesome."
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible.
Andy Dwyer,"It's kind of like We Are The World, except I actually think it could have a real impact on society."
Andy Dwyer,Bears bouncing on trampoline roads.
Andy Dwyer,There's a chance that I might have dreamed that.
Andy Dwyer,"It's called Catch Your Dream, and it's amazing."
Andy Dwyer,I have finished writing Leslie's campaign anthem.
Andy Dwyer,Chris!
Andy Dwyer,Could you pass me my itch stick?
Andy Dwyer,I think we've done everything on the list that we can actually do.
Andy Dwyer,because we need Eddie Vedder and a time machine.
Andy Dwyer,Then it could be about a girl.
Andy Dwyer,Or Peyton Manning!
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.
Andy Dwyer,You wanna help me write the lyrics?
Andy Dwyer,We should grab a drink after this at Tucker's.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?"
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't believe you fell in, too."
Andy Dwyer,Come here.
Andy Dwyer,"Here's the thing we need backup singers, and I thought, ""who better to be backup singers than Leslie's campaign team?"""
Andy Dwyer,"Your highnesses, we do humbly request thine permission to befix doth holes yonder."
Andy Dwyer,Where's all the faces? Like the presidents.
Andy Dwyer,I really like your dress.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, I'm Andy."
Andy Dwyer,This one would get me arrested and this other one's impossible.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go."
Andy Dwyer,You know where I would hide if I was horse. The merry-go-round. Think about it.
Andy Dwyer,"I already have the perfect title, Life is a Picnic."
Andy Dwyer,Well You have to rearrange them.
Andy Dwyer,"I bet you I can get you to love it, too."
Andy Dwyer,"If you hate it, we'll leave and go make out."
Andy Dwyer,It's okay.
Andy Dwyer,He's on my neck!
Andy Dwyer,He's on my neck!
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, dude."
Andy Dwyer,Just be cool.
Andy Dwyer,Here he is.
Andy Dwyer,"I probably should've said no to some of his ideas, but he's on his way here right now."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, how much should I sell this hat for?"
Andy Dwyer,"I kind of convinced Ben to prank you guys, and it got a little out of hand."

Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Let me explain something to you, Tweep."
Andy Dwyer,I cannot emphasize enough how little I was thinking.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, okay."
Andy Dwyer,Prank them back.
Andy Dwyer,Don't punish Donna and April.
Andy Dwyer,"If you want people to like you, you have to play along."

Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"I know that you're the governor or whatever, and I'm just government junior."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I could help you."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I always think April's going to clean up."
Andy Dwyer,"And then afterwards, had sex with Mark and everyone talked about it."

Andy Dwyer,No job.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I run for April.
Andy Dwyer,I run for love.

Andy Dwyer,We could do something off my bucket list.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm like Warren ""Buffay."""

Andy Dwyer,"But I feel like Tom really needed the money, and small sacrifice to see one of your best friends' dreams come true."
Andy Dwyer,How did you sleep?
Andy Dwyer,"300,000 dollars?"
Andy Dwyer,"Morning, roomie."

Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,April hates Valentine's Day.
Andy Dwyer,Still a lot left over.
Andy Dwyer,And brunch.
Andy Dwyer,That would be fun.
Andy Dwyer,that's super disappointing.
Andy Dwyer,And smiling.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm a college course Graduate, and it's all because of you."
Andy Dwyer,And it's probably a little too expensive.
Andy Dwyer,You didn't sell you table.
Andy Dwyer,"You are sad, and we know why."

Andy Dwyer,"Oh, nice."
Andy Dwyer,Yo.

Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I do."
Andy Dwyer,"Not if I see you first, uncle Ron, and I probably will because Leslie assigned me to the kidnap squad."
Andy Dwyer,Aah!
Andy Dwyer,"Um, I can't really get into a shower, so I got this idea from my parents."

Andy Dwyer,You're underage.
Andy Dwyer,I'm calling it.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, why don't you win me that huge-ass bear as a going-away present?"
Andy Dwyer,"No, I feel like we need to inflate it more."
Andy Dwyer,I'll karate punch your face with my tongue.
Andy Dwyer,Morning Ron.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm in charge of booking the bands for the concert, and I say, you're in."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, dude, you forgot to put a shirt, I do it all the time, it's fine."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's up, people of Pawnee?"
Andy Dwyer,"Is there a master plan in the works, a grand design?"
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be playing when she walks through the door today.
Andy Dwyer,You're gonna play right after Bobby knight ranger.
Andy Dwyer,We're just about to start.
Andy Dwyer,Mmmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,"Ohh Oh, babe, thank God you're here."
Andy Dwyer,I need to do everything on April's list or she's not going to go out with me.
Andy Dwyer,"So a little birdie told me it's your birthday coming up, how about a free birthday shoe shine?"
Andy Dwyer,Get in.
Andy Dwyer,That's right.
Andy Dwyer,That's the best part.
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,Super sorry.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so bored.
Andy Dwyer,"Just missed you so bad, honey, I bought myself a ticket home."
Andy Dwyer,"Just remember, every time you look up at the moon, I, too, will be looking at a moon."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I didn't."
Andy Dwyer,I had to massage a ton of feet.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, you give me that war ending necklace, or I will resort to torture."
Andy Dwyer,We should split a turkey sometime.
Andy Dwyer,You know that.
Andy Dwyer,That's impossible.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah! Shove it there!"
Andy Dwyer,I can't go back to London.
Andy Dwyer,I think you do!
Andy Dwyer,"Someone's back from London, no, it's not the queen someone's back from London, it's not Mr. Bean."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, hey."
Andy Dwyer,How do you know about camp David?
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Andy Dwyer,I guess we're even.
Andy Dwyer,"Look Ron, I love you like a father who's not that much older than me, like a young uncle, or like you're my camp counselor, but we hang out and it's not weird."
Andy Dwyer,Just dumb stuff like that.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,"Or actually here's what it is, you're my lacrosse coach--"
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Who's going to be there?
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you brag about it?
Ann Perkins,I just found out Andy's getting married.
Ann Perkins,"Yuck, that's somehow worse."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, it did."
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go home.
Ann Perkins,"However, he proudly told me that he ""beat herpes."""
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, Donna."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Guys.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I love you so much.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, give you a ride home?"
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Ann Perkins,Who was Rebecca?
Ann Perkins,"Tom and I have been seeing each other for a few weeks, and I think I'm ready to say, ""I love you"" To his apartment."
Ann Perkins,MonaLisa happened to me.
Ann Perkins,Pathetic? Maybe.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, they do look a little bit swollen."
Ann Perkins,Ketchup and mustard.
Ann Perkins,Tom.
Ann Perkins,You have to get up off the floor now.
Ann Perkins,Just follow the pen.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,It was funny.
Ann Perkins,"I'm supposed to meet Leslie for lunch, but she actually works, so."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's gone."
Ann Perkins,Nothing like a complete physical breakdown to make a guy seem less intimidating.
Ann Perkins,I love the flu.
Ann Perkins,Ooh Oh
Ann Perkins,What are you wearing?
Ann Perkins,Follow the pen to--
Ann Perkins,Does that hurt?
Ann Perkins,You're getting your commendation tomorrow at the Statehouse.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I salsa your face."
Ann Perkins,Thanks for driving me.
Ann Perkins,She covered me in glitter and Anna Nicole body spray.
Ann Perkins,Why do they still even make that?
Ann Perkins,"Now it's your turn to help me, okay?"
Ann Perkins,You need to break things off with me and MonaLisa.
Ann Perkins,You gotta see this.
Ann Perkins,That sounds elaborate.
Ann Perkins,"All we did was punch ""jewelry store"" into our car GPS."
Ann Perkins,"See you around, maybe."
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Ann Perkins,Cool.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I think it's great that you're cool with Tom's financial situation."
Ann Perkins,Come in.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but he had to borrow a lot of money, and when you're not around, Tom drinks tap water."
Ann Perkins,Mark was brought to my hospital the night of the accident.
Ann Perkins,Now is a great time.
Ann Perkins,I've been standing in the water with the fish on my hook for 30 minutes.
Ann Perkins,"I'm not I mean, it shouldn't matter, but I'm"
Ann Perkins,Help.
Ann Perkins,I saw it on an episode I Love Lucy.
Ann Perkins,"You remember that romantic moment, Chris?"
Ann Perkins,That came out wrong.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, this magic marker smells like cherries."
Ann Perkins,"But, feels pretty good to have a bunch of little boys be super into me."
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,Get me out of this friendship!
Ann Perkins,"Chris, can I talk to you for a second?"
Ann Perkins,Just don't do anything on my desk
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,This is really thorough.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for meeting us.
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,You let me pee with the door open so I could watch the end of Grey's Anatomy.
Ann Perkins,We're moving to a new city.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we're having a child together."
Ann Perkins,Right?
Ann Perkins,What were you talking to Evelyn about?
Ann Perkins,"If neither of us has ever thought about this stuff, then maybe there's a reason."
Ann Perkins,"You know, we'd really appreciate it if you didn't print that stuff 'cause we're trying to build this park--"
Ann Perkins,Hang on.
Ann Perkins,"That may be tough, 'cause we actually haven't discussed it yet."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, why spend thousands of dollars just to reaffirm what we already know, which is that we love each other?"
Ann Perkins,Please don't let this ruin your night.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, I got something."
Ann Perkins,"I'm a nurse, actually."
Ann Perkins,"Look, you guys have survived this long."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,What do you think mummies are?
Ann Perkins,A whole shelf of coconut water.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,That's so nice.
Ann Perkins,Where'd you find that?
Ann Perkins,"Excited, yeah."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Nice to meet you.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,USA!
Ann Perkins,Looks like you've made all your decisions.
Ann Perkins,It's Halloween.
Ann Perkins,You have to break up with her.
Ann Perkins,That doesn't happen that often.
Ann Perkins,Cheese plate and Adriatic figs.
Ann Perkins,You and I need to find a way to fix this reporter thing.
Ann Perkins,"Well, apparently, the reporter is gonna print everything you said to her."
Ann Perkins,How did your wild dirtbag fantasy night work out?
Ann Perkins,You've mentioned that before.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"""The park is never, ever, ever, ever getting built?"""
Ann Perkins,Chris can be very Paternal.
Ann Perkins,'Cause check it out.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, I know what would cheer you up."
Ann Perkins,Let's have fun.
Ann Perkins,Who cares!
Ann Perkins,Did you say it was off the record?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I suppose you're right, John."
Ann Perkins,How were we together for five months?
Ann Perkins,"He's deeply in debt, but you know what?"
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Ron is making the model, and then we're going to put all of our candy decorations in our corners of the office."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so what did everybody make?"
Ann Perkins,He just lives like this.
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,You love Halloween.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,You still owe me a blanket.
Ann Perkins,She's not answering her phone.
Ann Perkins,"Tom, good luck."
Ann Perkins,In my front yard.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, just put your damn candy out."
Ann Perkins,Grossest metaphor ever.
Ann Perkins,We were together for a really long time.
Ann Perkins,"No, I don't think so."
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, what if he thinks I'm asking too much of him, and I ask him to plant the ficuses, and he doesn't want to, and he gets weird about it, and it ruins our friendship?"
Ann Perkins,I wish that were possible.
Ann Perkins,You don't have to pretend I know you're supposed to meet Leslie here.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, those are poisonous, so no one eat them."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie's busy, she's working on the Li'l Sebastian memorial service."
Ann Perkins,So that's my ex-boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, definitely."
Ann Perkins,"Tom, she's coming!"
Ann Perkins,Go throw up.
Ann Perkins,"And she also wanted me to kiss you deeply, which I'm gonna have to pass on."
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Ann Perkins,I really like my part-time job here.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, D-money."
Ann Perkins,It would be nice to have an office.
Ann Perkins,I bought this mackerel at the supermarket.
Ann Perkins,"One on the ottoman, one on the chair, one on the couch here, feel."
Ann Perkins,"My office mate moved down the hall, so I have this whole room just for me."
Ann Perkins,"And Ben and Leslie, who secretly meet here."
Ann Perkins,40 times a day.
Ann Perkins,Look at all these blankets.
Ann Perkins,Go throw up.
Ann Perkins,"But you know what, she gave me this note to give to you."
Ann Perkins,Tom!
Ann Perkins,What lead?
Ann Perkins,What do you mean?
Ann Perkins,Gross.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,That's great.
Ann Perkins,We do not wanna have a threesome with you.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Mmhmm.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Ann Perkins,That is accurate.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Yikes.
Ann Perkins,"You're the, uh"
Ann Perkins,Why are you dressed as a pilgrim?
Ann Perkins,You look weird.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Chris!"
Ann Perkins,Got to run to a meeting.
Ann Perkins,With Ron.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, the door was open."
Ann Perkins,"Chris broke up with his girlfriend a week ago, and I have decided to ask him to be the father of my baby."
Ann Perkins,Except I cannot work up the nerve to do it.
Ann Perkins,Turns out they don't make greeting cards for asking your exboyfriend if he will artificially inseminate you.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, Ron, I could use your advice on how to be blunt and honest."
Ann Perkins,"I want my friend to do something for me, and I don't know how to ask him."
Ann Perkins,Plant ficuses.
Ann Perkins,What are you oh.
Ann Perkins,"Look, you guys are totally welcome to use my office."
Ann Perkins,Is Ron gonna be okay?
Ann Perkins,Like tendonitis?
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Chris something.
Ann Perkins,I'm not really attached to the way this stuff is arranged.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but I only knew about it an hour ago."
Ann Perkins,And your friendship is the most important thing to me.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,"Just as good, if not exactly the same as the last one."
Ann Perkins,"No, of course you are."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"your pulse is super fast, but that wouldn't be out of line for someone who drank and then barfed up a gallon of sugar water."
Ann Perkins,That's kind of the whole thing.
Ann Perkins,I really think we've got it.
Ann Perkins,Which part are you not sure about?
Ann Perkins,Did you just start your run?
Ann Perkins,What's happening?
Ann Perkins,Could you maybe find new advisors?
Ann Perkins,I broke it off with Ricky.
Ann Perkins,"I bought a lasso online, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,Or the stuff itself.
Ann Perkins,"Who's ""we""? What are you-- Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Ann Perkins,Think it over.
Ann Perkins,Will you be the sperm donor?
Ann Perkins,I turned all my jeans into Daisy Dukes.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I want to have a baby.
Ann Perkins,You're gonna get through this.
Ann Perkins,But you're not sweating at all.
Ann Perkins,In front of Perd?
Ann Perkins,But eventually this'll pass.
Ann Perkins,And I meant it.
Ann Perkins,"This sucks, I am not gonna convince you that it doesn't, and you can tell me every day for the next year about how much this sucks."
Ann Perkins,Can I say something?
Ann Perkins,"My personality kinda gets swept up in whatever guy I'm dating, and I want to change that."
Ann Perkins,Not really.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Well.
Ann Perkins,It's something very important.
Ann Perkins,I have a question for you.
Ann Perkins,It's like you have furry toes.
Ann Perkins,"""Christoefur."""
Ann Perkins,Christopher.
Ann Perkins,I think that would be best.
Ann Perkins,"Paris, Hawaii, the Grand Canyon."
Ann Perkins,Which is What is your Spirit animal?
Ann Perkins,What happened?
Ann Perkins,"Not like, ""Damn, you're fine,"" but fine healthwise."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, I mean, yes, of of course, let's do it."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,Nice.
Ann Perkins,Keep punching.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I think we should be adults and talk about this."
Ann Perkins,"I just saw you a few hours ago, and you were fine."
Ann Perkins,"Or this house, even, really."
Ann Perkins,Doing a survey.
Ann Perkins,So take her easy.
Ann Perkins,"What about, like, an actual meadow where wildflowers are?"
Ann Perkins,Get back in that bed.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Well, you know, actually, we haven't discussed it in a while."
Ann Perkins,Get back in the bed.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, there you go."
Ann Perkins,"Either you get back in the bed, or I will strap you down."
Ann Perkins,"Well, survey completed."
Ann Perkins,I've done it before.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I could stop, and you could walk."
Ann Perkins,"Or you know what, we could meet in the middle."
Ann Perkins,he always just throws me off.
Ann Perkins,Hello.
Ann Perkins,Although I did see Chris today.
Ann Perkins,Welp.
Ann Perkins,Don't test me.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey."
Ann Perkins,And he's off-limits.
Ann Perkins,I kind of lost myself in this relationship.
Ann Perkins,"No, you were right."
Ann Perkins,Describe your ideal man.
Ann Perkins,I'm going to be professional and I'm going to put on a happy face.
Ann Perkins,I think you should launch a fullscale investigation.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie they're just talking."
Ann Perkins,Turtles?
Ann Perkins,Fish?
Ann Perkins,"Well, not everything's different, right?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's because, uh, I'm mortified."
Ann Perkins,"And then, I'm going to go into a supply closet and snap a bunch of tongue depressors."
Ann Perkins,These things are horrible when you're by yourself.
Ann Perkins,I am so excited to see you here.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Donna.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,My house is really close by.
Ann Perkins,I feel like I'm being obvious.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's do that."
Ann Perkins,I'm not going to do it.
Ann Perkins,You're right.
Ann Perkins,"So, chop-chop."
Ann Perkins,And I'm ovulating on Thursday.
Ann Perkins,'Cause I'm getting antsy.
Ann Perkins,"Or just maybe, like, a couple days."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Take as much time as you want.
Ann Perkins,"Of course, yes."
Ann Perkins,I'm so sorry that I was so weird and blunt.
Ann Perkins,If my baby turned out to be anything like you I'd be lucky.
Ann Perkins,That's a terrible choice of words.
Ann Perkins,A four date long relationship might not be 100% perfect?
Ann Perkins,You are a great specimen.
Ann Perkins,I know what she's trying to do.
Ann Perkins,And I'll start now.
Ann Perkins,She's trying to get me to break.
Ann Perkins,And you know what?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, never mind."
Ann Perkins,I was nervous after yesterday because I was thinking what does this mean for us?
Ann Perkins,"Because it's really hot, and I'm tired."
Ann Perkins,Am I not being obvious enough?
Ann Perkins,"Well, if you ask me, you were elected to lead and not to follow."
Ann Perkins,So I need to stay away from Chris.
Ann Perkins,Which is probably what I should've said instead of what I did say.
Ann Perkins,I would have never imagined the babymaking process to be this clinical.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, imagine if actual sex were like this."
Ann Perkins,"Traditionally, when I end a long-term relationship, I'm a little fragile, and I have a tendency to do some reckless things."
Ann Perkins,Exactly.
Ann Perkins,What are you going to say out there?
Ann Perkins,And we were also pretty good at those physical activities.
Ann Perkins,I'm really busy right now.
Ann Perkins,"You know, is this all the pamphlets?"
Ann Perkins,'Cause I think that maybe I have some left in my bedroom.
Ann Perkins,I am so sorry.
Ann Perkins,Let's find those.
Ann Perkins,Glad I could help in these trying times.
Ann Perkins,Hurry.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Can we stop, please?"
Ann Perkins,I just wanted to come lend my support.
Ann Perkins,Am I right?
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Give it a rest.
Ann Perkins,Cats?
Ann Perkins,What do you think of dogs?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,He's got a couple of scrapes and a dislocated shoulder.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"No, you won't."
Ann Perkins,"Because if you do that, you will die."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, deep breath."
Ann Perkins,He's okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you look great."
Ann Perkins,"No, you won't."
Ann Perkins,"Not as parents, but as Chris and Ann? I don't think on-again, off-again is a great parental model."
Ann Perkins,"But if there is a hypothetical chance that we could provide a home with two parents who are hypothetically together, then that could be even better hypothetically."
Ann Perkins,I'm pretty happy right now generally.
Ann Perkins,So how does this work?
Ann Perkins,Here.
Ann Perkins,"Sexy, well read blonde."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"I was gonna wait till he was single to ask him, but now he's flirting with Shauna again."
Ann Perkins,"I think when his head hit the ground, it must've knocked something loose, because he's actually a pretty nice guy now."
Ann Perkins,I wanted to ask Chris to be the father of my baby.
Ann Perkins,Here.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, there are no ficuses, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,They're in public.
Ann Perkins,Do you just have to pee real bad?
Ann Perkins,It's disgusting.
Ann Perkins,They are flirting like crazy.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, MonaLisa?"
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,You ready to rock this profile?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Go find him and tell him how you feel.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"And Andy, after we broke up, he told me he was going to Kansas to climb mountains."
Ann Perkins,No There's no chart.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I don't have his chart in front of me.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"He was old, and he had a lot of ailments."
Ann Perkins,And then the two of you could work it out together.
Ann Perkins,22 seconds.
Ann Perkins,What are you going to do about Ben?
Ann Perkins,There's no one else here.
Ann Perkins,"Ooh, that does sound fun."
Ann Perkins,Loves the sweeter things in life.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,What do I do?
Ann Perkins,Then tell him that.
Ann Perkins,I have those cotton tshirt sheets.
Ann Perkins,What are you going for?
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"Is that a screwdrive no, I do not want to fight."
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we're not dating any more, okay? Get out."
Ann Perkins,Get out.
Ann Perkins,He was here for a week.
Ann Perkins,Catch up and mustard.
Ann Perkins,I actually live in the neighborhood So I could probably tell you a little bit about--
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"We haven't told our families or chosen a venue, but it's not a shotgun wedding."
Ann Perkins,They're green.
Ann Perkins,And his tie is green.
Ann Perkins,"So, like, maybe there's something there, where, like, he went to school with his high school buddies that were dinosaurs."
Ann Perkins,And he's wearing a green tie.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,"Um, okay, so Councilman Milton is old, right?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, wow."
Ann Perkins,"I don't know if you should lead with ""I'm dying."""
Ann Perkins,I used to date Tom.
Ann Perkins,Condoms.
Ann Perkins,"And it would be great if you could come, voice your strong support."
Ann Perkins,20% of the precincts reporting.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Do you see what is happening with Chris and Shauna?
Ann Perkins,I just wanna talk to you woman to woman because I know Tom pretty well.
Ann Perkins,I don't.
Ann Perkins,You know what used to drive me nuts?
Ann Perkins,Bobby Newport is up by 140 votes.
Ann Perkins,"Um, We are having a public forum tomorrow night."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I'm just helping Leslie plan Li'I Sebastian's memorial service.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Disgusting?
Ann Perkins,"Whatever this is, I don't want it."
Ann Perkins,He is a total control freak.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you have to put a coaster down on every surface, and the worst part is, they're all made out of pictures from Diddy's Instagram."
Ann Perkins,Who are you yelling at?
Ann Perkins,How are you gonna vote?
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Bullseye.
Ann Perkins,"But I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or?"
Ann Perkins,"I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is awkward."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I've been a nurse for over 10 years.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, please, don't."
Ann Perkins,It's not something you just quit.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't want to ever keep secrets from you."
Ann Perkins,It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"But in the meantime, I'm just gonna tell you in English."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April."
Ann Perkins,I saw that you called for me.
Ann Perkins,What can I do for you?
Ann Perkins,An actual request.
Ann Perkins,I don't think so.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, no."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Would it change your mind if we told you that--
Ann Perkins,That would be like a date.
Ann Perkins,"Now, I have to tell you, I don't actually work in the Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,"Good dressing, too, right?"
Ann Perkins,Same basic ingredients as bird feed.
Ann Perkins,What's that?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Do you want to make out?
Ann Perkins,"God, he is more tightly wound than ever."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"He weirdly asked me to go see a movie with him, and I said no, of course, but I just I just wanted to let you know."
Ann Perkins,Mark kind of asked me out.
Ann Perkins,Flaxseed and agave.
Ann Perkins,I love you too.
Ann Perkins,Anything in--
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"So, did the neighbors give you any problems?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, you definitely have the flu."
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,It made me feel so happy that I knew somebody was here taking care of my house.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.
Ann Perkins,No part of this is how I pictured it.
Ann Perkins,It's so nice to see you so happy about a guy.
Ann Perkins,I'm a nurse.
Ann Perkins,But I heard it's really good.
Ann Perkins,Leslie!
Ann Perkins,"Hey, have you seen Leslie?"
Ann Perkins,I have no idea actually.
Ann Perkins,I don't know what I'm doing.
Ann Perkins,I cannot believe I dated him.
Ann Perkins,The door?
Ann Perkins,For a long time.
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,And he broke up with me!
Ann Perkins,"No, I haven't."
Ann Perkins,"So, I don't really know where he is."
Ann Perkins,Hold on.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, say it again."
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Hobbies?
Ann Perkins,Favorite place?
Ann Perkins,I want to see it.
Ann Perkins,Maybe.
Ann Perkins,I could see that.
Ann Perkins,Every time.
Ann Perkins,It could be anywhere in the world.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's funny, right?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we're already planning on having a baby together."
Ann Perkins,We're not quite a couple but
Ann Perkins,You say that about every girl you date.
Ann Perkins,Great form.
Ann Perkins,You said that about me.
Ann Perkins,Deal.
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Ann Perkins,"Well, you can't have any."
Ann Perkins,"That stuff is powerful, no extra doses."
Ann Perkins,Yup.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's can we take a break?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna dump a girl for you.
Ann Perkins,Did she assault you?
Ann Perkins,"Hi, April."
Ann Perkins,"Tom, thank you."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"All right, what the hell."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Why are you giving it to me now?
Ann Perkins,Valentine's Day was a month ago.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for bringing that up in front of a reporter.
Ann Perkins,"She's taking care of my house while I'm away, so--"
Ann Perkins,Andyâ¦
Ann Perkins,I have another stop on the pride swallowing tour of City Hall.
Ann Perkins,You're allowed to do that.
Ann Perkins,Just waiting for April.
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,Why are you letting her get to you like this
Ann Perkins,Keep eating.
Ann Perkins,I gotta run.
Ann Perkins,"This is one of those nanny cam teddy bears, isn't it?"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is my friend Howard Tuttleman."
Ann Perkins,I think so.
Ann Perkins,Just stand over there and don't drip on anything.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Water the plants, get the mail."
Ann Perkins,That's basically it.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, why don't we just go back in there and talk about the park?"
Ann Perkins,It's so quiet.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,This is a total failure.
Ann Perkins,"Donna, there's a camera in it."
Ann Perkins,I don't think that's true.
Ann Perkins,This party is a failure.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and also she said that they're not from her, they're from Santa Claus."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's not that bad, right?"
Ann Perkins,You guys will really like each other.
Ann Perkins,It's not weird.
Ann Perkins,You deserve way better than that.
Ann Perkins,"Well, thank you for being a doctor and not coming dressed as a doctor."
Ann Perkins,I am going to bid a million dollars on myself.
Ann Perkins,"Going once, going never, sold."
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I just I can't believe I'm just finding this out right now."
Ann Perkins,I did not ask you to do that.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's ad is just better."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,A good chef never reveals her secrets.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, Galentine's day?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, the bravery."
Ann Perkins,Do you want some more? Are you hungry still?
Ann Perkins,Everybody brings their own unique strengths to the table.
Ann Perkins,Some that even I don't have.
Ann Perkins,This looks like fun.
Ann Perkins,I want to try.
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, hi."
Ann Perkins,"I was looking for Leslie, but now I'm curious why you guys are sitting around doing nothing and getting drunk at work."
Ann Perkins,You ranked them?
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry Chris was such a jerk.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie wishes she could be here herself to give you these presents, but she's suspended."
Ann Perkins,"Why did you get arrested, what did you do?"
Ann Perkins,Justin's gonna meet you there.
Ann Perkins,Here.
Ann Perkins,I'm so out of sorts.
Ann Perkins,You've been here?
Ann Perkins,One minute would be amazing.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,You're an American hero.
Ann Perkins,Perfect.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys."
Ann Perkins,Here.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Tom."
Ann Perkins,Mad Hatter?
Ann Perkins,The perseverance.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, I'm sorry."
Ann Perkins,"Look, you love harder than anyone I know."
Ann Perkins,One minute.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,I have a guy fixing my bathroom.
Ann Perkins,I got to go.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"I just meant, you know"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I knew you'd drop everything and rush here, and contractions can sometimes go for days."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,So I didn't want you to be stuck waiting around.
Ann Perkins,Perfect.
Ann Perkins,Except that I'm a whale and that my feet already kill.
Ann Perkins,"I rented District 9, if you maybe wanted to spoil that for me tonight."
Ann Perkins,I am a crazy shape.
Ann Perkins,"This morning when I got out of bed, I just tipped forward like a poorly made bowling pin."
Ann Perkins,Did I mention that my feet kill me all the time?
Ann Perkins,I can't do this right now.
Ann Perkins,It was fine.
Ann Perkins,"Oliver Perkins-Traeger, meet your Aunt Leslie."
Ann Perkins,Excellent.
Ann Perkins,Who's Ginuwine?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you live down here."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe this is happening!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I can't be at my house and see my exboyfriend living in a hole in my backyard like a gopher.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, there was way too much stuff for me to read tonight, anyway."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, it was a ridiculous amount of stuff that you gave me."
Ann Perkins,"That's so weird, Andy."
Ann Perkins,"Don't know what you're thinking, but I'm definitely not thinking what you're thinking."
Ann Perkins,You've been here a whole week?
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,"Well first of all, this color looks amazing on you."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I guess I guess that's the office you were telling me about that you go to work to every day."
Ann Perkins,I didn't mean it like that.
Ann Perkins,Ready to do some factcheckin'?
Ann Perkins,Here we go.
Ann Perkins,I'm glad you're okay.
Ann Perkins,"And I thought this would maybe, I don't know, give us a chance to get a little closer."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, I'm thinking about getting a new phone."
Ann Perkins,Do you guys like your phones?
Ann Perkins,Why is everyone always in the kitchen?
Ann Perkins,"Plus, there's always been a little distance between me and April."
Ann Perkins,"I would have asked Leslie, but I've seen the way she takes care of her house."
Ann Perkins,I'm paying April 50 bucks to watch my house while I'm away.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,That's right.
Ann Perkins,"What about you, Ron?"
Ann Perkins,Do you like your phone?
Ann Perkins,Here's my goal.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna get these two people that I've known for a long time to talk to me for five minutes.
Ann Perkins,Who am I kidding?
Ann Perkins,"And here are the keys, and remember--"
Ann Perkins,"I spent the whole day decorating this place, and everybody's in the kitchen."
Ann Perkins,"So, I just set up Justin and Leslie."
Ann Perkins,Maybe even--
Ann Perkins,"Oh, he was such a good coach that the nurses asked him to help out with a delivery down the hall."
Ann Perkins,Call me tomorrow?
Ann Perkins,Helping Leslie.
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,Okeydoke.
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, you don't think it's weird that my exboyfriend lives in a tent in the pit outside my house?"
Ann Perkins,Dude!
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I always knew he was lazy, but this is, like, a new low for him."
Ann Perkins,"Please, don't."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it doesn't matter."
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go choke down those horse pills I have to take every day.
Ann Perkins,And I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Ann Perkins,Who knows?
Ann Perkins,Become friends.
Ann Perkins,Chris is so wonderful and thoughtful and positive.
Ann Perkins,He's driving me up the wall.
Ann Perkins,I don't care.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,It's tough to match.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, I'm not gonna talk for long, 'cause I have to pee again, 'cause I have to pee every six minutes, 'cause I have a beach ball in my stomach that's punching on my bladder."
Ann Perkins,"Larry, get in there!"
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,Emergency whine & cheese club.
Ann Perkins,"Put your headphones on, Ron."
Ann Perkins,I have a lot of complaints.
Ann Perkins,Sit down.
Ann Perkins,I need to vent.
Ann Perkins,And do not under any circumstances respond to anything I say.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,"Let's talk about vomit, kids."
Ann Perkins,I do it all day long.
Ann Perkins,She's totally fine.
Ann Perkins,"Oh my god, are you kidding, are you okay."
Ann Perkins,Hey jail bird.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you have to stop using the word ""nipple."""
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"""Hope we can get together soon."""
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Mm.
Ann Perkins,Now I have pre-postpartum depression anxiety.
Ann Perkins,"Please don't do anything weird, I beg you."
Ann Perkins,"You're awesome, and there's a million other guys out there."
Ann Perkins,"If he doesn't want to go out with you, he's nuts."
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"I just started dating Chris, and I don't know how, but Andy's gonna screw it up."
Ann Perkins,There's got to be something we can do.
Ann Perkins,Andy screws everything up.
Ann Perkins,"That's a very appealing offer, thank you."
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,"When we were dating, I bought him a fish and I don't want to get into it, but somehow that fish ended up dead in a cowboy boot."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, there's kids around here."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Ann, it was great talking to you last night."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,He hurt his hand.
Ann Perkins,Wanna head home?
Ann Perkins,What did he say exactly?
Ann Perkins,I'll do that too.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, we have to get the wedding cake."
Ann Perkins,Piece of cake.
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,This place is beautiful.
Ann Perkins,"Bye, guys."
Ann Perkins,I think you know what it means.
Ann Perkins,"You're the man, Swanson."
Ann Perkins,Thanks for coming.
Ann Perkins,Dude.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.
Ann Perkins,I don't even know what to say.
Ann Perkins,"Wow, Donna."
Ann Perkins,"God, you're such a baby."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I'm perfectly calm.
Ann Perkins,"I feel like every crazy thing Leslie's ever had me do has been, like a drill, and today is the real thing."
Ann Perkins,"I'm ready, because I had the greatest teacher in the world."
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,He seemed really into you.
Ann Perkins,Is he joking?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Well, well, well."
Ann Perkins,If it isn't Mr. Best Man and Bachelor boy.
Ann Perkins,I love her so much.
Ann Perkins,But I think I'm going to draw a mustache on her face.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I like this guy."
Ann Perkins,I should hate him.
Ann Perkins,"You know, when he saw me, I swear his face lit up."
Ann Perkins,"What do you think ""We should get together soon"" means?"
Ann Perkins,"Um I think we should get a more basic, no nonsense beverage."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, more than ready."
Ann Perkins,"We've got dancing, Jello shots, private karaoke, and anything that can be penis shaped will be penis shaped."
Ann Perkins,Who is crazy.
Ann Perkins,He broke up with me.
Ann Perkins,"You should've told me, because we gave you anesthesia at the hospital."
Ann Perkins,"Also, I just read Brooke Shields' book on postpartum depression."
Ann Perkins,My stomach has so many stretch marks on it that it looks like an old-fashioned globe.
Ann Perkins,And it's not like you and I always see eye to eye.
Ann Perkins,Take care of yourself.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, Friday Night Lights?"
Ann Perkins,"I am more of a Riggins girl, and you lean Saracen."
Ann Perkins,He took the fall for his brother.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I'm not having this conversation with you again."
Ann Perkins,The point is we didn't always like the same stuff when we first became friends.
Ann Perkins,Just don't force it.
Ann Perkins,Give it some time.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"All right, so we don't have to fact check anymore."
Ann Perkins,"I didn't know that, no."
Ann Perkins,But Leslie wants us to be on ready alert one just in case something comes up.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I think I'm just gonna hang out here with you guys, if that's cool."
Ann Perkins,"But then, she went right back to sleep."
Ann Perkins,"I want to be a giant head and a mouth, and I just want to eat rows and rows of junk food pellets, and where's my trash bag of potatoes?"
Ann Perkins,I've been monitoring her vital signs.
Ann Perkins,"I want to be PacMan, and instead of dots, I want 'em to be cinnamon buns."
Ann Perkins,"No, dummy."
Ann Perkins,II thought you said he gained weight in the last three months.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,And I'm never not hungry.
Ann Perkins,"And I know Donna and April don't show it, but they would do anything for you."
Ann Perkins,Call if you need us.
Ann Perkins,"I can't have cheese, Larry!"
Ann Perkins,And I can't have wine either.
Ann Perkins,We are leaving.
Ann Perkins,I can't have anything good.
Ann Perkins,"You know, what I can have is liquefied flaxseed."
Ann Perkins,But I don't want that.
Ann Perkins,You know what I want?
Ann Perkins,Pork rinds.
Ann Perkins,I want jelly beans.
Ann Perkins,And I want a huge trash bag filled with mashed potatoes.
Ann Perkins,Just you.
Ann Perkins,"Well, you're here now, so let's talk."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, sure."
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,Thank you for catching him up on our history.
Ann Perkins,When?
Ann Perkins,"I haven't pricked you, yet."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, but we should talk soon, 'cause I almost bought a toe ring the other day."
Ann Perkins,But I'm not going to.
Ann Perkins,Why are you hanging out with Chris?
Ann Perkins,"I will get my one minute of small talk, damn it."
Ann Perkins,I have been having so much fun just dating a bunch of people.
Ann Perkins,"And it will be casual, and it will be amicable!"
Ann Perkins,You don't want to know.
Ann Perkins,"No, he's not."
Ann Perkins,"All right, man, you asked for it."
Ann Perkins,Course I do.
Ann Perkins,I have shooting pains that go all the way up from my butt to my neck.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we did."
Ann Perkins,I asked you for one thing.
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,It'll be fun.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you stop it right now!"
Ann Perkins,I could leave.
Ann Perkins,Stop it!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I could.
Ann Perkins,I'll help you set up a profile.
Ann Perkins,My boobs are getting really sore.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no!"
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"Still haven't done it, yet."
Ann Perkins,You told them.
Ann Perkins,You were drunk?
Ann Perkins,Have you thought about Internet dating?
Ann Perkins,Maybe you need to cast a wider net.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Didn't need to tell me that.
Ann Perkins,Saying his name over and over again is not going to help me.
Ann Perkins,The recount's over.
Ann Perkins,They just called the race.
Ann Perkins,"Reminder, Leslie, we have less than an hour to get the ad to the station."
Ann Perkins,It's still 21 votes.
Ann Perkins,But you won.
Ann Perkins,"You won, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,You won by 21 votes.
Ann Perkins,It's confirmed.
Ann Perkins,It's over.
Ann Perkins,You won.
Ann Perkins,Are you joking?
Ann Perkins,Stink bomb?
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I couldn't resist.
Ann Perkins,I do.
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, God!"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, no."
Ann Perkins,"If this is ever going to work, we have to pretend to disapprove."
Ann Perkins,"What about us, Tom?"
Ann Perkins,What are you talking about?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, I forgot to ask you."
Ann Perkins,What are you cooking?
Ann Perkins,I wasn't offering my sympathy.
Ann Perkins,I can't imagine a more depressing place to be.
Ann Perkins,"Well It's Valentine's Day, and I'm single, and I'm at a couples dance."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Of what?
Ann Perkins,This is good.
Ann Perkins,We're fighting for our lives out there.
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with you?
Ann Perkins,Excuse us.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, remember."
Ann Perkins,"78% of Pawneeans label our parks ""pristine."""
Ann Perkins,"Definitely, you should talk to him."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, he's just right over there."
Ann Perkins,Tom Haverford my needless shopping phase.
Ann Perkins,Wait!
Ann Perkins,Aww.
Ann Perkins,Also my credit card debt phase.
Ann Perkins,Leslie said you still need to pay for the permit.
Ann Perkins,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, come on."
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,Right?
Ann Perkins,Of what?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,You broke up with me.
Ann Perkins,It is amazing.
Ann Perkins,Yay.
Ann Perkins,The baby is Tom.
Ann Perkins,Andy Dwyer my grunge phase.
Ann Perkins,Chris Traeger exercise phase.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's maybe not talk about that part right now."
Ann Perkins,The evidence is fairly damning.
Ann Perkins,I really do.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's my Chris Traeger box."
Ann Perkins,That's such a cute idea!
Ann Perkins,All these boxes represent stuff from different eras of exboyfriends.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Ron!"
Ann Perkins,"Recently Leslie pointed out that sometimes when I date someone, I kind of adopt that person's personality."
Ann Perkins,It's 28 dollars.
Ann Perkins,"Once again, they are my biological children."
Ann Perkins,"Honey, look at this."
Ann Perkins,and we can decorate our offices with candy canes and gumdrops!
Ann Perkins,I don't want a ring.
Ann Perkins,I don't want a wedding.
Ann Perkins,I just want this locket with a picture of our child in it.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we've never been traditional."
Ann Perkins,Better idea: We make a gingerbread version of the office.
Ann Perkins,We made out the first night we ever met.
Ann Perkins,This is what I want.
Ann Perkins,This is easily my favorite painting ever.
Ann Perkins,We're not together any more because you keep acting like an ass.
Ann Perkins,But take your time.
Ann Perkins,Zero.
Ann Perkins,Just once.
Ann Perkins,Ready and Boo!
Ann Perkins,"Yes! Yeah, we have it."
Ann Perkins,We had it seven hours ago.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, right-- that's why I dated him."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, I think he might be having a heart attack."
Ann Perkins,Can we just stop off at the lobby because the prison gift bags are amazing.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, call 911."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Just breathe, okay?"
Ann Perkins,You're gonna be fine.
Ann Perkins,"Stop talking, moron."
Ann Perkins,It's stunning.
Ann Perkins,"And just for the record, I'm starting to hate you, too."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that makes me feel weird too."
Ann Perkins,"But you shouldn't take it out on Andy, because he really likes you, and he did nothing wrong."
Ann Perkins,You want to hate me forever?
Ann Perkins,I will.
Ann Perkins,Can I talk to you for a second?
Ann Perkins,What happened to you?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you know what, I don't even want it anymore."
Ann Perkins,Let's go wait outside the bathroom for Tom and scare him.
Ann Perkins,What on earth would make you think I would like that?
Ann Perkins,"Three, two, one."
Ann Perkins,And my shift's over.
Ann Perkins,What the [bleep] is your problem?
Ann Perkins,"Well I was on duty, I didn't."
Ann Perkins,Now it's just me.
Ann Perkins,"I get that you're mad that I kissed Andy, okay? But it was a moment of confusion, and it was a mistake."
Ann Perkins,And I'm very sorry.
Ann Perkins,Fine! You know what? I don't care.
Ann Perkins,Maybe we should.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know anymore."""
Ann Perkins,I changed my shift.
Ann Perkins,It's from the pills I was telling you about.
Ann Perkins,You're free to go.
Ann Perkins,"No, you're supposed to crack them and leave them on your hair overnight."
Ann Perkins,Not eat them.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Ron, we posted bail."
Ann Perkins,"You left, and you said you were gonna work late, and I kissed you?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I don't know when he has time to make it.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, Tom! Why do you have to be so ""you"" all the time?"
Ann Perkins,That guy is scary when he's angry.
Ann Perkins,"Well, hello again."
Ann Perkins,"You ready to be nice to Jerry? Because it's so cold out here, it reminds me of my wife's lasagna."
Ann Perkins,Leslie? What are you doing here? Why aren't you sleeping?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, did that happen to you?"
Ann Perkins,"Boutique eye cream, unisex cologne, lip exfoliator, chocolate covered almonds, and a Sudoku book just amenities everywhere!"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thank you."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is always here."
Ann Perkins,And then I wanted you to meet my parents?
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm so sorry."
Ann Perkins,I diagnosed two melanomas.
Ann Perkins,They're both benign.
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, I gotta go."
Ann Perkins,This is humiliating.
Ann Perkins,He's great.
Ann Perkins,He should be out of here in a day or two.
Ann Perkins,I did.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,I don't know!
Ann Perkins,"You know what? I have some champagne, back at the office."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, you should really come over here and look at Jerry's painting."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I think maybe not."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"The gala's over, they're taking it all down."
Ann Perkins,"Well, at least the music seems about right."
Ann Perkins,I think we missed it.
Ann Perkins,"Let's go back there, have a drink, toast to Pawnee Commons."
Ann Perkins,"And then I said that I would move to Indianapolis if I had to, and you said you didn't wanna make me do that, and then you said that in a different world... Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Sorry to bother you.
Ann Perkins,God.
Ann Perkins,Phhhht! Totally.
Ann Perkins,Sorry it's a little bit lame right now.
Ann Perkins,But we'll get it going.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,It's... Just come in before anybody Leslie and I had an amazing talk.
Ann Perkins,It was so great of her to come over here.
Ann Perkins,Even though she was exhausted beyond belief.
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, after we talked, she fell asleep on my couch."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Check this out.
Ann Perkins,And she's been asleep for 22 hours.
Ann Perkins,It's amazing what she slept through.
Ann Perkins,"No take-backs, partner."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys!"
Ann Perkins,How's it going in here?
Ann Perkins,Awesome.
Ann Perkins,Who needs a drink?
Ann Perkins,It's totally okay that you didn't wear a costume.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Dr. Harris."
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Ann Perkins,I'm so embarrassed.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"Um, this is Ron Swanson, from the Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,I know him from that thing that I'm doing.
Ann Perkins,This is Dr. Harris.
Ann Perkins,"Worlds colliding, always awkward."
Ann Perkins,You did.
Ann Perkins,"Tommy! This party was amazing, you're amazing."
Ann Perkins,"You are ridiculous, but I like you, and I think that we should date, all of it."
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.
Ann Perkins,Let's date.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, hi."
Ann Perkins,"I am so sorry, honey."
Ann Perkins,I do.
Ann Perkins,No way.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Leslie found a pink razor and a pink swimming cap in your shower.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, come on, 60 dollars?"
Ann Perkins,Whose pink razor's in your shower?
Ann Perkins,Ohh.
Ann Perkins,65 dollars anybody?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, we're up to 60 dollars, not bad, right?"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I won't.
Ann Perkins,"I have an idea, and it might be insane, but I've been watching a lot Project Runway recently In the past eight years."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, April."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you're underage."
Ann Perkins,I know that he's Donna's cousin.
Ann Perkins,I'm so happy to see you.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Whose is it?
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,55 dollars
Ann Perkins,We're cowboys.
Ann Perkins,"At one point, I thought she was upâ¦"
Ann Perkins,What's going on right here?
Ann Perkins,Hold on.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's totally fine."
Ann Perkins,And the swimming cap?
Ann Perkins,Was that Andy?
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,I know you're in there because I can see you through the screen.
Ann Perkins,Thank you for coming.
Ann Perkins,I can see that.
Ann Perkins,Would you like some water?
Ann Perkins,It's the best part.
Ann Perkins,Night and day.
Ann Perkins,Do you live down here?
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"Mr. Hotate, hi."
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,It was one of my favorite books when I was a kid.
Ann Perkins,Raggedy Ann.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, slutty teenage girls dressed as sexy kittens, pump your own stomachs this year."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, one more thing, the people in this room now are the people I invited, plus Leslie and Donna, so, don't tell anybody."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Who?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, you're coming?"
Ann Perkins,I was just about to tell you.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,Who didn't know?
Ann Perkins,7:00
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's perfect."
Ann Perkins,I know!
Ann Perkins,That looks like something you would find on the wall of a serial killer.
Ann Perkins,"This guy's in it, too."
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,I've never dated anyone who loves giving vaccinations.
Ann Perkins,And I don't have to work.
Ann Perkins,"Halloween is my favorite holiday, it's just the best."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Cool.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Herb."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Is it okay?
Ann Perkins,What do you think?
Ann Perkins,"I gathered up all the meaningful bills, pictures, documents, and memos from your career."
Ann Perkins,"You know, maybe they really like each other."
Ann Perkins,He totally called that.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"But most importantly, you say the word, and I will beat her senseless with a baseball bat."
Ann Perkins,"He did, actually."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you said that you didn't wanna leave Pawnee and that I was the most amazing woman you had ever met."
Ann Perkins,"Second of all, this whole fence thing, she's obviously just trying to get a rise out of you."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, just to remind you, tonight, 7 o' clock, my house, in costume. Everybody in?"
Ann Perkins,"Third of all, she knows she only got the job because you turned it down which must drive her nuts."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, gross."
Ann Perkins,Weird question for you.
Ann Perkins,"What's the big deal, anyway?"
Ann Perkins,Half.
Ann Perkins,"Like, can you fix things?"
Ann Perkins,My shower.
Ann Perkins,"""The soda tax is good and will help people get healthier."""
Ann Perkins,"It's leaky, low pressure, just all around terrible."
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Amazing.
Ann Perkins,I was scared that you were cheating on me.
Ann Perkins,"I will cook you a cheap, quick dinner that will be no trouble at all for me."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,We're not taxing anyone's genitals.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,"Nope, you are right on time."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks."
Ann Perkins,She has.
Ann Perkins,"She is the next city councilwoman from the great city of Pawnee, ladies and gentlemen, my best friend in the world, Leslie Knope."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, ""the soda tax is bad and unfair to consumers."""
Ann Perkins,And I know all of you know how hard she worked to get here.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, a kid TPs some statue."
Ann Perkins,He's the little fat baby.
Ann Perkins,That guy Mark and the reporter.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Well, if you destroy him early, please come by."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann.
Ann Perkins,Are you handy?
Ann Perkins,You're kidding.
Ann Perkins,So how'd it go?
Ann Perkins,Come on in.
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm home."
Ann Perkins,"Of course I remember, but we didn't break up."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,"She didn't ask about Andy being drunk, did she?"
Ann Perkins,"Wear loose pants! I gotta tell you, Ron."
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Ann Perkins,Yep.
Ann Perkins,I'll handle this.
Ann Perkins,"The monitor is not a toy, Andy."
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet."
Ann Perkins,I'll chalk that up to your concussion.
Ann Perkins,The good news is your CAT scan's clear.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, nice to meet you."
Ann Perkins,Pistol Pete Disellio will be here in five minutes.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie was worried, too."
Ann Perkins,We should've checked before to see if you were home.
Ann Perkins,Can I ask you a question?
Ann Perkins,I did.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Beat it, Donna."
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I'm really happy you're okay."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, my iPod!"
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,I agree.
Ann Perkins,Is it dangerous?
Ann Perkins,"There was a girl at my prom who was known as ""the back ho."""
Ann Perkins,Mary Dunbar.
Ann Perkins,She'd let anyone massage her back.
Ann Perkins,I'll take that one.
Ann Perkins,But it-- It fell off.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"It's not awesome, Andy."
Ann Perkins,It's not broken.
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,Come on in.
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, you're fine."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,What are we doing?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, that's exactly the question."
Ann Perkins,And back down.
Ann Perkins,Holy crap!
Ann Perkins,"All right, Leslie, what's your call?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Looking good.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"So, I brought you some clean clothes that I found at my house."
Ann Perkins,No problem.
Ann Perkins,"Well, then, why don't you just come here and do it yourself?"
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie?"
Ann Perkins,What do you want me to do?
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,What... What are you... What do you think is happening right now?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks, that's because I googled ""campaign manager"" and noticed that they wear a lot of dark colors."
Ann Perkins,"Andy, we're not back together."
Ann Perkins,You know that I'm kind of with Mark now.
Ann Perkins,You're welcome.
Ann Perkins,Scooch up for one sec.
Ann Perkins,That will not be necessary.
Ann Perkins,It's kind of hard to casually bring up the Parks budget when you're talking about your favorite movies.
Ann Perkins,There you go.
Ann Perkins,"But I'm seeing this new guy, Mattias."
Ann Perkins,"This big, beefy dude just came into the first aid tent because he was dehydrated, and then, a reporter came in and asked if it was because of the curse."
Ann Perkins,You would love him.
Ann Perkins,How about this?
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna get a male doctor to come in and do some screenings.
Ann Perkins,He's a triple Pisces.
Ann Perkins,I told you I'm rusty.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Well, this sucks."
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Ann Perkins,Play hooky!
Ann Perkins,Like a rock arena kind of thing?
Ann Perkins,He's actually a really nice guy.
Ann Perkins,"It's a date, you know?"
Ann Perkins,I think it's going well.
Ann Perkins,What's the occasion?
Ann Perkins,"No, you're not."
Ann Perkins,"Of course, I'll do anything I can to help."
Ann Perkins,I think that would be great.
Ann Perkins,"And the only problem I see is that your potassium's low, so just eat a banana once in awhile."
Ann Perkins,You live in a pit.
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,You are wonderful and amazing and I'm happy to be here with you.
Ann Perkins,That's oddly beautiful but also stupid.
Ann Perkins,You are free to go.
Ann Perkins,"You're not alone in the world anymore, Ron."
Ann Perkins,"You're dating a woman who has two kids, so every three days, think about Ivy and Zoe and Diane, and eat a damn banana."
Ann Perkins,"I can see that, but--"
Ann Perkins,"It's been a stressful day, and he's had a really rough life."
Ann Perkins,He is driving me crazy with these stupid questions.
Ann Perkins,It's like I'm dating some idiotic game show host.
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with Tom?
Ann Perkins,Hello?
Ann Perkins,Or you could stay here and make out with me until the lights come back on.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you're all set."
Ann Perkins,And how exactly am I supposed to casually steer the conversation towards the Parks Department budget?
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry I'm not a professional model.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,I got your text.
Ann Perkins,"Or, like, a metal bikini?"
Ann Perkins,"Didn't you just plan this, like, two hours ago?"
Ann Perkins,Who'da thunk?
Ann Perkins,It's really not that big of a pit.
Ann Perkins,"What about if I wear this normal, sane outfit?"
Ann Perkins,For dinner?
Ann Perkins,Not until we go over your test results and your blood work.
Ann Perkins,Your blood pressure looks fine.
Ann Perkins,"He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there."
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure how this is possible, but your cholesterol is 120, which is the lowest I've ever seen."
Ann Perkins,So I would have to call him from a weird number.
Ann Perkins,Is everything okay?
Ann Perkins,"So, Andy jumped over this fence."
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.
Ann Perkins,"I could prep, like, a thousand diagnostic tests."
Ann Perkins,"There it is, the pit."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I don't see them.
Ann Perkins,I support you.
Ann Perkins,"I know it's a little lame, but I bought a dozen eggs at the grocery store, and I thought we could do that thing where we pretend the egg is a kid for a day."
Ann Perkins,"Well, look, this is not the only way to see if we would be good parents."
Ann Perkins,Get off me!
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I know."
Ann Perkins,I left them at the grocery store.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, right, because of the dream you had?"
Ann Perkins,Where are you?
Ann Perkins,What's up?
Ann Perkins,"But for whatever reason, right now, only douchey guys are buying what you're selling."
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,"You should do it, and you should ask your friend to help you, because your friend totally has your back."
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,And that friend is me.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,In an hour.
Ann Perkins,"I bought 12 babies, and then I immediately abandoned them at a Kroger's."
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,There's something I wish I could kaboom.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Totally.
Ann Perkins,See you tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, guys."
Ann Perkins,Tonight at 8:00.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Does it hurt a lot?
Ann Perkins,"We're not leaving, okay? We're the reason Leslie's in this mess."
Ann Perkins,We're going to stay here and we're going to go out there as a team.
Ann Perkins,I'm not sure which one is the insult.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, are you okay?"
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,Can I get you a drink?
Ann Perkins,I love every single beverage in the world.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, squeeze my fingers."
Ann Perkins,It's our mess.
Ann Perkins,It's obvious what you need to do.
Ann Perkins,Blow off the meeting.
Ann Perkins,He's ridiculous.
Ann Perkins,"I said, ""Hey, Andy."""
Ann Perkins,"""It's Ann."""
Ann Perkins,""" Can we talk at my house?"""
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April, Matlock called."
Ann Perkins,I think I may actually like Chris.
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Ann Perkins,I think I know who I'm bidding against.
Ann Perkins,He wants his cardigan back.
Ann Perkins,Ugh! Literally.
Ann Perkins,"Big, naked baby."
Ann Perkins,Put clothes on.
Ann Perkins,That is horrifying.
Ann Perkins,You know what? I should have seen this coming.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you are such a baby."
Ann Perkins,"Anniversaries, birthdays, holidays."
Ann Perkins,"No, I actually meant more like a one-on-one thing."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,What's your occupation?
Ann Perkins,"Is that a happy ""Ann Perkins,"" or is that a bad-news ""Ann Perkins""?"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, the man lived in a pit."
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"He couldn't find a place to live on the Earth's surface, so he went under the ground."
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Ann Perkins,You're dealing with a grown man who thinks like a gopher.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"If you're kidding, you suck, but if you're serious, I actually have been thinking about it."
Ann Perkins,We need to talk somewhere private.
Ann Perkins,Why are you naked?
Ann Perkins,Presenting the amazing spoutless fountain.
Ann Perkins,"Andy's playing a show tonight, and we'd love it if you came by."
Ann Perkins,"No, we're not."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Dr. Harris."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Good luck.
Ann Perkins,He wrote this new song about what happened to him called The Pit.
Ann Perkins,Fine.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"You're going to stay here, and you're going to help."
Ann Perkins,And thank God an opportunity presented itself.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you have."
Ann Perkins,Dude!
Ann Perkins,Rocky.
Ann Perkins,I guess.
Ann Perkins,Everyone loves a good comeback story.
Ann Perkins,Cause I just finished a 12 hour shift.
Ann Perkins,"So I don't care what you say, you're my friend."
Ann Perkins,"I can't tell if you actually hate me or if this is just how you are, but I had fun hanging out with you."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Is it good?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,So Leslie and I have come up with the theme for the campaign relaunch rally.
Ann Perkins,If that's the reason--
Ann Perkins,I think there's gonna be a good turnout at Andy's show tonight.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so, the rally's going to be held tomorrow at the Pawnee Sports Building."
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,That's so great.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I'm actually here to see Mark."
Ann Perkins,We're gonna hug now.
Ann Perkins,What is?
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"And I hope you get into veterinary school because I like you, so there."
Ann Perkins,That's also for Mark.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's a little shaky still, but that's to be expected."
Ann Perkins,Boom!
Ann Perkins,A baby-naming book.
Ann Perkins,"Oh um, that's because I didn't give them to you."
Ann Perkins,I'm out.
Ann Perkins,He was really sweet though. I'm just gonna see if maybe he wants to grab some
Ann Perkins,"April, you finalized a rental, right?"
Ann Perkins,"It's one of those rare songs that rocks really hard, and also informs people about a small public works project."
Ann Perkins,All that dumb swagger.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, this is so great."
Ann Perkins,No way.
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Ann Perkins,"Ha, ha."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, where are you going?"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, stay still."
Ann Perkins,Stay down.
Ann Perkins,Being pregnant is great.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, all three."
Ann Perkins,There's nothing wrong with you.
Ann Perkins,I think you should stop.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, no, I have to barf!"
Ann Perkins,"Wait, no, I have to pee."
Ann Perkins,I'm starving.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I don't know."
Ann Perkins,I'm not going to beat him.
Ann Perkins,Let's get some food.
Ann Perkins,"What does anyone want? Just a nice, funny guy who likes me and treats me well."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, fine."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"You're an intelligent, classy, attractive woman."
Ann Perkins,"Well, maybe just have him over and cook him some chicken and tell him it's Pawnee cockatoo."
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Ann Perkins,Everything.
Ann Perkins,"He has, literally, everything you don't have."
Ann Perkins,"A job, a car, a steady income, an address, a second pair of shoes, table manners, the ability to say ""tampon"" without giggling."
Ann Perkins,Mark has his life together.
Ann Perkins,I couldn't hear you.
Ann Perkins,I'll get you a different nurse.
Ann Perkins,what the hell is Jerry Dinner?
Ann Perkins,Not sure that that's true.
Ann Perkins,Stupid Internet.
Ann Perkins,"If this were the '80s, all we'd have to do is, like, not drop an egg for a whole day."
Ann Perkins,At least until you apologize to Bobby in person.
Ann Perkins,My fertility counselor showed me this online quiz that determines whether we'd be compatible parents.
Ann Perkins,"I wanna have a baby, and Chris has agreed to be the father."
Ann Perkins,You can win at anything.
Ann Perkins,You can't win this.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, our official coparenting score is 58% compatibility. Not amazing."
Ann Perkins,I'm so happy.
Ann Perkins,That'll be fun.
Ann Perkins,"Well, after yesterday's hands on brainstorming session"
Ann Perkins,What kind of name is Tiereeon anyway?
Ann Perkins,What's up?
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm actually having a good time with everyone."
Ann Perkins,Chris?
Ann Perkins,Fair enough.
Ann Perkins,We think we came up with a fountain idea that really works.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"I just keep getting outbid by someone named ""Tall Tiereeon Lannister."""
Ann Perkins,You do?
Ann Perkins,We love you.
Ann Perkins,I was just ribbing you.
Ann Perkins,Friends.
Ann Perkins,Don't make me change my mind.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not."
Ann Perkins,"Also, you called the dead man a jerk."
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Ann Perkins,Chris Traeger.
Ann Perkins,"You guys, that's so mean."
Ann Perkins,This is the perfect present.
Ann Perkins,"She always tells me not to, but then she buys me something that's awesome and thoughtful, and then I feel terrible."
Ann Perkins,Or maybe yes?
Ann Perkins,"What, no."
Ann Perkins,Damn it!
Ann Perkins,"No, right?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,It is not.
Ann Perkins,You should at least invite Jerry to the dinner.
Ann Perkins,But that's the thing.
Ann Perkins,JJ's diner put an old waffle iron up for auction.
Ann Perkins,Leslie has anniversaries for everything.
Ann Perkins,"""Zoo day,"" first time we went to the zoo together."
Ann Perkins,"""Double date day,"" it was the first time we went on a double date."
Ann Perkins,"""Daniel DayLewis day."""
Ann Perkins,"""Talk like a pirate day""."
Ann Perkins,"Talk like a Pittsburgh pirate day,"" which why and how?"
Ann Perkins,This calendar was last year's calendar day present celebrating the first time she ever bought me a calendar.
Ann Perkins,It's the perfect breakfast day gift for Leslie.
Ann Perkins,You have to apologize to Bobby and stop campaigning.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,"Aw, tiny dresses, braids, glitter on everything?"
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street."
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Ann Perkins,That'll teach you to pay attention.
Ann Perkins,"No, it's a problem."
Ann Perkins,It almost killed my boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Go.
Ann Perkins,"There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs."
Ann Perkins,"These are even worse, somehow."
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Why not just build the park on the lot behind my house?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,What about the ones we took on the swing? The normal ones?
Ann Perkins,I look miserable.
Ann Perkins,It's completely blurry.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Ann Perkins,Ham.
Ann Perkins,I just wanted to say--
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,How did the breakup go?
Ann Perkins,"Wow, you opposite of broke up with him."
Ann Perkins,"Hi, hi."
Ann Perkins,"That's not how this ends, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's a ridiculous claim."
Ann Perkins,""" Oh, my dude, what the hell?"
Ann Perkins,We'll have the rest of your test results in about 20 minutes.
Ann Perkins,Cholesterol
Ann Perkins,"Just please don't use these, okay? Let's grab some dinner."
Ann Perkins,He was being really annoying.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I had just gotten off a long shift."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,I wanted to thank you all for being so supportive.
Ann Perkins,He isn't exactly boyfriend material.
Ann Perkins,Him?
Ann Perkins,"You know there's nothing in there yet, right?"
Ann Perkins,This is really happening.
Ann Perkins,I'm so sorry.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,I'm pregnant.
Ann Perkins,Are you sure about this?
Ann Perkins,"Um, I don't think that's going to be a problem."
Ann Perkins,"So, are you happy to be back at work?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, wow! Two pizzas."
Ann Perkins,"We couldn't read your writing, and we need to know the sex of our baby."
Ann Perkins,That was notâ¦
Ann Perkins,The answer is yes.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"""Will you love our child and work hard to see that he or she has a good life?"""
Ann Perkins,I should not... I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,And toppings!
Ann Perkins,What did he tell you?
Ann Perkins,What does this--
Ann Perkins,"Can you just read that and tell us what the sex is, please?"
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Are you actually hitting on me right now?
Ann Perkins,I think I'm going to have to pass.
Ann Perkins,I'm prepping the medical tent.
Ann Perkins,What about those binders in your office?
Ann Perkins,I break up with him.
Ann Perkins,Look --
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Left.
Ann Perkins,"The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's government owned, and you need to do something about it."
Ann Perkins,Are you experiencing abdominal pain?
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,You aren't sick.
Ann Perkins,Is that a promise?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, okay."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Look right.
Ann Perkins,Eww.
Ann Perkins,I'm... I'm so sorry.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, you've been sweating in here all day."
Ann Perkins,"No, you need to drink water."
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, buddy, let's go get some breakfast, okay?"
Ann Perkins,He's been writing all these songs about things that are physically near him.
Ann Perkins,"Oh my God, April, that's horrible."
Ann Perkins,"Wait, is he gonna break up with me?"
Ann Perkins,You'll love him.
Ann Perkins,Take this.
Ann Perkins,"He's a rude, brash jerk."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Sexual history.
Ann Perkins,Allergies?
Ann Perkins,Do you have any history of mental illness in your family?
Ann Perkins,Do you exercise?
Ann Perkins,And we want you all to come.
Ann Perkins,"That's it, one drink?"
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go get your doctor.
Ann Perkins,How many drinks of alcohol do you consume a week?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, just the pancake breakfast is fine."
Ann Perkins,"Listen, man, I know you don't want to repeat the mistakes of Entertainment 720, and that's great, but you're gonna need a little bit of the old Tom to make this business work."
Ann Perkins,"I wasn't, right?"
Ann Perkins,You just hung up on her?
Ann Perkins,"God, I hope I wasn't as obnoxious as those people."
Ann Perkins,Whoa.
Ann Perkins,"A couple of weeks ago, I was yelling at Leslie at a public forum."
Ann Perkins,That's really helpful.
Ann Perkins,That was brutal.
Ann Perkins,"Andy's band is really good, and it's been driving him nuts that he can't play."
Ann Perkins,"""My mother's butt,"" really?"
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,Where are you?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, but if I don't, it's no big deal, right?"
Ann Perkins,You'll just make your speech?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I wasn't going to.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, he did, and that Tom made you a horrible boyfriend and a terrible employee and drove you to bankruptcy."
Ann Perkins,You can't have RentASwag without the swag.
Ann Perkins,Are you drinking any fluids?
Ann Perkins,We need you to give real answers.
Ann Perkins,"For ""date of birth,"" you wrote ""springtime."""
Ann Perkins,"I didn't know who to come to with this, but that picture, uhthere's something very disturbing about the testicles."
Ann Perkins,What about a layup?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I didn't.
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Ann Perkins,You swear you have no preference?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks."
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,I think I'm good for now.
Ann Perkins,I will honestly be happy either way.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
Ann Perkins,"So, thanks."
Ann Perkins,"When Andy fell in the pit, I didn't expect anyone in government to reach out to us."
Ann Perkins,That seems about right.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, this isn't safe."
Ann Perkins,"You need to take off those layers, rehydrate, and go to the doctor."
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna... Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Everything you write down is confidential.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"No, Leslie, yes, you are."
Ann Perkins,Andy's band is playing a show.
Ann Perkins,You redacted all the information.
Ann Perkins,Ron!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm just gonna doublecheck your form here."
Ann Perkins,Thank you?
Ann Perkins,"I think that maybe that guy is sick with something perhaps, a hernia, or mumps."
Ann Perkins,They're enlarged.
Ann Perkins,I just really wanted it to be a boy.
Ann Perkins,We all chipped in.
Ann Perkins,And in return you can give us like one share of stock in the company.
Ann Perkins,"No, I was speaking medically."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, wow."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,That's not going to work.
Ann Perkins,Alone without cameras.
Ann Perkins,All you need to do is stop the machine for a second and go apologize to Bobby.
Ann Perkins,Use it to spruce up the store.
Ann Perkins,You really let 'em have it.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Maybe you'll be reincarnated as a good dancer.
Ann Perkins,"Miss, hi, I'm pregnant, and I'm a little bit crazy, so if you don't bring our appetizers out in the next 30 seconds, I'm going to plunge your face into the deep fryer."
Ann Perkins,Yea.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, yea."
Ann Perkins,"You just wanna go back to saying ""yea""?"
Ann Perkins,Uhoh.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I heard it."
Ann Perkins,"Wait, what does that mean about you and Ben?"
Ann Perkins,Ooh.
Ann Perkins,I heard it.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I got Pistol Pete."
Ann Perkins,Yea!
Ann Perkins,I'm getting it.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, I'm starving."
Ann Perkins,He did.
Ann Perkins,"Right now, he's curled up in the back seat of my car, talking about his father, who is a piece of work."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, yea!"
Ann Perkins,Yea!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,It's the entire Sanitation Department for Muncie.
Ann Perkins,I just don't think I'm in a place to go out with anyone right now.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I did, too."
Ann Perkins,"This is what's going on, we're gonna have a drink, and we're gonna talk, get to know each other."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, this is so close to falling apart."
Ann Perkins,I just I couldn't deal with his face.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Just be direct and honest.
Ann Perkins,"Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit?"
Ann Perkins,Hmm.
Ann Perkins,'Cause they're gonna be here soon.
Ann Perkins,"That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit."
Ann Perkins,I think it's probably just a photo op for her.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about--"
Ann Perkins,"Look, I'm very flattered."
Ann Perkins,"But again, I don't think I should go out with you."
Ann Perkins,I'm talking about the pit you fell in.
Ann Perkins,Can-- Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm so beat."
Ann Perkins,He did.
Ann Perkins,Who were the suits?
Ann Perkins,Look at that.
Ann Perkins,Fifty burritos.
Ann Perkins,"Olive, Rosemary, Chicken."
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Tom!"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, hey."
Ann Perkins,Of course I do.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, I'm technically out of the country."
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Forget it.
Ann Perkins,I think you shouldn't whisper.
Ann Perkins,Is this fun for you?
Ann Perkins,"And screaming, ""Make your face better!"" doesn't help."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you look better."
Ann Perkins,I guess actual medicine can be effective.
Ann Perkins,I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April."
Ann Perkins,"I actually think he did the best he could for a single father, but I may be too close to the situation."
Ann Perkins,Mmmhmm.
Ann Perkins,"No, I was crying."
Ann Perkins,He is nothing if not persistent.
Ann Perkins,And hot.
Ann Perkins,He's very... He's pretty hot.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's hot."
Ann Perkins,But he's intense.
Ann Perkins,"But he's really, really hot."
Ann Perkins,But he's your boss.
Ann Perkins,"Man, this is tough."
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, the important news is that he's here."
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, I couldn't hear through all the crying."
Ann Perkins,I don't like it.
Ann Perkins,It's just sneaky.
Ann Perkins,"Definitely yes, then."
Ann Perkins,"No, that's not a real apology."
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,And then I am going to drive home alone.
Ann Perkins,"You have two broken bones in your right arm, and four in your hand."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, this was a mistake."
Ann Perkins,They still air that game every Friday night on cable access.
Ann Perkins,"Tell me more about that, Peter."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"It's kind of like old times, huh?"
Ann Perkins,Injured Andy.
Ann Perkins,I hope so.
Ann Perkins,My life is a motorcycle crash right now.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you're a living legend."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, that's what my whole week has been like."
Ann Perkins,Is something wrong?
Ann Perkins,Why can't you just keep sneaking around?
Ann Perkins,I'm calling Domino's.
Ann Perkins,Every color of Jell-O.
Ann Perkins,I brought you your favorite.
Ann Perkins,I cannot believe you haven't told him yet.
Ann Perkins,Maybe we're not dead.
Ann Perkins,Do you think Domino's delivers to this restaurant?
Ann Perkins,Mmhmm.
Ann Perkins,What are you gonna do?
Ann Perkins,I almost expect you to call me A-Cakes.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no!"
Ann Perkins,Maybe we shouldn't even be friends.
Ann Perkins,Are you sure? Everything we do makes it seem like it's a bad idea for us to have a kid together.
Ann Perkins,Sounds good.
Ann Perkins,"I know, I've been so busy at the hospital, long hours, overnight shifts, getting sick of it."
Ann Perkins,I think the danger in believing in reincarnation is that you spend so much time trying to figure out what you're going to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one you're in now.
Ann Perkins,Who?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, because now I have everyone in City Hall sending me pictures of their junk, asking me if they have mumps."
Ann Perkins,Oh It's emailing me too.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,How is this on me?
Ann Perkins,It would just mean so much to us.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad you're okay."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Did you maybe tell people that I diagnosed that guy with mumps based on his porn photo?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,The suspense is killing me!
Ann Perkins,I can't tell what's words and what's punctuation.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, look."
Ann Perkins,"Toy trucks, superhero costumes, tiny little acorn penis? Forget it."
Ann Perkins,That is accurate.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I told Leslie because she's my best friend, but if anybody finds out about this and they start jabbering, it's gonna make it really hard to know if this is actually anything, so just keep it on the DL, okay?"
Ann Perkins,There's just no other way.
Ann Perkins,Girl.
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, dude, you have to be cooler about this."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't want you to break up with him either."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we went out once, and nothing happened."
Ann Perkins,"But I'm sure that happens with a lot of couples, right?"
Ann Perkins,"So, Dr. Van Dyne, we took the compatibility test that you recommended, and we didn't do amazing."
Ann Perkins,I didn't tell you that?
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,What did you just call me?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"There is no ""this."
Ann Perkins,"No, it's just penises."
Ann Perkins,Definitely not.
Ann Perkins,Whatever.
Ann Perkins,"No, let's not."
Ann Perkins,Are we having a Smurf?
Ann Perkins,"Then it says, ""I leg Smurf."""
Ann Perkins,Ed Miller from payroll.
Ann Perkins,I think.
Ann Perkins,We've attacked this from all angles.
Ann Perkins,"It says ""Congratulations."""
Ann Perkins,Either you don't run for office
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we used to date actually, but it didn't work out because we had some compatibility issues."
Ann Perkins,Let me see that.
Ann Perkins,Or you break up with him and avoid a potential scandal.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,We broke up.
Ann Perkins,I'm ready.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,Teacher.
Ann Perkins,Whatever he wants.
Ann Perkins,No need to pretend to be my friend anymore.
Ann Perkins,"That's not the reason you called me in here, right?"
Ann Perkins,Definitely am.
Ann Perkins,Fired up.
Ann Perkins,That sounds nice.
Ann Perkins,We've been on a couple of dates.
Ann Perkins,I really like him.
Ann Perkins,"You're running for city council again, Leslie, with our help."
Ann Perkins,"Your campaign advisers quit, big deal."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, listen to me."
Ann Perkins,"You are smart and creative and talented, and you're gonna be fine."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Chris, how's it going?"
Ann Perkins,The problem is he's like a perfect human man.
Ann Perkins,There was one time I thought he farted.
Ann Perkins,But it was me.
Ann Perkins,"This newspaper's from November, 1986."
Ann Perkins,This is crazy.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, aren't we expecting like 300 people?"
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,How long has this been going on?
Ann Perkins,I can't find one flaw.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, obviously, the best way to prevent disease is to magically stop all sex, but that's not gonna happen."
Ann Perkins,"I love you, and I'll call you later."
Ann Perkins,Something came up.
Ann Perkins,You're awesome.
Ann Perkins,"This woman had agoraphobia and her therapist was obsessed with her, and he hid in her house."
Ann Perkins,"There was this one, How Far is Too Far Enough: The Teri Palliber Lonergan Story."
Ann Perkins,I'm kind of just fracking for friendship.
Ann Perkins,"Even though she hides it underneath layers of sarcasm, resentment, and grumpiness, I know, deep down somewhere, April likes me."
Ann Perkins,Definitely.
Ann Perkins,"I'm super, super excited."
Ann Perkins,"Ann Perkins, office manager and volunteer coordinator."
Ann Perkins,Build your perfect guy.
Ann Perkins,Looking forward to it.
Ann Perkins,I watch a lot of Lifetime movies.
Ann Perkins,"I guess it would have to be Channing Tatum's body, Ryan Gosling's face, and Michael Fassbender's sense of humor."
Ann Perkins,"I am a free woman, untaken, simply going about my business."
Ann Perkins,You wanna try that again?
Ann Perkins,"What's wrong, Andy?"
Ann Perkins,I just have to run.
Ann Perkins,What about you?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,That wasn't worth saying.
Ann Perkins,"It's fun, and I like it."
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just go home for the rest of the day?
Ann Perkins,Powerless.
Ann Perkins,You're dressed like an abstinence girl on the outside!
Ann Perkins,Why am I reading this?
Ann Perkins,"Uh, no, because you just approved the idea, like, three seconds ago."
Ann Perkins,"God, I'm off my comeback game right now."
Ann Perkins,So?
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, some of those things are symptoms and some of them are just being a person."
Ann Perkins,"I don't care, do whatever you want."
Ann Perkins,You know what might make you feel better?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Did you hit your head?
Ann Perkins,Paxil.
Ann Perkins,Do you want me to get you a prescription?
Ann Perkins,Can we get rid of it?
Ann Perkins,I'm from Michigan!
Ann Perkins,"Aww, thanks, Jeff."
Ann Perkins,What do you need this birdhouse for?
Ann Perkins,We made you this replica of the parks department out of gingerbread.
Ann Perkins,"Merry Christmas, Leslie!"
Ann Perkins,I think I need to call Child Services and have Leslie taken away from herself.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, don't take this the wrong way, but your house is like a crazy person's garage."
Ann Perkins,I'm Grateful.
Ann Perkins,"I guess the campaign's over, so I suppose it couldn't hurt."
Ann Perkins,Are we leaving?
Ann Perkins,Why are you doing this?
Ann Perkins,I get that.
Ann Perkins,I just You're not acting like yourself.
Ann Perkins,That is Walt Morphling.
Ann Perkins,"He was the director of public health, but he had to retire at 46 because he had diabetes."
Ann Perkins,Go where?
Ann Perkins,"No, I have no idea, honestly."
Ann Perkins,"I would like to shoot a new PSA and I think it'd be good to get someone who's healthy and telegenic, and I thought that you would be perfect."
Ann Perkins,You're gonna get up there and say a bunch of stuff you don't believe?
Ann Perkins,What about this one?
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,I got it at the dude ranch with my boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you've never had me over.
Ann Perkins,You like it?
Ann Perkins,Objective studies have shown that abstinenceonly education doesn't work.
Ann Perkins,People still have sex.
Ann Perkins,"Now, I can believe it."
Ann Perkins,Listen to me very carefully.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"They don't know how to use protection, so the disease keeps spreading."
Ann Perkins,"Well, you're on city council now."
Ann Perkins,I have not been taken.
Ann Perkins,Change the law.
Ann Perkins,Happy breakfast day.
Ann Perkins,So we're just gonna do the thing we know doesn't work?
Ann Perkins,Great plan.
Ann Perkins,"I know that's always your first fear when I'm not available, but this is not a Liam Neeson Taken scenario."
Ann Perkins,We need to give people practical knowledge.
Ann Perkins,You're officially first date proof.
Ann Perkins,I know!
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you gave him your home phone number.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, what day is it today?"
Ann Perkins,What the hell.
Ann Perkins,"So Leslie dragged you into this sneaky little fixup scheme, huh?"
Ann Perkins,"No, it's not."
Ann Perkins,He's really sweet.
Ann Perkins,"You're right, it is."
Ann Perkins,Well done.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Listen to you. I like Tom with a girlfriend.
Ann Perkins,What's what's up?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you."
Ann Perkins,You're like a scary Charlotte.
Ann Perkins,Sorry I had to get all medical on you.
Ann Perkins,"But now you see that even if everything goes wrong, you'll survive."
Ann Perkins,That's only for schools.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, April."
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Listen, it is impossible that he's not gonna like you."
Ann Perkins,"Also, no one's making me say this."
Ann Perkins,"So, yeah."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Also, her daughter was having sex way too young."
Ann Perkins,I think I'm just gonna cool it for a while.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I make some bad decisions sometimes at the end of long relationships."
Ann Perkins,It could literally shut down the entire system.
Ann Perkins,How about a week?
Ann Perkins,Shut up.
Ann Perkins,"My body's like a chip, too."
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,Nothing's gonna happen there.
Ann Perkins,We were fine with a week.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,And then he attacked her and tried to eat her toes.
Ann Perkins,A potato chip.
Ann Perkins,He's gonna freak out about how awesome you are.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you have to choose one."
Ann Perkins,We just can't keep up with all the anniversaries.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, he is."
Ann Perkins,He's gonna love you.
Ann Perkins,You're cool and you're sexy and you're funny and you're smartâ¦
Ann Perkins,"What's up now, mugger?"
Ann Perkins,"Look, any guy would be lucky to date you."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"It's too much, especially 'cause you're so good at them."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hells, yeah!"
Ann Perkins,I'm there.
Ann Perkins,Free self-defense class?
Ann Perkins,What's with the mask?
Ann Perkins,"No, I think you're a Charlotte."
Ann Perkins,You are awesome.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,How was your run?
Ann Perkins,I should tell him that.
Ann Perkins,That's a good band name.
Ann Perkins,How are you gonna do that?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Just turn around.
Ann Perkins,I didn't do this because of you.
Ann Perkins,"You are no longer my boss, and we can have a baby without being a conflict of interest."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,You were grinding with her pretty hard at April's Halloween party.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, that was definitely something."
Ann Perkins,Wait a second.
Ann Perkins,Clear sailing.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I know it was on sale, but it looks a lot like dried phlegm."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy, okay."
Ann Perkins,He was mugged in the park.
Ann Perkins,I was just dropping off Jerry from the hospital.
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, Chris."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna remind you that the reason you're not dating him is because you decided to run for city council.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm sure this is nothing."
Ann Perkins,Not too bad.
Ann Perkins,"So starting now, I am an employee of the County Health Board."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,You need a team of professionals to help.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,104.1
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you're dehydrated."
Ann Perkins,Chris.
Ann Perkins,My transfer was approved.
Ann Perkins,I'm admitting you.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,It's very flattering.
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
Ann Perkins,I heard you were back.
Ann Perkins,So you like the place?
Ann Perkins,Jerry who works with Leslie.
Ann Perkins,"I just, I just don't think it's a good idea."
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,Let's just go take a break for an hour or so.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,It feels wrong to leave it here.
Ann Perkins,Give it to me.
Ann Perkins,I panicked.
Ann Perkins,Run!
Ann Perkins,I'm just going to stay away from all guys right now.
Ann Perkins,"Amen, Gladys."
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,You're right!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's go."
Ann Perkins,"Not about the age thing, about the other thing."
Ann Perkins,That is a great idea!
Ann Perkins,I think you just described the Phantom of the Opera.
Ann Perkins,"You're joking, right?"
Ann Perkins,I have waited on him hand and foot for two months.
Ann Perkins,I thought you might like a fresh set of pillows.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,Do you really like this yellow paint?
Ann Perkins,"Um, okay."
Ann Perkins,There's so many pamphlets to look at.
Ann Perkins,Go time!
Ann Perkins,"Wait, what am I doing?"
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know you're stressed out, and I figured you would be, so I took the liberty of arranging a fun little activity for us."
Ann Perkins,I don't go with you.
Ann Perkins,You're definitely more charming.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"And often, she's already on her way over."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I'm just not ready to be your friend.
Ann Perkins,"You know what, Chris, I'm sorry, I'm not your nurse, and I'm not your girlfriend."
Ann Perkins,"Really, that's that's a question you wanted to ask me?"
Ann Perkins,Everyone needs a friend they can call and wake up in the middle of the night. Leslie's usually already up.
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Ann Perkins,"Chris, we don't have to do this today."
Ann Perkins,This was totally just sprung on us.
Ann Perkins,Let's just take a moment.
Ann Perkins,"And I thought I was twice and I was wrong, which was embarassing."
Ann Perkins,"I don't know how you landed that chick, but she's awesome."
Ann Perkins,"If all the parks are closed, why not just have the concert in the lot behind my house?"
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Can I help you at 11:48 p.m?
Ann Perkins,And that hand is usually giving me the finger or pouring honey in my purse.
Ann Perkins,"Generally, between us, April always has the upper hand."
Ann Perkins,We'll talk about it.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,Nurse.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, we used to live together."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I always had fun with Andy.
Ann Perkins,I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Ann Perkins,Where'd you get that?
Ann Perkins,Whoa!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, April, that's great!"
Ann Perkins,What's your secret?
Ann Perkins,"Good morning, April."
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,It was a lot.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it was amazing."
Ann Perkins,But now I have the upper hand.
Ann Perkins,I would be happy to write you that letter.
Ann Perkins,"""Baby in a Straightjacket."""
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,He's like a baby in a straightjacket.
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I can help you with cuts and bruises but the other stuff you're gonna have to see a real doctor."
Ann Perkins,He's completely helpless.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, smart ass, yes, you can."
Ann Perkins,And I'm going to use it to crush her Into being nice to me.
Ann Perkins,You have insurance.
Ann Perkins,"The problem is, when you're his girlfriend, you're also his mother, and his maid and his nurse."
Ann Perkins,Don't do that.
Ann Perkins,"No, you have to be my friend."
Ann Perkins,"But before I write you that letter, you have to spend the next week with me and do everything I say."
Ann Perkins,"Although, yes, we did hook up."
Ann Perkins,I don't hook up with everyone I know.
Ann Perkins,I actually know the guy who runs the veterinary program over there.
Ann Perkins,We're actually having a little town meeting tomorrow night if you wanted to just--
Ann Perkins,Leslie!
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Ann Perkins,This is Jerry Gergich calling.
Ann Perkins,I know that move.
Ann Perkins,"No, not right now."
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,I'm not going out with Chris again.
Ann Perkins,It's fine.
Ann Perkins,There's a chance I'm never gonna date anyone ever again.
Ann Perkins,"I get what this is, and why you did it."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"One time this guy rang my doorbell at midnight, to brag about getting laid when he was 16, so I shot him."
Ann Perkins,I think that you need to prepare for the eventuality that no one--
Ann Perkins,That's not bad.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know what you're talking about, but my gut says no."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Do you think anybody is going to show up?
Ann Perkins,"""Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?"""
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,That seems iffy.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, okay."
Ann Perkins,"Let's just pretend this didn't happen, okay?"
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"Just get out there and spin, man."
Ann Perkins,"Just when he gets there, can you text me and tell me he's back?"
Ann Perkins,Today?
Ann Perkins,"Like, today, today?"
Ann Perkins,Don't tell him that I called.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, you know what?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, just have Mr. Traeger call me when he gets back in."
Ann Perkins,How are people going to become fans if they literally don't know the name of the band they're listening to?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Uh-huh.
Ann Perkins,"Dude, you've got to stop doing that."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What the hell are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
Ann Perkins,That guy is everywhere.
Ann Perkins,Fine with me.
Ann Perkins,You were absolutely and totally right.
Ann Perkins,You can come in.
Ann Perkins,It's not weird.
Ann Perkins,Let's go out again.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, so the idea is to make a fountain that he can't do that to."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,You're the best.
Ann Perkins,You're gonna throw them on the roof again so I can't leave.
Ann Perkins,I just I'm gonna go home and watch TV.
Ann Perkins,That looks great.
Ann Perkins,I like you a lot.
Ann Perkins,"Will you be wearing it out of the store today, madame?"
Ann Perkins,Andy is our official waterfountain tester.
Ann Perkins,Shoot.
Ann Perkins,Have you?
Ann Perkins,Howdy.
Ann Perkins,"Well, then, say that."
Ann Perkins,I just got back from that dude ranch with Ricky.
Ann Perkins,It was really fun.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, for [Bleep] sake."
Ann Perkins,He bought this for me as a gift.
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, and I'm here to eat crow."
Ann Perkins,Leslie asked me to do her a favor.
Ann Perkins,"""You saved my life."""
Ann Perkins,"""I married Alf and we're pretty happy."""
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I wouldn't go with a cargo pant."
Ann Perkins,I don't know what that even is.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna just come by after work today?
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,"And I love her, so I did it."
Ann Perkins,Or you could just come over now?
Ann Perkins,I don't even work in this building.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Jerry?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, any ideas?"
Ann Perkins,I need anyone with a pulse and a brain to pitch in.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,That could work.
Ann Perkins,"And he looked up at me, and he said, ""Thank you."""
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go home.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Time you delivered her mail.
Ann Perkins,"if you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time if you fall, I will catch you time after time time after time time after time."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we get it."
Ann Perkins,"I know you don't care, dummy."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,We are gonna go to a restaurant and have a practice date.
Ann Perkins,"I will pretend to be Dave, and you will practice on me."
Ann Perkins,"You have a problem, and this is how we're gonna fix it."
Ann Perkins,200
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,You know this song already?
Ann Perkins,It's good to see you.
Ann Perkins,"Pawnee is looking for a new PR Director for the Health Department, and I submitted your name."
Ann Perkins,You don't wanna do that quite yet.
Ann Perkins,I care.
Ann Perkins,Whoa!
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,And you know what?
Ann Perkins,What's lucky is that I have a best friend who spent her Valentine's Day trying to find me a date.
Ann Perkins,"Just call him ""Ricky."""
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, relax."
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Ann Perkins,I have met a lot of different guys tonight.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Those are all insane hypotheticals.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay."
Ann Perkins,And I promise you they won't happen.
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
Ann Perkins,"Hello, Ben."
Ann Perkins,Seems like I love Leslie more than you do.
Ann Perkins,Get in line.
Ann Perkins,This computer could have found the future Mr. Leslie Knope.
Ann Perkins,He had his chance and he blew it.
Ann Perkins,You have to forget about Ben.
Ann Perkins,You told April you were breaking up with me?
Ann Perkins,You have an interview tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.
Ann Perkins,Cool.
Ann Perkins,What are you up to?
Ann Perkins,This is really happening.
Ann Perkins,"I made that profile, like, ten years ago."
Ann Perkins,I don't know how to change it.
Ann Perkins,The point is I'm getting that waffle iron for Leslie for breakfast day.
Ann Perkins,I just can't believe it.
Ann Perkins,You're in great shape.
Ann Perkins,You need to relax.
Ann Perkins,Stop bidding on my waffle iron.
Ann Perkins,Is that Andy?
Ann Perkins,"This is the celebration of the anniversary of the first time we hung out at JJ's, which she considers the beginning of our friendship."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, and maybe next time don't use the words ""medical emergency."""
Ann Perkins,He settled?
Ann Perkins,That might have something to do with it.
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, really."
Ann Perkins,I'm really sober!
Ann Perkins,"Please, Ben."
Ann Perkins,"Look, I have known her for longer, I have five years' worth of anniversaries, so I have seniority."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,No worries.
Ann Perkins,"Here is your letter of recommendation, so you're off the hook."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,What the hell.
Ann Perkins,I'm really fired up.
Ann Perkins,"You know they say that democracy or whatever only works when people get involved? Well, I'm getting involved."
Ann Perkins,So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.
Ann Perkins,Even if it takes two months.
Ann Perkins,It can wait.
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,And why did I believe that?
Ann Perkins,She just texted me from your phone and said she left her phone at home and that I should come here immediately.
Ann Perkins,Being alive?
Ann Perkins,Where's Leslie?
Ann Perkins,"That's how old you are, man."
Ann Perkins,Cool!
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"My taxes pay your salary, right?"
Ann Perkins,Have you been working out more than usual?
Ann Perkins,I think I need to break up with Mark.
Ann Perkins,"Eh, he kind of lives in a barn."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,But I think I do.
Ann Perkins,A lot of them seemed to hate a park yesterday.
Ann Perkins,"April, what's your idea?"
Ann Perkins,"Would you just go, dummy?"
Ann Perkins,"Swiss Army Watch, mofo."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"This will be fine, right?"
Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Andy."
Ann Perkins,"Andy came, too, to give his support."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Just having lunch with Leslie.
Ann Perkins,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next city councilor of the great city of Pawnee, Leslie Knope!"
Ann Perkins,Tom?
Ann Perkins,"You know, tendonitis is usually caused by overuse."
Ann Perkins,You like it?
Ann Perkins,He's dead.
Ann Perkins,What no.
Ann Perkins,"We've decided to fire the campaign manager, me."
Ann Perkins,"Wow, you did it."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Tyrion Lannister, why don't you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back?"
Ann Perkins,There's so much more to do.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, don't worry about it."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, really?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thank God."
Ann Perkins,"And I kept thinking about the question you asked me today, about whether or not he's the one."
Ann Perkins,And he's not.
Ann Perkins,This is why we don't hang out.
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, two weeks ago?"
Ann Perkins,He doesn't know what he's ready for.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, I'm just kidding, he's sleeping."
Ann Perkins,I've just been feeling for a while like something's missing.
Ann Perkins,"Also, seniors can be pretty ornery."
Ann Perkins,What's on the note cards?
Ann Perkins,"I can't believe I'm about to do this, but fine."
Ann Perkins,I didn't solve that problem.
Ann Perkins,"You make me see terrible movies, and then you talk through them."
Ann Perkins,April did.
Ann Perkins,"Because she's April, and she doesn't want you to think that she actually cares about something."
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,"No, I haven't."
Ann Perkins,"If you're looking for someone to help fill in for Leslie, April's a pain in the ass, but she's clearly the answer."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, how about my ""oh no nos"" for you?"
Ann Perkins,Should I go?
Ann Perkins,That's a soulmate level match.
Ann Perkins,"""You put 20 inch rims on your volkswagen golf, and you insist on being introduced as ""the brown Gosling."
Ann Perkins,A 98% match?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,So fun.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, guys."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, let's go put on our pj's and make White Russians."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't know the first thing about running a political campaign."
Ann Perkins,This is your penance.
Ann Perkins,This is weird.
Ann Perkins,I've never seen anything this high before.
Ann Perkins,That's crazy.
Ann Perkins,And that you think it might be fun to take it out on me.
Ann Perkins,Please don't do that.
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Ann Perkins,"You're so weak, really?"
Ann Perkins,You just hired me eight seconds ago.
Ann Perkins,Again?
Ann Perkins,Why are we on this bench?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I'm barely even doing anything."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, yes."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, he ran for mayor at 18 and won."
Ann Perkins,Are you iron deficient?
Ann Perkins,What about Ben?
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,Let me look at your palm.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, everyone."
Ann Perkins,Back to forced friendship.
Ann Perkins,Nothing's happening.
Ann Perkins,Maybe they'd have a little sympathy.
Ann Perkins,I should show them Andy's medical bills.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,It's been tough.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for asking.
Ann Perkins,"He broke up with me, but he did it so nicely that I didn't even realize he did it."
Ann Perkins,Chris?
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
Ann Perkins,"Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, were you going to tell us something?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I definitely wanna see you tonight."
Ann Perkins,"No, I can't really talk right now, 'cause I'm on a date with this drip."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I can ask."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, do you wanna watch a porno after this with me and my wife?"
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with people?
Ann Perkins,Do you want to talk in private?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Tiffany."
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna have to pass right now.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Donna."
Ann Perkins,"Bring 'em on, Tom."
Ann Perkins,How?
Ann Perkins,You can come in if you do something nice for Jerry.
Ann Perkins,That's what my mailman said.
Ann Perkins,"Nothing, never mind."
Ann Perkins,"You know, your basic bottoming out kind of stuff."
Ann Perkins,"No, talk to you later."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,You're right.
Ann Perkins,Or maybe some pancakes?
Ann Perkins,Do you want some more water?
Ann Perkins,"Andy, you should really just take it easy, I think."
Ann Perkins,Bought 700 dollars worth of candles from Anthropologie.
Ann Perkins,Unbelievable.
Ann Perkins,I've been looking at some dog adoption websites.
Ann Perkins,"Two days ago, I was sobbing at a pizza buffet, and they asked me to leave."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,I did this to my hair.
Ann Perkins,So the Health department is working on a poster campaign to warn people about diseases.
Ann Perkins,I get the sense that maybe you're angry at me for kissing Andy.
Ann Perkins,Stop lying.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"If you fall, I will catch you I'll be waitin'"
Ann Perkins,I'm calling this.
Ann Perkins,We're done.
Ann Perkins,"Well, with the elderly, we are not so concerned with pregnancy."
Ann Perkins,We're more concerned with disease.
Ann Perkins,"I don't think so, no."
Ann Perkins,Just ask me the first thing that comes to your head.
Ann Perkins,I know what you're thinking.
Ann Perkins,"People change, I guess."
Ann Perkins,You want to come into Jerry's party?
Ann Perkins,"Since when did he start doing stuff for other people? Now, I actually am worried that something happened to his brain."
Ann Perkins,And why is that?
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad you're feeling better."
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,This is a lovely party thrown by a lovely man and his lovely family.
Ann Perkins,"Well, well, well."
Ann Perkins,There's no place for meanies.
Ann Perkins,Costume?
Ann Perkins,Just ask me a question.
Ann Perkins,One date.
Ann Perkins,"""Whales, parades, electricity."""
Ann Perkins,But let me make one thing perfectly clear
Ann Perkins,And the rest are blank.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Leslie's in worse shape than I thought.
Ann Perkins,Is she practice laughing?
Ann Perkins,Just try to get to know me.
Ann Perkins,"And I can't stop thinking about it, and I'm obsessing about it, and I want to think about anything else but that, but it's making me crazy."
Ann Perkins,"I wanna have a baby, and I asked Chris to donate his sperm."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Wow, that's a thorough history of the teeter-totter."
Ann Perkins,"9 a.m., wow."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"You mean, like, scrubs?"
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"And he's taking a really long time to make up his mind, and it's really freaking me out."
Ann Perkins,There is a crazy flu going around.
Ann Perkins,"Lots of miserable, dehydrated people with high fevers and diarrhea."
Ann Perkins,"And one of those dehydrated, highfevered, miserable people is April."
Ann Perkins,Now we are going to build a better water fountain for the parks.
Ann Perkins,What's your niece's name?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Well, since I can't give her a waffle iron for breakfast day, I am making her a miniature Leslie out of breakfast food."
Ann Perkins,"You should never eat lube, you need to see a doctor immediately, and I'm sorry, sir, but you have to be under 40 to ride this train."
Ann Perkins,But he told me that you told him he should wait.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,God!
Ann Perkins,"That would be great, but whose holiday are we celebrating?"
Ann Perkins,Are you ready?
Ann Perkins,Yep.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Nurses and janitors are totally interchangeable.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I can't, though, because I'm married."
Ann Perkins,This is uncomfortable.
Ann Perkins,What should I do with this?
Ann Perkins,"Dude, whatever it is, I'm in."
Ann Perkins,"You're 20 minutes late, I almost left."
Ann Perkins,"So, I am going to immerse Leslie in a tank of bad date."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Who hates me.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,"Well, there are none."
Ann Perkins,Surprise! We felt really bad about the whole dredging up your past just to be publically humiliated thing.
Ann Perkins,And balloons.
Ann Perkins,We feel so bad.
Ann Perkins,Is there anything else we can do?
Ann Perkins,You're late.
Ann Perkins,And I can see your nipples through your dress.
Ann Perkins,"Water, a compress, aspirin, some lollipops, I know you love those."
Ann Perkins,"If you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time go."
Ann Perkins,I brought some stuff from the hospital.
Ann Perkins,We're stretched pretty thin right now.
Ann Perkins,I wanted to check in.
Ann Perkins,"In nursing school, we took a psych course on how to treat phobias with a method called ""exposure therapy."""
Ann Perkins,To sing.
Ann Perkins,"So, like, if you were afraid of snakes, they would immerse you in a tank of snakes."
Ann Perkins,"So, it's definitely a no?"
Ann Perkins,Nice work.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I brought a picnic blanket from your house."
Ann Perkins,Can you at least tell me what you're doing?
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Andy."
Ann Perkins,I think I got it.
Ann Perkins,Of course.
Ann Perkins,And Chris is missing life in a bigger city.
Ann Perkins,There.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,Not if I call you first.
Ann Perkins,And I just wanted to talk to you about it so you could hear it from me.
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Ann Perkins,Seems like the storm has passed.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, it's your birthday."
Ann Perkins,Do you hear that galloping?
Ann Perkins,I could use a beer.
Ann Perkins,Chris?
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Wha oh my, my look at that!"
Ann Perkins,Joe Biden on a horse shirtless.
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Ann Perkins,It's not a problem.
Ann Perkins,That's amazing!
Ann Perkins,"And, I'm not gonna talk about it."
Ann Perkins,I ended things with Mark a couple of days ago.
Ann Perkins,Justin!
Ann Perkins,I know for a fact this is a sex dream you've had.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"Well, it's not really code if you say his name."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Mm
Ann Perkins,That's awesome!
Ann Perkins,But I am ready to relax by the fire and get my Real Simple magazine on.
Ann Perkins,Sounds good.
Ann Perkins,"Um, I should probably change."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"I'm Ann, everyone."
Ann Perkins,It's just neither of us are from Pawnee.
Ann Perkins,"How dressy is this, exactly?"
Ann Perkins,And I have a whole family in Michigan.
Ann Perkins,"I don't really know Leslie's mom, and I don't know what the Tellenson Award is, but at this moment in my life, it sounds like a magical evening."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, look."
Ann Perkins,Andy being in a cast has definitely put a crimp in our social life.
Ann Perkins,I haven't been out in so long.
Ann Perkins,Friendship over.
Ann Perkins,I'm good.
Ann Perkins,That's why we formed the Leslie Knope emotional support task force.
Ann Perkins,That's all I wanted from you.
Ann Perkins,"All right, I got my park."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie's been holding it together pretty well, but today is when she needs us the most."
Ann Perkins,"One, two, three!"
Ann Perkins,Let's do this.
Ann Perkins,We wait for no man.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,It's just not your shape.
Ann Perkins,I thought it was gonna be gross.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it's pretty!"
Ann Perkins,There's Ron!
Ann Perkins,Here we are!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, gross."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's better."
Ann Perkins,Especially if you're going to I know.
Ann Perkins,"For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert."
Ann Perkins,Not exactly.
Ann Perkins,I want to be a mom.
Ann Perkins,I'm going to the sperm bank today.
Ann Perkins,April here was very apologetic on the phone.
Ann Perkins,Can you come?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Don't.
Ann Perkins,Stop.
Ann Perkins,Huh?
Ann Perkins,It's amazing.
Ann Perkins,Right here.
Ann Perkins,She also sent me flowers.
Ann Perkins,Did you wanna look through my nurse kit?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, girls!"
Ann Perkins,I thought kids liked ghost stories.
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did."
Ann Perkins,I love bears in bags.
Ann Perkins,Right here.
Ann Perkins,Aw!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,But it was actually a bloodhungry witch who was wearing their mom's face like a mask!
Ann Perkins,"Maybe, or maybe not."
Ann Perkins,"You hit the lottery with Ben, and that's great, but not everybody's so lucky."
Ann Perkins,"I've wanted to be a mom for a long time, I'm ready, and I think I'd be good at it."
Ann Perkins,My going away present to you will be that I do not make you audibly say that you love me.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, do you wanna maybe just talk for a minute? Let them work?"
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I'm gonna get you more beer."
Ann Perkins,It is so awesome. You are so awesome. I love you.
Ann Perkins,And it's a biggie.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, I know what my next activity is gonna be."
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Ann Perkins,"Ooh, check it out, bandages!"
Ann Perkins,"Come on, Leslie, just loosen up."
Ann Perkins,""" Hey, here you go."
Ann Perkins,I don't think I should do that.
Ann Perkins,I will have oatmeal and berries.
Ann Perkins,Your shift doesn't start for another six hours.
Ann Perkins,"And I will have catfish and grits, with pumpernickel toast."
Ann Perkins,It's 8:03.
Ann Perkins,"Well, instead of getting swept up in my boyfriends' personalities, I am dating myself and trying new things."
Ann Perkins,"So every time I go out to eat, I order one thing that's typical me and then something that I would never order."
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I also have been documenting all the new things I'm trying on my blog."
Ann Perkins,Check this out.
Ann Perkins,I went skydiving.
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, because I instantly blacked out from extreme terror."
Ann Perkins,It's not definite.
Ann Perkins,"I can watch them for a little while, if you wanna Take a break."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,It's free.
Ann Perkins,"Here, Zoe, watch."
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, or we can use this hammer and test reflexes."
Ann Perkins,"""Leslie, it's Leslie Knope from the Parks Department speaking to you through Ann Perkins, friend and beautiful nurse."""
Ann Perkins,That sounds fun.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"""Do not do anything with Ben."""
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Ann Perkins,"""Be responsible, no matter how cute his mouth is."""
Ann Perkins,"We can wrap up the dolls, and pretend they just had surgery."
Ann Perkins,"""Your job is on the line!"""
Ann Perkins,You wrote that.
Ann Perkins,"You know what, Ron?"
Ann Perkins,I don't work here.
Ann Perkins,A poster announcing the new Lilith Fair concert.
Ann Perkins,"It's fake, but it'll buy us an hour."
Ann Perkins,Should we try?
Ann Perkins,Yeah?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, I'm okay."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,I was told it was black tie.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, grab my computer."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's try."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,I'm all set.
Ann Perkins,Ben is fine.
Ann Perkins,I don't remember.
Ann Perkins,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Ann Perkins,I don't even know if it happened.
Ann Perkins,He says he's sorry he's not in here.
Ann Perkins,He said to look at the monster.
Ann Perkins,I just had this feeling when I woke up this morning like I definitely kissed somebody.
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,Try.
Ann Perkins,Just enjoy.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,They even said they wanted to be doctors when they grow up.
Ann Perkins,There we go.
Ann Perkins,"Really different from your Friday night crowd, right?"
Ann Perkins,Mmmhmm.
Ann Perkins,That's all I ever wanted to be.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, crazy."
Ann Perkins,"So, is this, like, your regular Tuesday night scene?"
Ann Perkins,I was.
Ann Perkins,"Me, too!"
Ann Perkins,Is this right?
Ann Perkins,Delicious waffles.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I told you I'm not going on a date with him."
Ann Perkins,Uhoh.
Ann Perkins,You're amazing!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, man, Tom told you."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,So
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's go home."
Ann Perkins,But you have to help me.
Ann Perkins,I think I may have made out with someone last night.
Ann Perkins,She's We're friends.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, friend."
Ann Perkins,Tom!
Ann Perkins,I know that look.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Right?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Leslie--"
Ann Perkins,Aw!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"And I have more power than Janine Restrepo, so I can do whatever I want."
Ann Perkins,I'm just former City Councilman Frank Whatever The Hell.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Let your kids play with medical tools all the time.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,Happy Valentine's Day.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,I bought him some actual towels.
Ann Perkins,He was using a bathrobe.
Ann Perkins,"And I bought him some other things that humans usually use, like shampoo."
Ann Perkins,Hot tip for you babysitters out there.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe it.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"My friend here is enrolling in the vet school next month, and she would like to be shown around."
Ann Perkins,You just kind of took off.
Ann Perkins,"I'm calling it ""Sparkle Skin"", by Annie."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you said that we were gonna hunt together."
Ann Perkins,That's loud.
Ann Perkins,I just learned that.
Ann Perkins,I put glitter in all your moisturizers and lotions.
Ann Perkins,I don't do that.
Ann Perkins,"Here, here!"
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna
Ann Perkins,Do you? Unh.
Ann Perkins,Do you want to grab some dinner?
Ann Perkins,"You, too."
Ann Perkins,Happy Birthday.
Ann Perkins,Thank God.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, it is an email from you."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and there's an attachment."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, man, I am way overdressed."
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, May 12th."
Ann Perkins,Are you sure?
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, you tried."
Ann Perkins,Do you want to get out of here?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,You kind of kissed me.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you're going through a lot."
Ann Perkins,I haven't seen you in forever!
Ann Perkins,"I'm really happy for you about your job and that you've learned some new words, but I'm sure about my decision."
Ann Perkins,"When you dumped me, it was really embarrassing."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I know."
Ann Perkins,"Twinkle, twinkle, big star."
Ann Perkins,Help me.
Ann Perkins,I'm good.
Ann Perkins,"Well, for that, you're gonna have to visit the bathroom first."
Ann Perkins,This is the most fun I have ever had with kids.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, maybe I should just go back to being a nurse full-time."
Ann Perkins,"Doctor Zoe, could you please use the reflex hammer to see if she's okay?"
Ann Perkins,I was.
Ann Perkins,"Doctors, the operation is now complete."
Ann Perkins,This is a fun conversation.
Ann Perkins,"So you go with Laura, who seems really nice and does not deserve to be tortured."
Ann Perkins,And I will come meet up with you after I finish at the baby store.
Ann Perkins,I am thinking about leaving.
Ann Perkins,We will.
Ann Perkins,"I came to see why Chris stood me up for lunch, but I think I just figured it out."
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm pretty sure that's not it."
Ann Perkins,I love you.
Ann Perkins,I'm hoping you know what that means.
Ann Perkins,You need to purge all this stuff that's been building up.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,I will try.
Ann Perkins,He's coming over.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, what are you gonna do?"
Ann Perkins,"Or, you could build a park with that money."
Ann Perkins,"Pro, we could fill in the pit and build a park."
Ann Perkins,That man is staring.
Ann Perkins,How was mountain climbing?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, I do very much want a drink."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, um, listen."
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, well, you ruined all of my clothes."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, that's funny."
Ann Perkins,You have to help me.
Ann Perkins,"Or they do hate me, and you're just desperate and tired."
Ann Perkins,This place is unbelievable.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's go."
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Ann Perkins,"Listen, let's do practice interview"
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna come in? You okay?
Ann Perkins,"Well, I eliminated everyone in a relationship and the obvious ""No"" s, like Knucklehair Dave from HR."
Ann Perkins,I mean... Sorry.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,I don't mind the knuckle hair.
Ann Perkins,I just think he's a dick.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, that's who I am."
Ann Perkins,And I was left with those three guys.
Ann Perkins,"Don't forget, they don't know about the sperm donor thing."
Ann Perkins,I don't want them to know.
Ann Perkins,I told them I was interviewing them for a blog.
Ann Perkins,Here comes the first one.
Ann Perkins,Dr. Harris!
Ann Perkins,I just keep having flashes of things that we said to each other.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, that was misleading."
Ann Perkins,Go.
Ann Perkins,For old time's sake.
Ann Perkins,We just had manicures together recently.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, there's no ring."
Ann Perkins,And check this out.
Ann Perkins,"We spend every day together, and we're having so much fun."
Ann Perkins,I hate jogging.
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Ann Perkins,Holy God.
Ann Perkins,Please?
Ann Perkins,"Jogging is the worst, Chris."
Ann Perkins,I was up all night brainstorming and this is the complete official list of candidates for Ann's baby daddy.
Ann Perkins,"It's really important, Perd."
Ann Perkins,"You know this is my house, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,We just had a drink.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we spent all day here for no reason."
Ann Perkins,You know what? You shouldn't wait around.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we're leaving, all right?"
Ann Perkins,You have any idea what they're going to cut?
Ann Perkins,"It was during that ""explore my freedom as a single woman"" phase."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, Leslie, you're totally right."
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna make a list of all the guys I already know who could be donors."
Ann Perkins,I love spending time with you.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,"And then, I'm gonna call them and tell them I'm doing some blog entry on men's health or something."
Ann Perkins,I can interview them and ask them whatever I want.
Ann Perkins,You're a genius!
Ann Perkins,"This is your idea, and I love it."
Ann Perkins,I'll call you later.
Ann Perkins,"No, they're not, they're terrible for you."
Ann Perkins,"What the hell is in Snake Juice, Demerol?"
Ann Perkins,So say goodbye to the nice man and thank me for saving you from being on Dateline.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, I just I got a fly."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I got it!
Ann Perkins,I feel like such a dick.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, come on."
Ann Perkins,I would take the shapes over this.
Ann Perkins,I went on a date with Perd.
Ann Perkins,Yep.
Ann Perkins,And she's so important to me.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I know it keeps you healthy, but God, at what cost?"
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, we'd love to hear about Bloomington."
Ann Perkins,It seems like a real hip kind of college town.
Ann Perkins,Good luck with Millicent.
Ann Perkins,Just back off a little bit.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, that's great."
Ann Perkins,Would you say you value education?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,What are you talking about?
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad we avoided that."
Ann Perkins,So what now?
Ann Perkins,You're not freaking out about this at all?
Ann Perkins,Just you do choose to spend the week with
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Never send a husband to do a best friend's job.
Ann Perkins,You turned yourself in? Why?
Ann Perkins,"Number two, the girls"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Well, Andy just wants you to be proud of him and his music."
Ann Perkins,"Out, Wyatt."
Ann Perkins,Walk it off.
Ann Perkins,"Number one, you've never been in a relationship that's lasted longer than a week."
Ann Perkins,#NAME?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, who does Sweetums want as their spokesperson?"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so why did you ask for the hearing?"
Ann Perkins,I don't work for you.
Ann Perkins,"Let me tell you why, because I'm in a crappy mood, and I don't really appreciate what's happening right here."
Ann Perkins,"Where is Mark, anyway?"
Ann Perkins,Unless you tell us how to get those sodas right now.
Ann Perkins,These were for a sick child at the hospital.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Donna just ripped off a stripper's underwear with her teeth."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"Uh, well, we're surrounded by hot guys."
Ann Perkins,Offense!
Ann Perkins,So are you still dunking basketballs?
Ann Perkins,Ow!
Ann Perkins,Things with me and Chris are going really well.
Ann Perkins,What a freak.
Ann Perkins,Please tell me.
Ann Perkins,"Ben, what is the first rule of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force?"
Ann Perkins,And some maturing.
Ann Perkins,What the hell happened?
Ann Perkins,Hello?
Ann Perkins,Good! That's... I'm happy for you.
Ann Perkins,How is that better than my park scene?
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Spin team!
Ann Perkins,See you.
Ann Perkins,Who just put 100 of these in their body?
Ann Perkins,"Is there, like, a better sperm bank in Eagleton or something?"
Ann Perkins,"No, not at all."
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,"You know, Andy and I broke up so long ago."
Ann Perkins,I don't think that I'd be the best source to Please.
Ann Perkins,What happened?
Ann Perkins,Don't say it.
Ann Perkins,Really.
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"Well, as a wise woman once said to me, ""Ann, you cunning, pliable, chestnut haired sunfish, phase 26 is the key to my plan."""
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,You're so relaxed.
Ann Perkins,"No offense, but maybe you think I'm going too fast 'cause you're going too slow with Ben."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, no offense, but maybe that's a little bit of an excuse for not acting on your feelings."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Pete, you look great."
Ann Perkins,"Being with you definitely made me do a lot of soul searching, and I came out the other side being a much more selfpossessed person."
Ann Perkins,Please have a seat.
Ann Perkins,So what's the next move?
Ann Perkins,"And at the end he said, ""I am going to kiss you now by putting my mouth on your mouth."""
Ann Perkins,And then I ran away.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Because I love him and I love you.
Ann Perkins,I'm sure she'll say yes.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, you know, nice guy Nice sperm."
Ann Perkins,"You can either burn these hats in a fire, or you can use a blowtorch."
Ann Perkins,"Just rent a limo, ask her to the prom."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,This guy went to Harvard!
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,"Well, for what it's worth, I'm really happy that you and Andy are married."
Ann Perkins,This guys seems healthy.
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,Dennis.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, Dennis."
Ann Perkins,So how long do you think you'll stay in Pawnee for?
Ann Perkins,Loves cycling.
Ann Perkins,Gorgeous.
Ann Perkins,"I think I'm gonna take off, too."
Ann Perkins,I really do.
Ann Perkins,This is so high school.
Ann Perkins,It has been a rough week.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"I think these are the only two films that say ""Sweetums"" on the label."
Ann Perkins,That is one thing I will not miss.
Ann Perkins,Iffy choice in men.
Ann Perkins,Pawnee raccoons.
Ann Perkins,Why wouldn't I be happy?
Ann Perkins,Probably.
Ann Perkins,Some sperm.
Ann Perkins,"""Yearning, by Dennis Feinstein."""
Ann Perkins,"It has everything I need: Video monitors, leadfree pacifiers."
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,These are the first bibs I've ever seen without Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s face on them.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,April?
Ann Perkins,"Excuse me, sorry."
Ann Perkins,"Dr. Saperstein is giving me a sonogram, in his doctor's office, for women, because I'm pregnant!"
Ann Perkins,"April, why aren't you at orientation?"
Ann Perkins,Always has been.
Ann Perkins,"No, it's Perkins."
Ann Perkins,"We are going back there right now, young lady."
Ann Perkins,Just check them out.
Ann Perkins,What the hell are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"So I'm ""Tommy's girl,"" and you're just ""Tom""?"
Ann Perkins,Imagine that.
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Ann Perkins,Rules are rules.
Ann Perkins,They have sensors!
Ann Perkins,Absolutely.
Ann Perkins,What are they doing out there?
Ann Perkins,You can't handle it.
Ann Perkins,"The shapes are awesome, is what they are."
Ann Perkins,"He did, huh?"
Ann Perkins,"Why not ""Ann's man""?"
Ann Perkins,How Ann gets it done.
Ann Perkins,And Ann.
Ann Perkins,Have you enjoyed your time with Andy?
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I would feel a little silly putting on a nice dress to go to ""the couch."""
Ann Perkins,What's that?
Ann Perkins,I couldn't-- I couldn't quite hear you.
Ann Perkins,I thought they hated me.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"Well, if it isn't Babe Lincoln!"
Ann Perkins,Just try to forget about it.
Ann Perkins,That's good!
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's a sugar rush."
Ann Perkins,A bar is four servings.
Ann Perkins,"I bought it for myself, but apparently, he was trying to win it for you, so I'm sorry."
Ann Perkins,Per serving.
Ann Perkins,"When I was a kid, I taught myself how to make out on this bear, pretended it was Cockroach from The Cosby Show."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"""High fructose corn syrup, corn syrup."""
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Andy."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but look at the ingredients."
Ann Perkins,"I was so into you, okay, and you basically turned me into a female version of yourself, and then you got bored dating me because you were dating yourself."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I can see why she likes you.
Ann Perkins,You're nice.
Ann Perkins,"No, no!"
Ann Perkins,What the hell?
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,"Huh I mean, I was jogging."
Ann Perkins,Shh!
Ann Perkins,Ann does not want a tattoo.
Ann Perkins,No one wants a tattoo.
Ann Perkins,Talking to Mark.
Ann Perkins,I don't I'm coming up there.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, in your humble opinion"
Ann Perkins,Smart woman.
Ann Perkins,You'd fire Jerry?
Ann Perkins,And see how you do.
Ann Perkins,You should come up with your own budget plan and just control your own destiny.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, there's nothing you can do to stop them tonight."
Ann Perkins,How about this one?
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I wonder who that is."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,That was very sweet.
Ann Perkins,That is easily the most exciting budget proposal I have ever heard.
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Harold."
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,Get it.
Ann Perkins,You wrote that?
Ann Perkins,"Let's get some almonds in you, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,"No, stop."
Ann Perkins,I call them like I see them.
Ann Perkins,Stop it.
Ann Perkins,I hope I'm not gonna have to explain to you that you don't actually own me.
Ann Perkins,Stop everything that you're doing.
Ann Perkins,The kids here are beefy.
Ann Perkins,But Pawnee is the fourth most obese city in America.
Ann Perkins,Stop it.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's what the judge said."
Ann Perkins,"Generally, I like to stay out of other people's business."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"If you say ""psych"" right now I'm gonna be really pissed."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God!"
Ann Perkins,"Hey, what's up?"
Ann Perkins,Yup.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,"They're gonna crash soon, and it's not gonna be pretty."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"They're just husky, big boned, plus-sized chunk monsters."
Ann Perkins,Kiss me more!
Ann Perkins,I'm so proud of you.
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, I don't know."
Ann Perkins,"Also, if you guys want to give me your credit cards, I'll just divide it up myself, I don't mind."
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,It seems like the kind of place a ska band would go to shoot heroin.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"It's just a fuse, People."
Ann Perkins,Just a fuse.
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I don't need to be here."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, can you approve this new design for the campaign poster?"
Ann Perkins,I'm hot.
Ann Perkins,Let me ask you something.
Ann Perkins,"So, you're leaving soon."
Ann Perkins,I know that.
Ann Perkins,He has two broken legs.
Ann Perkins,This is so sweet.
Ann Perkins,You just do everything your mom tells you to do?
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,You don't mean
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,What happened to you?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I just wanted to chat for a sec."
Ann Perkins,"You know, just so you could hear some things from me."
Ann Perkins,Verbal things from my mouth.
Ann Perkins,I think your mom's giving you bad advice.
Ann Perkins,Why are you taking the blame for this?
Ann Perkins,Did that sound weird?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's not gonna happen."
Ann Perkins,What month is it?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,We need to talk.
Ann Perkins,I think Tom is really nice.
Ann Perkins,"But then again, I'm not one to talk."
Ann Perkins,And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Ann Perkins,Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I snuck an Al Green song in there."
Ann Perkins,I want them to get together.
Ann Perkins,"Okay? Leslie covered for you, but I'm not gonna let her take any more crap from Ron on your sorry ass behalf."
Ann Perkins,I saw you shoot Ron.
Ann Perkins,Sue me.
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I don't think I can find a store that's open that sells slippers."
Ann Perkins,Mmm I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get those tonight.
Ann Perkins,I need to talk to you now.
Ann Perkins,That's great news.
Ann Perkins,Anything else?
Ann Perkins,Let me guess.
Ann Perkins,"Cool Ranch, got it."
Ann Perkins,You found room in other parts of the budget somewhere?
Ann Perkins,Now.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Tom, can I talk to you for a second?"
Ann Perkins,Awesome news.
Ann Perkins,"I'm leaving now, honey."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you know what else is pretty neat, is thanks to you, councilman Pillner went through the budget and decided that not just Public Works but all D1's will be terminated in two weeks."
Ann Perkins,I'm getting fired.
Ann Perkins,It wasn't you.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,I need another hour to get ready.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"You know, there was definitely some truth about that thing you said about me and Andy."
Ann Perkins,This is going to be fun.
Ann Perkins,Ew!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Just... Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I work at Saint Joe's.
Ann Perkins,Yippee!
Ann Perkins,Road trip!
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,He left with Tom.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I can't believe this.
Ann Perkins,"Here, baby."
Ann Perkins,Who's excited to go to Bloomington?
Ann Perkins,I'm driving.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Sit down.
Ann Perkins,Because it's lower in sodium?
Ann Perkins,Where else would I sit?
Ann Perkins,Yes?
Ann Perkins,"You know, Olive's kind of a cute name, if it's a girl."
Ann Perkins,"I helped April get into vet school in Bloomington and today's her orientation, so we're taking a little road trip."
Ann Perkins,"While I'm there, I'm also gonna pick up an organic baby blanket."
Ann Perkins,"I would get one in Pawnee, but fun fact our only baby store is attached to a chemical refinery."
Ann Perkins,"Every time Jerry looks at me, he's thinking about the milk in my boobs."
Ann Perkins,"It's just weird, you know? I mean, for so long, this little green olive was just our thing, and now it's everyone's thing."
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna put something on those scratches.
Ann Perkins,Our baby's not a salad.
Ann Perkins,I made a special road trip mix CD for us.
Ann Perkins,I hope you like Tori Amos.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know, it's justâ¦ I don't think it would beâ¦"
Ann Perkins,Any questions?
Ann Perkins,It is.
Ann Perkins,"Are we actually ever going to drink it, or we're just going to sniff it? I love sniffing."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I think Chris is cheating on me."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I do.
Ann Perkins,Take it.
Ann Perkins,I could help.
Ann Perkins,Just your eyes.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,It sounds like your mom's telling you to be slimy.
Ann Perkins,"That doesn't sound tough to me, that sounds slimy."
Ann Perkins,"No, not your whole head."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, follow my light."
Ann Perkins,So you're gonna blackmail her?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, everything's fine."
Ann Perkins,"First of all, this is Evelyn."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"I am, I promise."
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,She is my Health Department counterpart from Eagleton.
Ann Perkins,"When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie."
Ann Perkins,And both words are misspelled.
Ann Perkins,I know what happened.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,German?
Ann Perkins,How's it going out there?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,He's talking about you in his sleep.
Ann Perkins,He's pretty out of it.
Ann Perkins,We'll talk later.
Ann Perkins,"All right, later."
Ann Perkins,Give me something to do.
Ann Perkins,Don't get me wrong.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,I got to get back out there.
Ann Perkins,So I'm going out with Mark.
Ann Perkins,Leslie swears it's okay.
Ann Perkins,"So, dinner tonight, and here's the info."
Ann Perkins,Loved Andy.
Ann Perkins,I let them go into my nurse's bag.
Ann Perkins,You need to go talk to her.
Ann Perkins,"Diane, this is all my fault."
Ann Perkins,Loved him.
Ann Perkins,Got it.
Ann Perkins,I loved Andy.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually."
Ann Perkins,It was kind of weird.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I look really good in it.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, this is insane."
Ann Perkins,It's so obvious you're dying to be together.
Ann Perkins,And now you're going on a road trip?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you guys could literally ""get a room."""
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"All right, I will help you antiseduce him."
Ann Perkins,Just tell me what else you need.
Ann Perkins,She once made me eat an entire cheesecake at a potluck so she didn't look bad.
Ann Perkins,"Were there times that you were like, ""If I don't see Ann in, like, 10 seconds, I'm gonna die""?"
Ann Perkins,But I really think she's ready to listen.
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna get real?
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna be drinking anything.
Ann Perkins,Just wanted everybody to know that.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I'm not a big fan of group dinners where everybody splits the bill no matter what they get.
Ann Perkins,He was a totally helpless baby when we met.
Ann Perkins,I'll call you tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,We're gonna go.
Ann Perkins,I dated him for three years.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Ben."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Ann Perkins,"All right, girls, good hang."
Ann Perkins,That was the most sexual tension I have ever seen in a conversation about documents.
Ann Perkins,That's my cue.
Ann Perkins,"No, we're going home."
Ann Perkins,Nice to meet you.
Ann Perkins,I like you a lot.
Ann Perkins,That's bull [bleep].
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Ann Perkins,I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
Ann Perkins,And some other girl is going to reap the rewards of my hard work?
Ann Perkins,I left you three messages.
Ann Perkins,"I ordered a Tyranna-Caesar salad, and that's all I'm paying for."
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know she can be strong willed and difficult, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"I found the perfect guy to set you up with, but he's going out of town, so he can only do tonight, so I came over here right after work."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,See you.
Ann Perkins,"Now, he's an adult with a job."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, damn, now I have to go back."
Ann Perkins,"His name is Chris and he's an MRI technician, and he's really cute, and he's very passionate about his job, and I told him all about you, and he's really interested."
Ann Perkins,That's a dumb rule.
Ann Perkins,"Well, if you have to follow it, I would just suggest avoiding one-on-one, tensiony situations with him."
Ann Perkins,He's sitting right next to me.
Ann Perkins,My boyfriend Mark works here.
Ann Perkins,"Pleasure, actually."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,Did you get them?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, before you go on, can I just talk to you about something?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I have a good idea!"
Ann Perkins,"No, no, forget it."
Ann Perkins,"Also, P.S."
Ann Perkins,That's not-- No.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I think we're probably gonna take off, too."
Ann Perkins,That's not a good idea.
Ann Perkins,"it was delicious and amazing, like everything she does."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, I don'tâ¦"
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,Will you please just talk to her?
Ann Perkins,"We're gonna go dark, people."
Ann Perkins,For my sake?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"No, I really don't."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Bachelorette party.
Ann Perkins,"I don't have unlimited texting, and when she can't talk to you, she texts me."
Ann Perkins,Come on in.
Ann Perkins,"Bear with us, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey, by the way, I don't think I can get that book back from what's his name."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, how is everyone?"
Ann Perkins,When we were together.
Ann Perkins,When we were together-- I can't see you.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,We gotta switch off the main fuse hose.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Pants King!
Ann Perkins,That's a good thing.
Ann Perkins,I'm not doing that.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"""Girl""?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, are you serious?"
Ann Perkins,Never heard of it.
Ann Perkins,"Because with everything she's done for me, I would eat ten cheesecakes for her."
Ann Perkins,Whoo.
Ann Perkins,Let's go.
Ann Perkins,We met at the supermarket.
Ann Perkins,I don't have any actual proof.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Sometimes your relentless cheeriness is confusing.
Ann Perkins,"Well, we had a really good conversation about our relationship last week, and he was very reassuring that we're headed in a good direction."
Ann Perkins,Like that time we went to Eagleton and we got that hotel room with the jacuzzi
Ann Perkins,But then he got distant.
Ann Perkins,"And when I asked to come visit him in Indianapolis, he was totally weird."
Ann Perkins,He was weird.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,But what if I'm not?
Ann Perkins,Yikes.
Ann Perkins,What if I'm not?
Ann Perkins,Why don't you ask him about his penis?
Ann Perkins,What if he has a girl up there?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Andy, please."
Ann Perkins,This is this is traumatic for me.
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you do this every week.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,I had that exact doll when I was a kid.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go do it right now.
Ann Perkins,I think he's cheating on me.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"Jimmy Carter's ""Crisis of Confidence"" speech, Learning to Speak Mandarin, 16 minutes of Old Timey Car Horn, and something called Banjo Boogie Bonanza."
Ann Perkins,That worked?
Ann Perkins,"But I will find you someone, I promise, and he'll be awesome."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,Perkins does it again.
Ann Perkins,I will just tell him what you look like.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Evelyn, I'll see you back in my office."
Ann Perkins,As much as any one dress could.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, this is all pretty overwhelming, you know?"
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,I will.
Ann Perkins,It's been a tough morning.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,This is the city planner.
Ann Perkins,You made me watch all eight Harry Potter movies.
Ann Perkins,"Justin, this is Mark."
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,"You are a massive, enormous, runaway steamroller with no brakes and a cement brick on the gas pedal."
Ann Perkins,What's the story?
Ann Perkins,"Wait, is that two different subs?"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, meatball and ham."
Ann Perkins,I'll get one for you on the way home.
Ann Perkins,We made it work.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I can't leave now."
Ann Perkins,You're a steamroller!
Ann Perkins,It's the most romantic story ever.
Ann Perkins,"No, what I was gonna say is that you really are"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm just telling you this"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,Actually
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not-- I'm not mad at you."
Ann Perkins,Sorry!
Ann Perkins,"All right, so you have everything you need for orientation?"
Ann Perkins,Get it yourself.
Ann Perkins,Who are?
Ann Perkins,It makes The Notebook look like Saw V.
Ann Perkins,Are you having trouble breathing?
Ann Perkins,How about that?
Ann Perkins,You look like you're trying to look laidback.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna call Dr. Harris right now.
Ann Perkins,It's not true? So you're calling Dr. Harris a liar?
Ann Perkins,"He's dumb, but he's fun."
Ann Perkins,That's for a hangover.
Ann Perkins,Let's do this!
Ann Perkins,We're not going anywhere.
Ann Perkins,Why is he being such an ass?
Ann Perkins,I don't know if they can do that.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so what happened?"
Ann Perkins,"Also, I can talk about my qualifications for this position."
Ann Perkins,Marley and Me!
Ann Perkins,"Man, I thought this would be more satisfying."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, that's the whole point of dating around is you get to try on a bunch of different hats."
Ann Perkins,Is it your heart?
Ann Perkins,Are you okay?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, look at that."
Ann Perkins,You're not scared to eat here?
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"This candidate could, especially because this candidate also behaved like a total jackass."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, are you mad that I came here?"
Ann Perkins,"Puppies, puppies, puppies!"
Ann Perkins,It's waffles!
Ann Perkins,That should be the official slogan for Snake Juice.
Ann Perkins,I think just maybe just stand how you would normally stand.
Ann Perkins,You didn't do anything wrong?
Ann Perkins,Lots of regret and shame.
Ann Perkins,I waited on you hand and foot.
Ann Perkins,"And it was exhausting! I fed you meals, and you could've had your casts off two weeks ago!"
Ann Perkins,I don't even like Harry Potter.
Ann Perkins,"Chris and I have been talking, and we are thinking very seriously about leaving Pawnee and moving somewhere else to start our family"
Ann Perkins,"But first, I am gonna go throw up in a wastebasket."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Are you okay?
Ann Perkins,I would like to actually learn something.
Ann Perkins,I'm a homeowner.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he was breaking into this van and they dragged him away."
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,It was crazy.
Ann Perkins,"Zoe, stop it, please!"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I had some encouragement."
Ann Perkins,I can understand why people like that.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Am I the only [bleep] Person here who doesn't know Janine Restrepo?
Ann Perkins,He's a man.
Ann Perkins,I have a boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, hey, Leslie, how about instead of slightly changing a lot of banners, we paint our toenails to look like pumpkins?"
Ann Perkins,You're lucky.
Ann Perkins,"And if I had known, I would not have agreed to it."
Ann Perkins,You're always so busy.
Ann Perkins,"Somebody in here's gotta have keys, right?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Just friends.
Ann Perkins,That's dangerous!
Ann Perkins,"Ron, no, no, no, no!"
Ann Perkins,I haven't heard anything.
Ann Perkins,Girls!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, please stop looking at him."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,That was so professional.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, that was intense."
Ann Perkins,She totally surprised me.
Ann Perkins,"You know, the girls with the tribal back tattoos who drink Red Bull for a living."
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Ann Perkins,Is that Donna?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I'm not mad at all.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Ohh.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie, be professional."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"You guys, can you just put him on the day bed in the carcass room?"
Ann Perkins,I'm Leslie's trophy wife.
Ann Perkins,That sounds terrible.
Ann Perkins,This is my evening.
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,We're not gonna think about that right now.
Ann Perkins,I guess that's it.
Ann Perkins,Get out.
Ann Perkins,I'm so happy you said that.
Ann Perkins,"I just need you to stay calm, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"Ron, it's actually not that serious."
Ann Perkins,"Wow, that's disgusting."
Ann Perkins,"You've heard this story before, right?"
Ann Perkins,Get out of my house.
Ann Perkins,"Take a walk with your overly-healed legs, and let me think about this relationship."
Ann Perkins,"They put a big sombrero on you, and then everybody sings ""Happy Birthday""?"
Ann Perkins,Over here.
Ann Perkins,April?
Ann Perkins,And backwards.
Ann Perkins,"She kidnapped me from work, and then she took me to that place, Senor Vega's, you know, where the mariachi band comes out."
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Tom."
Ann Perkins,We're so much better than that.
Ann Perkins,"Look, that guy's trying to break into that van."
Ann Perkins,How are you feeling?
Ann Perkins,Is she okay?
Ann Perkins,You just push too hard sometimes.
Ann Perkins,"No, you're very passionate."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you do what you want, you ignore what other people want, and you hear only what you want to hear."
Ann Perkins,Interesting.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, well, the flange was a little warped."
Ann Perkins,I just think we need to talk about what that means for us.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you told me to wake you up at 1:45."
Ann Perkins,"Well, it's my headache!"
Ann Perkins,That crowd.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,What is your ideal man?
Ann Perkins,"Good for you, man."
Ann Perkins,I don't want to be clingy.
Ann Perkins,I wasn't competing for that.
Ann Perkins,That's great!
Ann Perkins,I really do.
Ann Perkins,Ron loves Mommy!
Ann Perkins,So I just goosed it with a triple three bolt smack.
Ann Perkins,"I, uh, I'm gonna step down, and I'm gonna turn my job over to Evelyn."
Ann Perkins,Ron loves Mommy!
Ann Perkins,Was I a good girlfriend?
Ann Perkins,"When you do it, you really do it."
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did! That is so cute!"
Ann Perkins,What? Did you just say you love Diane?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Nobody got hurt.
Ann Perkins,"It's a ""yes"" or ""no"" question."
Ann Perkins,"That's a, high weird bar."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, let's go."
Ann Perkins,"It's hard, I can'tâ¦ I can't putâ¦"
Ann Perkins,Hi!
Ann Perkins,Ron! Bed! Now!
Ann Perkins,"We had a good relationship, right?"
Ann Perkins,"And any way you slice it, they're just extremely unhealthy for you."
Ann Perkins,That would be good.
Ann Perkins,What NutriYums energy bars are just absolutely loaded with high fructose corn syrup and fatty oils.
Ann Perkins,I just need to talk some more words into Leslie's face.
Ann Perkins,"You know, you have a friend who has a tattoo that says, ""Daddy's Girl."""
Ann Perkins,"We were just on the computer, looking at your profile."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you were."
Ann Perkins,I just... I don't... I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, he's really, really, really great, and you're so great, obviously."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I don't, I just don't know if that would be the right fit."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,And the jacuzzi broke.
Ann Perkins,We are going to lunch tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,"You would like that, wouldn't you?"
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,Andy! God!
Ann Perkins,It's 1:45 now.
Ann Perkins,Did you know they made those for adults?
Ann Perkins,The roller?
Ann Perkins,"No, that's bad."
Ann Perkins,Forever. He practically saved my life.
Ann Perkins,It's gonna be okay.
Ann Perkins,"I left her, like, and her outgoing message is just her sobbing and burping and crazy laughing."
Ann Perkins,"Just off the bat, there's a couple of doctors I think you would love."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"He was like, the only cool dude at my high school."
Ann Perkins,Aw!
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,It's not that bad.
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Ann Perkins,Andy Dwyer!
Ann Perkins,"You're gonna need to purge, right now!"
Ann Perkins,"But if he asked me to move with him, I think I would."
Ann Perkins,"He's moving back to Indianapolis in a couple of weeks, which sucks."
Ann Perkins,It's him.
Ann Perkins,And it's not just because of the supplements he has me taking and the soluble fiber and the increase in regularity.
Ann Perkins,You have two perfectly good legs.
Ann Perkins,"And then we went back to my house, and she invited basically everyone I knew, and she had this great guy doing face painting, and I had my face painted like a fairy tiger."
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, I haven't felt this good in years."
Ann Perkins,"No, Ron, you cannot drink Scotch with this."
Ann Perkins,"He's just, like, a really amazing person."
Ann Perkins,"So, that was fun."
Ann Perkins,How many did you take?
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Ann Perkins,Donna uses it for menstrual cramps.
Ann Perkins,"Well, the pain medication I gave you is pretty strong."
Ann Perkins,Surprisingly fun.
Ann Perkins,Not a chance.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay."
Ann Perkins,Are you lightheaded?
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, welcome home!"
Ann Perkins,Will you come in for a nightcap?
Ann Perkins,"Please, you guys are the only people here I know."
Ann Perkins,"And your reaction, from someone we love so much, I mean, it just makes up for all the other ones."
Ann Perkins,Are you dizzy?
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,I would like a glass of white wine.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,I would like it to be chardonnay.
Ann Perkins,And I would like that with one ice cube.
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna take this bag, too."
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Ron."
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,He's actually a pretty smart rodent.
Ann Perkins,His shoulders!
Ann Perkins,"No, let's not."
Ann Perkins,Let me ask you a question.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, get, grab his mustache!"
Ann Perkins,We never did.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Boy.
Ann Perkins,It's a block of sugar.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I would love to come hit on chicks with you guys, but she seems kind of engaged in something and I think I should probably stay."
Ann Perkins,Ron?
Ann Perkins,"I know, but it's so fun to talk like that."
Ann Perkins,"Ron, you have to."
Ann Perkins,Sugar.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you girls clean up all this hair, and I'm gonna talk to Ron."
Ann Perkins,And then there was a bouncy castle.
Ann Perkins,"Also, she did it, like, a week before my birthday, which is genius, 'cause I had no idea it was coming."
Ann Perkins,Open his mouth.
Ann Perkins,What are you saying exactly?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What are you eating?
Ann Perkins,Open his mouth.
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,We're staying with you.
Ann Perkins,Can you open his mouth?
Ann Perkins,It's so awesome to see you.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"When we go out to a bar, you order my drinks for me."
Ann Perkins,"Well, at least it's not a fat human hamster eating meat."
Ann Perkins,Morning.
Ann Perkins,So high school.
Ann Perkins,That's all the men that I know.
Ann Perkins,Run or I punch you.
Ann Perkins,"You want her to remember you? Go spend time with her and do something memorable, dummy!"
Ann Perkins,"The point is, she's leaving in two days."
Ann Perkins,"You know, I'm mostly fine being single."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,You mean guys like you
Ann Perkins,"So, just like that, boom huge life decision made?"
Ann Perkins,"Absolutely not, but if we break up or you die tragically in a city planning accident and I wait a respectful amount of time, I don't know. Maybeâ¦"
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Ann Perkins,"Kiss one water fountain drinker, you're kissing everyone in Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,"Actually, how do you even get girls like her-- or me-- to go out with you?"
Ann Perkins,"Seriously, I really hope you guys are all very happy Damn it."
Ann Perkins,I will go out with you.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Double shift, remember?"
Ann Perkins,"It's like this weird, disgusting, local quirk."
Ann Perkins,To the end of Tan.
Ann Perkins,I would like to announce that the name Tan is officially over.
Ann Perkins,Should someone stop Jerry?
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,How do you get your gut to talk to you?
Ann Perkins,"Tom, bear or no bear, she clearly likes you."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Neither of you want Jamm to win, nor do I, because I hate Paunch Burger, but, if there is one in my backyard, I will eat there, like, every night, and that is no good."
Ann Perkins,"So I say we stop playing dirty with each other, and we start playing dirty with Jamm."
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,Did you?
Ann Perkins,"Well, that's it."
Ann Perkins,"I hope so, because the only way that this gala is going to happen is if you do everything I say."
Ann Perkins,There was only one other woman at that cabin.
Ann Perkins,"It's not me, it's not Donna, it's not Leslie."
Ann Perkins,"Well, Macklin, it's not MonaLisa."
Ann Perkins,"What the hell are you doing? ""Andy and Ann's Family Shoeshine""?"
Ann Perkins,The thing I'm having is a gut feeling.
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know you don't believe this, but I care about your future."
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just tell Ben she's your mother?
Ann Perkins,And I'm just a little disappointed that you're just not following through with this.
Ann Perkins,It's really hard to end a relationship because of distance.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm sorry, but I don't think you thought this through."
Ann Perkins,I feel sorry for Leslie.
Ann Perkins,Just get back on that horse.
Ann Perkins,It's really hard to say congrats without sounding sarcastic.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Ron, did we make out last night?"
Ann Perkins,"What if Marlene says, ""Hey, have you met my daughter, Leslie?"""
Ann Perkins,"""She works in the Parks Department."""
Ann Perkins,"Dude, I'm, like, three months pregnant."
Ann Perkins,"You don't have someone in your life that you think, ""I don't know, maybe if things were different, maybe, some day..."""
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,You just told us to applaud.
Ann Perkins,"Well, if I told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?"
Ann Perkins,"No, no. Justin."
Ann Perkins,I'm here.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm I'm I'm in a bit of a lull right now, but I'm so glad that you all have people in your lives that you care about, so Congrats!"
Ann Perkins,What if he sees a picture of her on your desk?
Ann Perkins,"It's just this time of year with the hearts and roses, it just gets me a little down."
Ann Perkins,"But galentine's day made me feel better, so thanks."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,We'll talk later.
Ann Perkins,And I just didn't feel that.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, he's emotional."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, great."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie and Ben have enough to deal with, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"Go in there, calm him down, make him feel better."
Ann Perkins,"Chris is in the back room, and he's crying."
Ann Perkins,You're supposed to miss the other person even if they're only gone for 20 minutes.
Ann Perkins,Let her be herself.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"Because he's in therapy right now, and it's dredging up a lot of stuff for him."
Ann Perkins,"I'm not gonna tell, that that bitch over there, I don't need to brag"
Ann Perkins,April.
Ann Perkins,This is the first time you've said my entire name correctly.
Ann Perkins,You're supposed to fight sometimes.
Ann Perkins,"Guys, I need your help, okay?"
Ann Perkins,You got it.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well I will make sure that everything else runs smoothly."
Ann Perkins,Everything okay?
Ann Perkins,That's not a good sign.
Ann Perkins,So I won't see you till tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,"But maybe you thought it was so amazing, because you've never dated someone for so long before."
Ann Perkins,"Okeydokey, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,"Mark, honestly, it was really nice."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Well, right now my gut is saying that we are going to listen to Mariah Carey the whole way home."
Ann Perkins,That's great.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, who was supposed to deal with Transit?"
Ann Perkins,Did you say something?
Ann Perkins,"How could any sane person call that ""small""?"
Ann Perkins,I'm scared.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, do you mean the ""li'I swallow""?"
Ann Perkins,Is that a promise?
Ann Perkins,Does anybody buy that?
Ann Perkins,"I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and it's government owned and you need to do something about it."
Ann Perkins,I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Just go, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I'mI'm trying to figure out how to make me happy.
Ann Perkins,"Because I'm dating myself right now, okay?"
Ann Perkins,See you out there.
Ann Perkins,"Like, I don't know, his friends are getting married, and he's not dating anyone."
Ann Perkins,"For some reason, when people in Pawnee use the water fountain, they put their mouths completely over the spouts."
Ann Perkins,"Uh, correction."
Ann Perkins,"That's ""Mission ImPawneeable: Knope Protocol."""
Ann Perkins,Come here.
Ann Perkins,"There's no reason not to love him, but I didn't."
Ann Perkins,Highway to the Danger Zone.
Ann Perkins,And now everything's great.
Ann Perkins,"And I apologized, and he apologized."
Ann Perkins,"You know, I just--"
Ann Perkins,Boo.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, when we were carrying you to bed, you correctly pointed out that we were arguing about stuff that was stupid, and so we talked it out."
Ann Perkins,You have my phone number?
Ann Perkins,Terrific.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait, do you never just take a second to enjoy things?"
Ann Perkins,What would you think about raising our child somewhere other than Pawnee?
Ann Perkins,"Although, that's pretty much why I broke up with Andy."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Stephen."
Ann Perkins,"Trust me, I tried."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah, you do not wanna go down that road."
Ann Perkins,Have you seen
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Ron."
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna miss you.
Ann Perkins,I'm 100% sure that I will not meet another Donna Meagle in Michigan.
Ann Perkins,I don't really see them together.
Ann Perkins,I heard you on the radio.
Ann Perkins,"He passed out over his arm, and slumped onto the floor."
Ann Perkins,Thanks for doing that.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,Buckets of blood.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,You know?
Ann Perkins,"Plus, Leslie just got out of a relationship, so I didn't want Justin to be, like, her rebound guy or anything, you know?"
Ann Perkins,What is this urgent meeting with Donna and Jerry?
Ann Perkins,Serrated?
Ann Perkins,"Uh, three and a half inch?"
Ann Perkins,I thought building a park on Lot 48 was going to be our legacy.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,You guys sound good.
Ann Perkins,It is possible that you were right.
Ann Perkins,Happily.
Ann Perkins,"This is obviously a huge decision, and I should take my time."
Ann Perkins,My sarcastic advice.
Ann Perkins,A lot of love in this room.
Ann Perkins,How'd it go?
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,I don't think it's going that well.
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Wow, we really picked some intense people to spend our lives with, huh?"
Ann Perkins,I'm just gonna put that over there.
Ann Perkins,"Awesome, thank you."
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,Leslie can't watch anything with Julie Andrews in it before bedtime because it gets her too hyper.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is so nice!"
Ann Perkins,NutriYum bars?
Ann Perkins,Ugh!
Ann Perkins,"Crazy, right?"
Ann Perkins,So did we!
Ann Perkins,"And now that she's had a little time to recharge, she is like a toddler bouncing back from a nap."
Ann Perkins,"Boom! I win! And so when I finally cleaned up the vomit, I found the toe."
Ann Perkins,Everyone in the universe loves a gross medical story.
Ann Perkins,"As a nurse and as your friend, I highly suggest you don't try to stay up for the next 24 hours."
Ann Perkins,Number two is right.
Ann Perkins,The bone showed.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,In the fire.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,This guy I know from the hospital.
Ann Perkins,April.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,This is amazing.
Ann Perkins,I need some more vitamin D.
Ann Perkins,Justin is over there talking to Mark.
Ann Perkins,"It's called ""Womb There It Is."""
Ann Perkins,How many of you are in here?
Ann Perkins,I have an office mate?
Ann Perkins,Is Leslie here?
Ann Perkins,Morning.
Ann Perkins,"My God, this is amazing."
Ann Perkins,Already.
Ann Perkins,Are you guysâ¦
Ann Perkins,There was not.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, look, the pit already has six friends."
Ann Perkins,Never mind.
Ann Perkins,Bikini one.
Ann Perkins,I don't.
Ann Perkins,"Fine, fine, fine!"
Ann Perkins,I can't believe that Leslie and I got drunk in a bar and fought about boys.
Ann Perkins,"Aw, man."
Ann Perkins,Give me the bikini one.
Ann Perkins,Can we please talk about what happened back there?
Ann Perkins,Now.
Ann Perkins,All of it.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,Take those pictures down.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,There was definitely times when we thought maybe we would go out someday.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not."
Ann Perkins,He lived way too close to me.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, fine."
Ann Perkins,"Look, Mark has been really cool about all this, and you're throwing it in his face."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Please don't say it.
Ann Perkins,I am so tired.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,"Hi, I'm Ann."
Ann Perkins,"Is that a drawing of my reproductive system saying ""Let's do this""?"
Ann Perkins,Genuine praise.
Ann Perkins,What about 50 bucks?
Ann Perkins,"Well, what do you expect, you know."
Ann Perkins,They're like a million years old.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, let's just assume that I'm an adult who doesn't have two weeks to play arcade games."
Ann Perkins,Why are we talking about this?
Ann Perkins,"Well, this guy came in."
Ann Perkins,It's one of the grossest things I've ever seen.
Ann Perkins,And loose onions.
Ann Perkins,I probably shouldn't talk about it.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm ready."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we are."
Ann Perkins,This is just a bunch of bras and knives.
Ann Perkins,And I had this really weird patient.
Ann Perkins,You should phrase that differently.
Ann Perkins,How much does this bear cost?
Ann Perkins,My God!
Ann Perkins,I cannot believe it!
Ann Perkins,Excuse me.
Ann Perkins,"Knope, you have outknoped yourself."
Ann Perkins,I had this exact bear when I was a kid!
Ann Perkins,I took a half shift at the hospital last night.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,"No, don't say it."
Ann Perkins,Why is there a New Year's Eve countdown clock and the Easter bunny?
Ann Perkins,"He got his hand stuck in a Pringles can, and he tried to cut himself out."
Ann Perkins,Where's Leslie?
Ann Perkins,Are you gonna be okay?
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry I was such a freak.
Ann Perkins,"I would yell some more, but I think I just peed my pants a little bit."
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Ann Perkins,It's not awesome.
Ann Perkins,You talked to Chris before you talked to me?
Ann Perkins,"And for you madam, the Leslie Knope."
Ann Perkins,Someone we know is pregnant?
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,These are blank.
Ann Perkins,What is the one thing that you bring with you?
Ann Perkins,You're stranded on a desert island.
Ann Perkins,That's the nicest gift anybody's ever gotten me in my life!
Ann Perkins,I'm trying to get pregnant.
Ann Perkins,And you know what?
Ann Perkins,But you know what?
Ann Perkins,"I thought you guys would be cool with me complaining 'cause it's all you do, is sit here and complain without judgment or guilt."
Ann Perkins,"I have a million things I need to complain about, and I can't take them home because Chris is the most considerate person in the world, and he just wants to help me, and then I feel bad about that, and then I get annoyed that he wants to help me, and I feel even worse about that!"
Ann Perkins,You know what my biggest complaint is?
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,To Knope 2012.
Ann Perkins,Ohh!
Ann Perkins,That's almost exactly the opposite of what I meant.
Ann Perkins,I see how it is.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Uhoh.
Ann Perkins,I guess I was wrong.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,That's not fair.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, great, and happy for them, and congratulations, whatever, but ooh!"
Ann Perkins,"Surprisingly, no, Larry Bird has not RSVP'd yet."
Ann Perkins,Did I ever get it?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Ann Perkins,I'll do it when I get home.
Ann Perkins,Gossip Town?
Ann Perkins,"If you destroy him early, please come by."
Ann Perkins,Dude! You remembered me complaining about my computer bag!
Ann Perkins,"I can not believe the cafeteria named a sandwich after you, that is so cool."
Ann Perkins,That is amazing.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"As Leslie's maid of honor, I really need her bachelorette party to go well."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,That sounds fun.
Ann Perkins,It's way better than the gift that I got you.
Ann Perkins,You can have as many burgers as you want.
Ann Perkins,I will buy lunch.
Ann Perkins,It's Pacers tickets.
Ann Perkins,We have to find out who this is.
Ann Perkins,Boo!
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,They're not even good seats!
Ann Perkins,"I love you, and everything's gonna be okay."
Ann Perkins,It's Ann.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's perfect."
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Ann Perkins,Ron--
Ann Perkins,"Well, we got most of the artifacts, and even if we didn't, they probably won't find them."
Ann Perkins,"When we dated, he made me do it every week."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"After the first day, we realized we had made a huge mistake."
Ann Perkins,Mm.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Hmm.
Ann Perkins,And Nine seconds with Ron.
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna borrow my yoga pants?
Ann Perkins,"It's crazy boring, it lasts forever, you're gonna wish you were dead."
Ann Perkins,"No takebacks, partner."
Ann Perkins,Who's your favorite character on Sex and the City?
Ann Perkins,Totally.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,How's your sister doin'?
Ann Perkins,"All right, so Tom, here's your chicken caesar salad, no dressing, no cheese, no croutons, no taste."
Ann Perkins,where'd you get it?
Ann Perkins,I really like your haircut.
Ann Perkins,"I was looking to get some new music, and I was wondering if you could recommend anything."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April."
Ann Perkins,I'm up to four seconds with April.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I've made a little progress."
Ann Perkins,Shocking that our drunken plan to move in together wasn't a success.
Ann Perkins,I don't--
Ann Perkins,That's cool.
Ann Perkins,"Bye, thank you."
Ann Perkins,And it didn't.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, here's the deal."
Ann Perkins,That's a great photo op.
Ann Perkins,"However, everyone was being so smug about it, saying there's no way it would last, so we're pretending to still be together."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just give the kids water?
Ann Perkins,Coffee?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, do you need a lawyer?"
Ann Perkins,Food.
Ann Perkins,I'm not pregnant.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,You know I can't be around smoke or fatty tuna.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey, Donna, what the hell?"
Ann Perkins,Is that a question?
Ann Perkins,Because my friend Justin's a lawyer.
Ann Perkins,I'm sure he could help.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Ann Perkins,"Ugh, and Lamaze class, wait till I tell you about that Ponzi scheme."
Ann Perkins,Food.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,He should just get that.
Ann Perkins,"That way, no one gets the satisfaction of being right, even though they are, but still."
Ann Perkins,I'll call him.
Ann Perkins,It's so beautiful and sparkly.
Ann Perkins,Justin's the greatest guy ever.
Ann Perkins,You just need to blow off some steam.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, sic the police on a bunch of kids and puppies."
Ann Perkins,"What do you want, Macklin?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, they should change their name to Big, Lying Baby."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, for God's sakes."
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,"No, I can drink it."
Ann Perkins,At least he finally has a real job.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,"Not a lot of customers, huh?"
Ann Perkins,There's
Ann Perkins,"No, there's more tissue."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,"You all right, man?"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Sorry to interrupt.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you guys, come on in."
Ann Perkins,"Honey, can you just clean up a little bit?"
Ann Perkins,It's not fair.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we need to talk."
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, I brought this cholesterol testing kit for the health thing."
Ann Perkins,Why are you guys talking to each other? You know what? Forget it.
Ann Perkins,Leslie
Ann Perkins,Or Don't Forget To Bring Home Beers After Work.
Ann Perkins,I'm not getting into this with you.
Ann Perkins,No! I didn't do anything wrong.
Ann Perkins,Leslie
Ann Perkins,That's terrible.
Ann Perkins,Everything'll be fine.
Ann Perkins,"No, that's not a good idea."
Ann Perkins,This morning you put glitter in the butter.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Leslie told me you were working here now."
Ann Perkins,"When we were dating, the only job he had was sending audition tapes to Survivor and Deal or No Deal."
Ann Perkins,Don't take it out on everybody else.
Ann Perkins,You're mad at me.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, don't apologize."
Ann Perkins,"I'm telling you, this is the best way to get over someone."
Ann Perkins,- I'm having one right now.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,It does.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Partner.
Ann Perkins,"There's just been, like, a long, slow fart stream coming out of me since we started talking this morning."
Ann Perkins,And I'm so gassy.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,Get off me.
Ann Perkins,A new surprise every day.
Ann Perkins,We're really good.
Ann Perkins,We're good.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Oh shh, stop it"
Ann Perkins,"It's like I have a tension headache, but in my calves."
Ann Perkins,Now my legs really hurt.
Ann Perkins,"April, wake up."
Ann Perkins,It was okay.
Ann Perkins,"God, that guy is the worst!"
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"Look, we are stuck in this room until the drill is over."
Ann Perkins,What are we gonna do?
Ann Perkins,"Enough for 2,000 people."
Ann Perkins,You got it.
Ann Perkins,Will you stop putting glitter in everything?
Ann Perkins,"You're the nicest, most thoughtful baby daddy a girl could ask for."
Ann Perkins,Or Where's My Sandwich?
Ann Perkins,"It says right there, you're dead, so is everyone you care about."
Ann Perkins,I'm not the one who's being a stupid jerk right now.
Ann Perkins,I'm not the stupid jerk.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I hate them."
Ann Perkins,I have an idea. Why don't you let me set you up?
Ann Perkins,But I'm not about to say that in there.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I actually think a library would be nice that close to my house.
Ann Perkins,"Aw, that's a sweet picture."
Ann Perkins,Why do we hate the library?
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,I thought you should see why Leslie tanked the drill.
Ann Perkins,"Councilman Jamm used you as a stalling tactic, hoping it would kill Leslie's park project."
Ann Perkins,"It's kind of weird when she just starts raining compliments on you, huh?"
Ann Perkins,"If the test were any other day, Leslie would have aced it."
Ann Perkins,Have you ever thought of being a sperm donor?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I don't need to know that."
Ann Perkins,Message.
Ann Perkins,It's not all my fault.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week, which is really impressive."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, until now, my only experience with government was trying to get a recycling bin."
Ann Perkins,Good!
Ann Perkins,So how are you feeling about the whole Dave situation?
Ann Perkins,Which is why I'm stress eating gummy penises.
Ann Perkins,"Lesie, Ken Hotate is right over there, you need to talk to him before the meeting and come clean."
Ann Perkins,Why did you open that basket? It doesn't really seem like you.
Ann Perkins,I don't understand how this is my fault.
Ann Perkins,I appreciate it.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, I will."
Ann Perkins,Can't win.
Ann Perkins,Are you sure it's not you?
Ann Perkins,Come here.
Ann Perkins,This is none of your business.
Ann Perkins,You don't know what you're talking about.
Ann Perkins,Maybe we shouldn't.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Didn't you just explain why?
Ann Perkins,That sounds really good.
Ann Perkins,"But your swagger and your showmanship and your confidence is part of you, and in small doses, it can help."
Ann Perkins,Stop.
Ann Perkins,"Enough with your favors, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, I didn't know that."
Ann Perkins,"Ben, don't you dare hurt her."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you deserve the best, and you found it."
Ann Perkins,I'm having one.
Ann Perkins,"And when that's the case, it's hard not to be cynical about love and relationships, but it's couples like you that give hope to the rest of us."
Ann Perkins,My romantic life has been a bit of a mixed bag lately.
Ann Perkins,I'm an eggplant.
Ann Perkins,"Everyone, before everyone else gets here, I'd like to make a little toast."
Ann Perkins,"They had a bike-sharing program and a vegan Afghan restaurant and-- Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Murder She Wrote.
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna choose.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,"They had all the baby supplies we need, and they had all this other cool stuff."
Ann Perkins,I'm dating Mark!
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Ann Perkins,It was amazing.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, everything's settled here."
Ann Perkins,Did you put glitter in the laundry detergent?
Ann Perkins,"Bye everybody, bye."
Ann Perkins,for instance?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did."
Ann Perkins,"You said ""murinal."""
Ann Perkins,I heard it.
Ann Perkins,You're gonna love it here.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, keep going, keep going."
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go dance.
Ann Perkins,San Diego.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not offended at all. I don't know him that well."
Ann Perkins,Bloomington is great.
Ann Perkins,Do you have any plates or anything?
Ann Perkins,Geez.
Ann Perkins,You could learn how to surf.
Ann Perkins,"Well, he seemed great."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Les."
Ann Perkins,Maybe I should just give them all free flu shots.
Ann Perkins,You're smart.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"I'll find you somebody else, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"April, don't flake out on this."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm game."
Ann Perkins,Please?
Ann Perkins,Are you gonna go?
Ann Perkins,Who wants homemade peanut brittle?
Ann Perkins,"Just stop singing, please."
Ann Perkins,Why do you look so bummed out?
Ann Perkins,There is a pilgrim line dancing with a box of candies.
Ann Perkins,"Dude, you wore me down."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is the most incredible event that has ever been thrown."
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know that you and Leslie have had your disagreements in the past, but we really need the key, and we can only get the key if we get the sodas."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I came from the hospital."
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,You guys look like you're having fun.
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,How's the date going?
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Having fun?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Ann Perkins,Just don't let this sour you on dating.
Ann Perkins,That's so sweet.
Ann Perkins,That's rude.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, Ron."
Ann Perkins,Where'd that come from?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,Please.
Ann Perkins,Mark is a great boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,I have no complaints at all.
Ann Perkins,This place is great.
Ann Perkins,"Enough, please!"
Ann Perkins,"Yes, Tom, it is."
Ann Perkins,"On paper, this thing we have is pretty great."
Ann Perkins,See?
Ann Perkins,Everything is good.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,Including him.
Ann Perkins,There you go.
Ann Perkins,See?
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I would like that."
Ann Perkins,I'm weird with kids.
Ann Perkins,How much would that cost?
Ann Perkins,"I was listening to the radio on my way here, and I heard something very interesting."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, nerd."
Ann Perkins,That's very generous.
Ann Perkins,"Hello to you too, April."
Ann Perkins,"I am making a very important life decision, and you betrayed me."
Ann Perkins,That's nice.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, look at this pwetty, pwetty wittle beads."
Ann Perkins,They're not infants.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Larry."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you did that to me.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,Aren't you glad we came back and talked to her?
Ann Perkins,Diddly diddly diddly diddly swag.
Ann Perkins,I did it right.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I have that same suspicion."
Ann Perkins,I bet you are.
Ann Perkins,"But the Parks Department has done so much for me that if I can help them out in any way, I will."
Ann Perkins,I'm a terrible artist.
Ann Perkins,I would miss Leslie like crazy.
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna miss you too, Tom."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, yes."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay."
Ann Perkins,You look fancy.
Ann Perkins,Things are good.
Ann Perkins,The one?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,Aah! It actually smells really delicious.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you know, I read that he was."
Ann Perkins,Just think of us as your genies who can give you anything you want.
Ann Perkins,"And I can't really draw, so I just cut some stuff out of a magazine."
Ann Perkins,With dogs playing.
Ann Perkins,Nothing gross.
Ann Perkins,I just came to drop off some of the employee What is happening?
Ann Perkins,This is a great opportunity you have right now.
Ann Perkins,"Come on, Harold, look."
Ann Perkins,"You are sad drinking right now, and I need you to be happy drinking."
Ann Perkins,Maybe.
Ann Perkins,Are you a female bird?
Ann Perkins,"Well, since it's the Parks Department, I thought I would design a pretty park."
Ann Perkins,Um... Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, dudettes."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, maybe fake boobs run in his family."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, I tried."
Ann Perkins,I just bought it for 50 bucks.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and I have a great prop for the meeting."
Ann Perkins,Too cheesy?
Ann Perkins,You were down in the polls.
Ann Perkins,Like when we watch Grease together.
Ann Perkins,Your opponents were well funded and well organized.
Ann Perkins,Deal.
Ann Perkins,#NAME?
Ann Perkins,"This is the amount of sugar that the average Pawnee from soda, every month."
Ann Perkins,#NAME?
Ann Perkins,That's smart.
Ann Perkins,You must have known this would be a possibility.
Ann Perkins,Let's see yours.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,It's gross.
Ann Perkins,Your tax on soda would definitely lower diabetes in this town.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, what are you talking about?"
Ann Perkins,"Yes, and they're great."
Ann Perkins,It's cute.
Ann Perkins,It's dogs and people playing in a park.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, guard the door."
Ann Perkins,Use it.
Ann Perkins,No one leaves the Octagon.
Ann Perkins,I wrote this. You need to hear yourself read this.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, come on, Tweety Bird, let's get you some ice."
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Ann Perkins,"These are all your ongoing projects, everything you're currently working on for Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, how are we supposed to eat these rumps?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, except for Councilman Dexhart, who's a selfdescribed pervert."
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.
Ann Perkins,Anything is possible if we work hard enough.
Ann Perkins,This is private!
Ann Perkins,This is incredibly inappropriate.
Ann Perkins,"If I learned one thing from Leslie Knope it is we do not take ""No"" for an answer."
Ann Perkins,This is $8!
Ann Perkins,"First of all, don't apologize."
Ann Perkins,Let go!
Ann Perkins,Wha--what are you-- - What the hell?
Ann Perkins,Spin team!
Ann Perkins,You have things to do.
Ann Perkins,You have a month left.
Ann Perkins,Shh.
Ann Perkins,"And second of all, screw Harold."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Tom."
Ann Perkins,"So long, suckers!"
Ann Perkins,Let's go!
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
Ann Perkins,Bust in unannounced.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,You stoked about the weekend?
Ann Perkins,I dated an ultimate fighter.
Ann Perkins,We are not leaving here until you two figure this out.
Ann Perkins,"Ah, open's fine."
Ann Perkins,I don't think that he was.
Ann Perkins,"So, you are hitting on me."
Ann Perkins,Am I 65 years old?
Ann Perkins,It was like a thing he said.
Ann Perkins,Youngsters?
Ann Perkins,"I want a baby, that's it, accept it."
Ann Perkins,My idea of a perfect family does not require a soul mate.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,"Douche, you're up."
Ann Perkins,Keep going.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,It's got culture and music and tons of youngsters.
Ann Perkins,"Ben and I tried to help you, but as usual, you're the best person for the job."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we broke up."
Ann Perkins,"Well, luckily, you're with the person on earth who loves you the most."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we lived together for two years."
Ann Perkins,I'm pregnant and I have you in a headlock.
Ann Perkins,"And if you try to fight back, I will sue you."
Ann Perkins,"But you said that, you indicated that, oh my God this is happening again."
Ann Perkins,"I got home last night, and I thought I might go sledding."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm gonna leave the country."
Ann Perkins,What's in it for you?
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,Ha ha!
Ann Perkins,"Unlike April, I still do not know what my future holds with Chris."
Ann Perkins,I honestly think that you've built this into something that it wasn't.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, nothing."
Ann Perkins,It's not worth it.
Ann Perkins,"For me, I don't care."
Ann Perkins,For you.
Ann Perkins,"So, this isn't really about being right."
Ann Perkins,"""I told him that One Headlight By the Wallflowers isn't ""dancing"" music and he said ""Not with that attitude."
Ann Perkins,I am sure of it.
Ann Perkins,"Hopefully, that ridiculous sex will lead to a baby."
Ann Perkins,It's more about being supportive.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, maybe after, you wanna come meet me and Chris for a drink?"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, maybe you want to admit that you haven't been the greatest role model."
Ann Perkins,I have to move right?
Ann Perkins,It's really gross.
Ann Perkins,It's a tabloid.
Ann Perkins,"We're great, actually, and we're having a good time."
Ann Perkins,"All right, I'm gonna have to force this."
Ann Perkins,Apparently he wants April to move to Indianapolis with him.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,So you guys like Coldplay?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Pinewood, that's right."
Ann Perkins,"April, maybe you want to admit that you've been a little selfish and inconsiderate."
Ann Perkins,"You have to try to eat something, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I complete understand.
Ann Perkins,"And according to your rule, we can't date because you're my boss."
Ann Perkins,Where'd you go to school again?
Ann Perkins,And it's starting to bum me out.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you should see this."
Ann Perkins,Sex is ridiculous.
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Ann Perkins,"Chris, we dated for, like, three months a year ago."
Ann Perkins,What the hell?
Ann Perkins,I understand.
Ann Perkins,And I've made my decision.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"Good, 'cause, for a second there, I thought you were hitting on me in front of my boyfriend."
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Ron."
Ann Perkins,Of course.
Ann Perkins,Um I was making some cornhusk dolls for everyone but they kinda turned out wrong so they look like monsters.
Ann Perkins,And I honestly can't believe we ever dated.
Ann Perkins,"Like, what you're doing is really healthy, so keep the faith, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I set Leslie up on a date.
Ann Perkins,So that's something.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I will."
Ann Perkins,No need.
Ann Perkins,Don't hold back.
Ann Perkins,Did you put cream in this?
Ann Perkins,I choose Howard.
Ann Perkins,I haven't seen her in a while.
Ann Perkins,It sounds like you're exploiting the tragedy.
Ann Perkins,Oh no.
Ann Perkins,Oh no?
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's the Pawnee Sun."
Ann Perkins,I guess our awesome new park is on hold.
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Laura, for showing us around."
Ann Perkins,Nobody else has written about it.
Ann Perkins,"His name's Howard Tuttleman, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, if you're quiet."
Ann Perkins,"And I know he plays that obnoxious character on the radio, but he's a good guy, his family is healthy, and he is successful and smart."
Ann Perkins,I am.
Ann Perkins,It was way too easy to get this guy here.
Annabel Porter,"Well, this season, I'm intrigued by asymmetrical overalls, angora toothbrushes, and locally sourced Italian flip-flops."
Annabel Porter,Growth hacking.
Annabel Porter,But my Bloosh scouts have started trendtracking for the February zine blast.
Annabel Porter,"No, every two hours, we eat what I like to call a food tease, like an oat wedge or a seaweed lozenge."
Annabel Porter,"Now, come with me, as we binge-watch the future."
Annabel Porter,Gryzzl.
Annabel Porter,"Also, there's a flirty trend in beverages."
Annabel Porter,This month's trends are final.
Annabel Porter,Super Moon.
Annabel Porter,I was polishing my oyster forks with a cage-free olive oil rub.
Annabel Porter,I'm sorry I'm late for our coven.
Annabel Porter,Mm.
Annabel Porter,Hi.
Annabel Porter,"Yes, and now they will be made by thousands of tiny Chinese hands."
Annabel Porter,The average woman worries about what she looks like in a bathing suit.
Annabel Porter,Placemaking.
Annabel Porter,Innovative.
Annabel Porter,Fresh.
Annabel Porter,We don't do meals in my home.
Annabel Porter,There you go.
Annabel Porter,Great.
Annabel Porter,"First of all, Mozambique cashmere is the new cast-iron stove."
Annabel Porter,Disposable duvets.
Annabel Porter,We are going to put Swanson chairs in every six bedroom home in the Midwest.
Annabel Porter,It's genetic and unattainable.
Annabel Porter,You are about to make a ton of money.
Annabel Porter,So I get it.
Annabel Porter,I can't just throw a trend out.
Annabel Porter,So does my nanny.
Annabel Porter,"No, thank us."
Annabel Porter,"Hello, hello."
Annabel Porter,Thank you.
Annabel Porter,There he is.
Annabel Porter,I want to license your designs.
Annabel Porter,Are you guys doing well?
Annabel Porter,Oh.
Annabel Porter,"Now, try the hottest new craze, beef milk."
Annabel Porter,"Ronnie, one last time, have you reconsidered mass production?"
Annabel Porter,And I would be extremely jazzed to be part of the Gryzzl bid.
Annabel Porter,"I discovered Ron's chairs a few months ago, and what I absolutely love about a Swanson is you can really use it for anything."
Annabel Porter,Shall we discuss it in my yurt?
Annabel Porter,Great.
Annabel Porter,I can sell your chairs on my site.
Annabel Porter,"Well, I'm just a simple former phonebook model who found her calling."
Annabel Porter,"Well, that's too bad."
Annabel Porter,It no longer is.
Annabel Porter,It was.
Annabel Porter,"I have found some amazing new conflict free paella recipes, and, luckily, my favorite fishmonger now makes house calls."
Annabel Porter,Hi.
Annabel Porter,"So, I just sign here?"
Annabel Porter,But my fave new item is a deliciously bold chair
Annabel Porter,"So, you've had soy milk and almond milk."
Annabel Porter,"Hello, hello."
Annabel Porter,By local artist Ron Swanson.
Annabel Porter,It's me.
Annabel Porter,I'm here.
Annabel Porter,Make it a rustic accent piece in your solarium.
Annabel Porter,Mmm?
Annabel Porter,This party is over.
Annabel Porter,"You know, I'm not perfect."
Annabel Porter,No.
Annabel Porter,"Even better, use it as a focal point in your yoga tent."
Annabel Porter,"Well, this calls for a celebratory dram of aged grappa."
Annabel Porter,"Oh, no, I am not done with you, you wicked little so-and-so."
Annabel Porter,It's like almond milk that's been squeezed through tiny holes in living cows.
Annabel Porter,I'll have them stop by your store.
Annabel Porter,I thought you said you were doing well.
Annabel Porter,It's an interesting idea.
Annabel Porter,Smashing.

April Ludgate,"Hey, there was a message for you on the work voicemail."
April Ludgate,"Councilman Dexhart wants to meet with you at 9:00 p.m., the Boardwalk Lounge."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, okay, cool."
April Ludgate,Who's Matlock?
April Ludgate,At 2:00 a.m. on cable access.
April Ludgate,And quiet.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Thanks, but now that it's legal, I've kind of lost interest."
April Ludgate,"Seriously, I think Andy Dwyer makes a better real cop than Bert Macklin."
April Ludgate,I want to work here.
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,"Actually, Bert Macklin kinda made that little boy cry."
April Ludgate,What? No! We can't let them beat us.
April Ludgate,At the Foundation.
April Ludgate,"Well, it takes a snake to know a snake."
April Ludgate,You're a mouse eater.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,There's no one else to ask.
April Ludgate,Sounds like you took a snake and twisted it like a rag until its blood and guts came out.
April Ludgate,At least you're kind of young.
April Ludgate,It's strong.
April Ludgate,I want to be like Alyssa.
April Ludgate,"I want to tell people what to do, and then send them far away from me."
April Ludgate,You want everything a thousand times more than I do.
April Ludgate,"This is a small, loser town with loser people, and Tom's, like, at least semi-cool."
April Ludgate,Stop.
April Ludgate,It's perfect.
April Ludgate,"And you can see that-- Andy, where is it?"
April Ludgate,"Now the name ""Goliath"" means ""giant."""
April Ludgate,Pawnee's only a tenhour drive.
April Ludgate,"This week I brought one of the scariest, weirdest animals in the whole world, A goliath bird eating tarantula."
April Ludgate,Road trip?
April Ludgate,They're going really well.
April Ludgate,Why? It makes sense to me.
April Ludgate,That's right.
April Ludgate,"So, about that--"
April Ludgate,It's Friday.
April Ludgate,Everyone is being so nice to me lately.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,It's weird.
April Ludgate,I feel like I need to take a shower in pig's blood to wash all the niceness off me.
April Ludgate,Later.
April Ludgate,I bet you guys would have a good time.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Organizing files or taking a spontaneous road trip to surprise Leslie?
April Ludgate,"Dude, 30 years from now, when you're on your deathbed, what are you going to remember?"
April Ludgate,"You deceived me for two straight days, and you eat mice."
April Ludgate,So since it's your final show I wanted to do one last extra special April's Animal Corner.
April Ludgate,"So, will you help me?"
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,Oh My God.
April Ludgate,And it hits everything on my list.
April Ludgate,All right.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I gotta go home, too."
April Ludgate,That's why I'm so lively and colorful.
April Ludgate,"Creative problem solving, working one-on-one--"
April Ludgate,"You guys are such close friends, it's lame."
April Ludgate,Somewhere.
April Ludgate,Soâ¦
April Ludgate,You're going to be just fine.
April Ludgate,Nothing.
April Ludgate,I didn't tell her yet.
April Ludgate,I love it.
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,I wanted to see if you thought it was a good idea first.
April Ludgate,What? Bad idea?
April Ludgate,We're going to get married and I'm pregnant with his child.
April Ludgate,And always here when you need it.
April Ludgate,"Yes, you do."
April Ludgate,I assume.
April Ludgate,Or whatever.
April Ludgate,Don't try to bond with me.
April Ludgate,But we do not want to win this way.
April Ludgate,And you turned me into someone with goals and ambition.
April Ludgate,"And you probably miss your lover, Chris."
April Ludgate,I'm great.
April Ludgate,I just want to see if I can do it.
April Ludgate,"Can you handle, like, 20 cars or a double decker party bus?"
April Ludgate,Yes!
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,"""Why is my cup so tiny?"""
April Ludgate,The pedophile?
April Ludgate,"Liar, I don't even drink that crap."
April Ludgate,Morgan?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Leave Ann alone.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's actually about death and the city."
April Ludgate,This is none of your business.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Mouse eater.
April Ludgate,"But you can make wine in your toilet and fight people, which is a super cool way to live."
April Ludgate,Isn't that that creepy guy?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, and if they do, you'll just go to jail."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,I found this crazy woman on the street and she won't leave me alone.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Here's that report you wanted, boss."
April Ludgate,"I know you normally hate foundations, but this one I think you'll actually like."
April Ludgate,Or I could set myself on fire and create a diversion?
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Wow, Chris."
April Ludgate,Your gender equality commission is a real sausage fest.
April Ludgate,Do you want me to postpone the rest?
April Ludgate,How's the street parking at your house?
April Ludgate,It's funny because it has 30 different fonts on it and you only like one.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, I had to miss the ""Memorable Rain Gutters of Washington"" walking tour, so this better be good."
April Ludgate,Aah!
April Ludgate,But he's probably too busy cleaning gum out of his coat pockets.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Which is really the only reason why I'm even thinking about what I really want.
April Ludgate,And I just want to say thank you.
April Ludgate,"When I started working for you, I was aimless and just thought everything was stupid and lame."
April Ludgate,It's not a basketball court any more.
April Ludgate,"Okay, sorry."
April Ludgate,"He's 23, he's kind of my boyfriend, he's gay."
April Ludgate,And I love you very much.
April Ludgate,Which is why I have decided not to turn you into a sea urchin.
April Ludgate,Which I could do because I am an actual witch with powers and I'm evil--
April Ludgate,"Now, take your shoes off and wear them like mittens."
April Ludgate,"Last year we got drunk and he took me to the Ice Capades, and I didn't get him anything."
April Ludgate,And I hate everything.
April Ludgate,You told me you wanted a dog park.
April Ludgate,Please.
April Ludgate,"Can you Photoshop your life with better decisions, Jerry?"
April Ludgate,"Perfect, but just one thing."
April Ludgate,"Well, soon it won't matter."
April Ludgate,You don't know that.
April Ludgate,"Okay, turn around."
April Ludgate,"Leslie, what are you doing?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Pinwheel.
April Ludgate,You lied to me.
April Ludgate,That's not fair.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I would.
April Ludgate,Because I'm about to say something serious and I can't do it if I have to look you in the eye.
April Ludgate,Do you like it?
April Ludgate,"That's right, and they're gonna keep using it until there's an actual park nearby."
April Ludgate,Do you want me to seduce Perd Hapley?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I'm
April Ludgate,This never happened.
April Ludgate,Forget it.
April Ludgate,"My cousin Hesen, he beat off five cops on that stuff."
April Ludgate,You can move anything on angel dust.
April Ludgate,You do?
April Ludgate,Because I don't know.
April Ludgate,Probably.
April Ludgate,"Ann would never do anything to piss you off, Leslie."
April Ludgate,"Look, all we have to do is get some PCP."
April Ludgate,"Those guys suck, okay? We have to prove them wrong."
April Ludgate,Tom is the only cool person in the office.
April Ludgate,We want to win.
April Ludgate,They're amazing.
April Ludgate,My favorite Jerry moment was when he ate a bowl of glue.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, at least it took a million hours, and it was 180 degrees, and we starved to death."
April Ludgate,"Leslie, I want the Pawnee Commons as bad as you do."
April Ludgate,"Actually, that's not true."
April Ludgate,"Hey, Johnny!"
April Ludgate,"No, Leslie, we do not want to tie."
April Ludgate,Really? That would be awesome.
April Ludgate,"Get out, Jerry."
April Ludgate,Definitely.
April Ludgate,"He's always talking about overthrowing the government, but he never does that."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"What? Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Walk away.
April Ludgate,Mouse eater.
April Ludgate,My mom is Puerto Rican.
April Ludgate,I had an idea.
April Ludgate,"I don't know, maybe he's in the bathroom or something."
April Ludgate,"Or maybe he did tell me, but he was so stupid and boring that I wasn't listening, and either way, it was his fault, because he was stupid and I hated him."
April Ludgate,He says a lot of things.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ron."
April Ludgate,It's an ice skating rink.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,"And I fully support it, as would the rest of the youth in the community."
April Ludgate,Wait a minute.
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,"Here, catch this."
April Ludgate,To the man!
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,"Like, tied up, naked, in your basement?"
April Ludgate,"I was thinking, like, a crazy rock star vibe!"
April Ludgate,Sorry.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but who cares?"
April Ludgate,Ugh! Mom.
April Ludgate,"Terrific's not more than amazing, Jerry."
April Ludgate,Shut up!
April Ludgate,"if you're lost, you can look and you will find me time after time if you fall, I will catch you time after time time after time time after time."
April Ludgate,You know what?
April Ludgate,"Um, I miss Andy."
April Ludgate,The stupid guy I called to book this place didn't tell me they took off the basketball floor for a hockey game.
April Ludgate,I used to play softball in high school.
April Ludgate,I know exactly what I want to do.
April Ludgate,And writing Star Trek fan fiction does not count.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,"Hey, are you busy?"
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,Be stronger.
April Ludgate,"Uh, I'm a youth in the community and I think a new park is a great idea."
April Ludgate,Maybe it's time for Bert Macklin to hang up his shades.
April Ludgate,And some privacy to violate!
April Ludgate,What are you looking for in a date anyway?
April Ludgate,We take people that don't know what they wanna do and then put them to work doing cool stuff all over the world.
April Ludgate,You don't add up.
April Ludgate,"What are you doing here, and who is this sorry charlie?"
April Ludgate,We could buy my parents' house and evict them.
April Ludgate,I'm Janet Snakehole.
April Ludgate,I wish we had 46 million dollars.
April Ludgate,"I demand answers, and I want them now."
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,It's like talking about people behind their backs.
April Ludgate,It's not mean if he doesn't know about it.
April Ludgate,"Okay, sorry."
April Ludgate,Drop the suit.
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,Everybody wins.
April Ludgate,"Jerry told me to, so it's super crucial."
April Ludgate,You monster.
April Ludgate,"All right, so"
April Ludgate,I just heard.
April Ludgate,Are you okay?
April Ludgate,"Game's over, councilman."
April Ludgate,That's not what I saw.
April Ludgate,That's not possible.
April Ludgate,How about Life is a Picnic with You?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"No, look at me."
April Ludgate,Two bucks apiece.
April Ludgate,"Because I told him about the dog park idea, and he loves it."
April Ludgate,Wow.
April Ludgate,Seriously? Okay.
April Ludgate,"Sinbad, wow."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Why, isn't it Bert Macklin?"
April Ludgate,"Say, thanks, chum."
April Ludgate,That's good.
April Ludgate,I'll get those papers delivered for you.
April Ludgate,Don't worry about it.
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,Shut up.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna murder you.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Post haste.
April Ludgate,"Honey, we're already married."
April Ludgate,The other tour guide never said anything about that.
April Ludgate,We should sue Jamm's parents for spawning a human turdburger.
April Ludgate,That guy is the worst.
April Ludgate,Stop.
April Ludgate,You hate this show.
April Ludgate,Found it.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I would do that."
April Ludgate,Confirming what?
April Ludgate,I thought raccoons were supposed to be nocturnal.
April Ludgate,It means that the only reason you brought me here is to distract me from the dog park.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,We're married.
April Ludgate,Parks and Rec.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I tried to Photoshop it to make it look like they were happy.
April Ludgate,It was really hard.
April Ludgate,"Let's do it, trash people!"
April Ludgate,Their mouths are so old.
April Ludgate,That sounds fun.
April Ludgate,Would you like these men in your catalog?
April Ludgate,You made those losers very happy.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, here's a guy."
April Ludgate,I don't think we should see each other.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Do you have space for, like, a huge circus tent?"
April Ludgate,"It's because whenever I see you talk to Ann or talk about Ann, I feel like you still have feelings for her."
April Ludgate,I don't care about that.
April Ludgate,Me too.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, totally."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"You know what, I have to go talk to Councilman Jamm right now."
April Ludgate,Let's feed the beast!
April Ludgate,"Eighteen bucks each, 40 dollars for the set."
April Ludgate,Does this look familiar?
April Ludgate,"Listen, what I said this afternoon was stupid."
April Ludgate,Okay? I totally want to go out with you.
April Ludgate,"Maybe it was me, but I'll never tell you where they are."
April Ludgate,"I'll go, too."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,That was nice.
April Ludgate,What's your favorite part?
April Ludgate,"Hurry, Tom, let's get you into surgery!"
April Ludgate,I just have to get my stuff from the office.
April Ludgate,"Tom's funny, and he'd treat you well."
April Ludgate,"Ooh, where'd you come up with that idea?"
April Ludgate,Because I didn't think March 31st existed.
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,I'm sorry that I outsmarted you at every turn.
April Ludgate,Orin's my role model.
April Ludgate,That's what you do when you
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"And I know I have a lot to learn from you, and I'm sorry that I disrespected your stupid dream."
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,She has to use prescription strength deodorant.
April Ludgate,I wanna make out with him and chew his eyebrows off.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,"Wow, that is so sweet."
April Ludgate,And expensive.
April Ludgate,I'm an eyebrow girl.
April Ludgate,This is the best day of my life.
April Ludgate,"That's because every time someone calls and requests a meeting with you, I always schedule it for March 31st."
April Ludgate,"You want a good date, why not ask out the only guy that's made you smile tonight?"
April Ludgate,"Thirty days has September, April, March and November--"
April Ludgate,He's sweet.
April Ludgate,Right.
April Ludgate,It's not.
April Ludgate,You're being weird.
April Ludgate,I wished for his happiness to go away.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"Listen up, people."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Why aren't we moving?
April Ludgate,93
April Ludgate,Yay!
April Ludgate,This is very serious.
April Ludgate,You should just ask him out for a drink.
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,I wanna hear what's on it.
April Ludgate,I want to listen to it.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,"Yes, I want to listen to it."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,So?
April Ludgate,"So, you know how you love me because you haven't had a single meeting with anyone since I became your assistant?"
April Ludgate,Why aren't we moving?
April Ludgate,"My problem is you, Smellis."
April Ludgate,"Ellis hates you, and he has herpes."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like I should trust you out of all people right now."
April Ludgate,Good morning.
April Ludgate,"Jerry, if you're eating, you're not listening."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"I went to high school with her, and she was super mean to me, and now I know that she dyes her hair."
April Ludgate,Never mind.
April Ludgate,Jerry Dinner
April Ludgate,Living in this town's like living in the devil's butt crack.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,I don't have anything else to do.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"Yes, mercy me."
April Ludgate,"He's gonna support my motion at the city council meeting tomorrow, and he gave me a really cool dental mirror to check out my molars."
April Ludgate,He thinks it's a great idea.
April Ludgate,"Hey, can I get these?"
April Ludgate,Don't look at me.
April Ludgate,This is Stacy Knoblauch's house.
April Ludgate,I knew that wench wasn't naturally blonde.
April Ludgate,"Well, I think you do."
April Ludgate,So... That's a problem for me.
April Ludgate,"It's been a pleasure serving with you, son."
April Ludgate,I might be a wizard.
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,I don't care.
April Ludgate,"Ben told you to finish the website, and if you don't do it, I swear to God, I'm gonna murder you in your sleep."
April Ludgate,So we're looking for a racist ghost with black hair who likes shoeshines.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you know how people say that you should give gifts that you would want to get yourself?"
April Ludgate,Do you want help or not?
April Ludgate,What would you want?
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Why are there six people outside who say they're waiting to meet with me?
April Ludgate,Mmmhmm.
April Ludgate,This lawsuit is definitely getting thrown out.
April Ludgate,The super old one.
April Ludgate,That guy is a joke.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you're not gonna win $50 million, you freak."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that is so interesting to me because I'm a map salesman."
April Ludgate,"Guys, where's the old shoeshine stand from upstairs?"
April Ludgate,And you'll never have my body either.
April Ludgate,"Natalie, it's your sister."
April Ludgate,Please say head.
April Ludgate,The truth is stupid.
April Ludgate,I was watching Ann with Tom at the dance and she seemed to be having a good time.
April Ludgate,I only tell the truth when it makes me sound like I'm lying.
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not."
April Ludgate,But I don't know what you're talking about.
April Ludgate,I was just messing around.
April Ludgate,Because I set them up.
April Ludgate,So I went over to talk to her.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm sorry I drew those pictures of you."
April Ludgate,I can't wait till my internship is over so I can get the hell out of here.
April Ludgate,"And if it doesn't, I hope it works out with someone."
April Ludgate,Why do you have so many soundtracks?
April Ludgate,"Soundtrack to Pulp Fiction, soundtrack to Singles, soundtrack to Grosse Pointe Blank."
April Ludgate,We'll have triple sex with him.
April Ludgate,Somebody punch someone!
April Ludgate,"They provide for us, and we must obey them because they are our masters."
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"Ugh, whatever."
April Ludgate,Nothing.
April Ludgate,Just kidding.
April Ludgate,"No, Ron, he only has three legs!"
April Ludgate,I don't want to go any more.
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,Eww.
April Ludgate,I hid it in here years ago.
April Ludgate,"Stop leaning on my arm, Andy."
April Ludgate,It's Ron's key.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,I told you.
April Ludgate,12%.
April Ludgate,It's not money.
April Ludgate,"You know what, I think men are better than women."
April Ludgate,"Actually, no."
April Ludgate,"Chris, Jerry's making us look at dirty pictures on his computer."
April Ludgate,Can I get a shine?
April Ludgate,Get a drink.
April Ludgate,"Hey, why don't you sell your band's CDs here?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,See you in ten minutes.
April Ludgate,Three weeks.
April Ludgate,"Wait, I think Champion has to go to the bathroom."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm 25."
April Ludgate,Thank God.
April Ludgate,Are you a ghost?
April Ludgate,I totally know where the key is.
April Ludgate,But it means that we have to move to Washington.
April Ludgate,It's definitely the job I wanted.
April Ludgate,Don't know.
April Ludgate,And I start in a couple months.
April Ludgate,I'm 24.
April Ludgate,"No old jokes, please."
April Ludgate,No
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Hey, I know another bar that always lets me in, if you just wanna go there."
April Ludgate,"Councilman Dexhart, you're involved in yet another scandal?"
April Ludgate,"""Woof, woof."" Bark."
April Ludgate,"That's crazier than Mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus."
April Ludgate,"Just have a nice night with Ben, and forget about this."
April Ludgate,"I'm 1,000% sure he'd say yes."
April Ludgate,Sometimes the confidence confuses people.
April Ludgate,I hope it works out with Chris.
April Ludgate,"We start chewing now, we can finish before the sun comes up."
April Ludgate,Mm.
April Ludgate,I was talking to Joey.
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,I just heard one hag booing.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, you'll never land a beau with that domineering tone."
April Ludgate,I got you something too.
April Ludgate,We must always walk behind the men.
April Ludgate,"I come in, like, two hours late because I had to finish watching Swimfan because it was on, and everyone, like, jumped down my throat."
April Ludgate,So I guess we are celebrating that you trusted me and I let you down.
April Ludgate,Maybe we should just eat the refrigerator.
April Ludgate,Yes!
April Ludgate,Yes!
April Ludgate,Justin?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,It's cool.
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"If I were 300 years older, Councilman."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, can't you do anything wrong, Jerry?"
April Ludgate,I totally get what you mean.
April Ludgate,"Oh, here's something."
April Ludgate,"Leslie, members of the Council, I believe that municipal lot 48 should be a dog park."
April Ludgate,Your help and general nonawfulness is much appreciated.
April Ludgate,It's a dead end.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,No more clues.
April Ludgate,I wanna get into some garbage.
April Ludgate,Let's get rolling.
April Ludgate,"It isn't much, but it's something to remember us by."
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,"Attention, everyone."
April Ludgate,Bye!
April Ludgate,"Well, some of the boys chipped in and we got you This."
April Ludgate,Do you understand me?
April Ludgate,Ronny?
April Ludgate,Let's rock this.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you're totally right."
April Ludgate,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,"It's, like, about lame werewolves and vampires and stuff."
April Ludgate,"Okay, Ann, since you're such a genius, what do we do now?"
April Ludgate,"It's a movie, but I've never seen it."
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,"""Benji's Cool Times Summer Jamz Mix."""
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,But that's-- That'd be cool.
April Ludgate,I'm not stupid.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, do we have to do something nice now?"
April Ludgate,"Like, a torso or a head?"
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Or body parts?
April Ludgate,You ever found a dead body in the trash?
April Ludgate,"Okay, well, we all told the truth, and Jamm's definitely going to win."
April Ludgate,15
April Ludgate,What? Look how generous they're being with each other.
April Ludgate,I love you too.
April Ludgate,"Okay, bye."
April Ludgate,I know where you live. 14th street right?
April Ludgate,I don't want to do this in front of her.
April Ludgate,I love garbage.
April Ludgate,"I'm gonna get a melon baller and scoop your eyes out and eat them, and your congressman uncle is gonna have to buy you a dog to drag your eyeless face around."
April Ludgate,Pick me up or I'm gonna draw all over your jeans.
April Ludgate,"I use the wooden stirs to push my cuticles back, everyone knows that Jerry."
April Ludgate,I've never heard him threaten to hurt anyone or anything.
April Ludgate,"The guy's, like, a vegetarian."
April Ludgate,I want one.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Road trip!
April Ludgate,"""Cordially, April."""
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,That's awesome.
April Ludgate,Do it.
April Ludgate,Neat.
April Ludgate,We're not going.
April Ludgate,It was eight years ago.
April Ludgate,"""If you are looking for Ron's key, I moved it, and you'll never find it."""
April Ludgate,This looks like an ad for nothing.
April Ludgate,Reorganization of Local Auditing Systems.
April Ludgate,"Ann, who are you lying to?"
April Ludgate,How old is that handkerchief?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Thank you, Councilman Jamm."
April Ludgate,I'm not.
April Ludgate,Just kidding.
April Ludgate,Doing what?
April Ludgate,Whiskey.
April Ludgate,"No, I want to go to the Glitter Factory."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"I had it in a safe place, and then I moved it to protect it, and I don't remember where."
April Ludgate,This tour guide is the most amazing tour guide there ever was.
April Ludgate,That does make me feel a little better.
April Ludgate,"Look at him, he's like a big, old, soft teddy bear."
April Ludgate,"His nickname around the office is ""SoftyPants McHuggable."""
April Ludgate,"Please, step up."
April Ludgate,I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,$200 cash up front.
April Ludgate,"You didn't always play by the rules, but damn it, you were a hell of an agent."
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry to see you go, Macklin."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,My house is not even on a street.
April Ludgate,Yes!
April Ludgate,Ow! You're hurting me!
April Ludgate,It's his worst nightmare.
April Ludgate,A key to Ron's house is lost in a government building.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,Because this tree reminds me of you.
April Ludgate,We may not be big And our mayor wears a wig But at least the raccoon infestation is under control
April Ludgate,"Well, I think we have our answer."
April Ludgate,Where is it?
April Ludgate,"Hello, Ann."
April Ludgate,"Hey, Leslie."
April Ludgate,"Hey, Oliver."
April Ludgate,"He chopped off both of his arms, so he wouldn't leave any fingerprints."
April Ludgate,Merry Christmas.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,"Your kids are, like, surprisingly awesome."
April Ludgate,We got you a gift.
April Ludgate,I actually like that one.
April Ludgate,"Mmm, so romantic."
April Ludgate,"Oh, sorry, I forgot."
April Ludgate,A little too quiet.
April Ludgate,"Then next time you see me, I'll be a stranger."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Hi, Jerry."
April Ludgate,and I'll list terrible things to bring you back down.
April Ludgate,"Nothing, it's just adults are boring, and I hate them, and I don't want to buy all this stupid boring adult stuff and become boring adults."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Or yours.
April Ludgate,I don't need your sympathy.
April Ludgate,Hadn't thought about it that way.
April Ludgate,"Um, here."
April Ludgate,"You've had all night to get something out of him, Dwyer, we gotta let him go."
April Ludgate,Maybe you should see one of the other doctors.
April Ludgate,"Did you use an egg donor, or give Chris a hall pass for a night?"
April Ludgate,But I want it.
April Ludgate,"Sir, if you want to make a donation, you have to-- Yeah."
April Ludgate,"Well, we'll hang out then."
April Ludgate,"You're never gonna break him, Dwyer."
April Ludgate,He's a psychopath.
April Ludgate,"Once again, I don't believe you."
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Take these tickets.
April Ludgate,It's quiet.
April Ludgate,A video of me drinking some of that wine you stole.
April Ludgate,Isn't this how all great Bert Macklin cases start?
April Ludgate,This is a nightmare.
April Ludgate,I hate talking to people about things.
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm still proud of you."
April Ludgate,You worked hard and you got really close.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,And I never clean up.
April Ludgate,I'm grouchy.
April Ludgate,"They're movie tickets, Chris."
April Ludgate,Good.
April Ludgate,Stop.
April Ludgate,Mine too.
April Ludgate,This is why I prefer nightmares.
April Ludgate,"You saved us, Donna."
April Ludgate,How?
April Ludgate,A hundred.
April Ludgate,"Yes, it is."
April Ludgate,I love you.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Twenty.
April Ludgate,Let's go.
April Ludgate,"Smallpox, botched surgery, snails crawling out of your mouth."
April Ludgate,Wait a minute.
April Ludgate,You're going to make me cry.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,My piece is truly going to capture the spirit of Pawnee.
April Ludgate,It's going to be fun.
April Ludgate,Can I use a weird voice and try to freak people out?
April Ludgate,"Yes, I am 21 years old today."
April Ludgate,That could be fun.
April Ludgate,"Yes, just do it already."
April Ludgate,I think we found that in Ben.
April Ludgate,It doesn't.
April Ludgate,Which is the age that pretty much everyone agrees makes you an adult.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, good point."
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,I don't wanna talk to you.
April Ludgate,"Okay, cool."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,"Look, you won't have to pay any extra money, okay? And don't ever call me ""ma'am"" again."
April Ludgate,40% wiill be coming from our corporate partners and another 30%
April Ludgate,Ew.
April Ludgate,Pillow pet.
April Ludgate,Next question.
April Ludgate,Slap chop.
April Ludgate,I think Ann and him would be cute together.
April Ludgate,Oh my god a gopher pick up
April Ludgate,"I'm not going to show up in that picture anyway, because I'm a vampire."
April Ludgate,"Uh, good question."
April Ludgate,This is Derek.
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, marshmallow shooter"
April Ludgate,Where did you get that?
April Ludgate,We're just friends.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, there's not gonna be a topless park, Harris."
April Ludgate,Miracle hand repair.
April Ludgate,"I dig your groovy tunes, man."
April Ludgate,Break's over.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have a thing that makes sherbet, we need five of those."
April Ludgate,"Who's not invited, then?"
April Ludgate,"I put a poisonous gas in one of these balloons, so if any of them pops, you may die."
April Ludgate,Big top cookie.
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have all the as seen on TV stuff."
April Ludgate,"Yay, Ann's here."
April Ludgate,"Right now, drinking wine is winning--"
April Ludgate,Shake weight.
April Ludgate,Iron gym.
April Ludgate,And I brought a bachelor.
April Ludgate,"Nobody wants your creepy stoner eyes staring at them while they're enjoying a park, okay? Stop being gross."
April Ludgate,Yup.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Wait what about the magic bullet?
April Ludgate,"Well Last week he was supposed to buy gas, but instead he bought novelty cookie cutters."
April Ludgate,I can't do this meeting without my Leslie stuff.
April Ludgate,I don't have my Leslie pantsuit or my Leslie headband or my Leslie notes.
April Ludgate,This bag is full of Fruit RollUps and baseball cards.
April Ludgate,1000 to 7.
April Ludgate,This is the wrong bag.
April Ludgate,We got the marshmallow shooter.
April Ludgate,I'm fine.
April Ludgate,"Um, how are you?"
April Ludgate,"Oh, $900."
April Ludgate,"I don't know, eight cents?"
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,But I make out with him when I'm drunk sometimes.
April Ludgate,"Okay, can you give me that bag? I have to go change into my Leslie suit."
April Ludgate,"Yay, best wedding ever."
April Ludgate,Sure we did.
April Ludgate,That's amazing.
April Ludgate,I love you.
April Ludgate,It's really nice.
April Ludgate,You guys are really adorable.
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna get some punch.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,He's like the gayest person I've ever met.
April Ludgate,Mighty Putty.
April Ludgate,"No, that's the groom"
April Ludgate,"Andy, that's the groom."
April Ludgate,I'm sure she'll get over it if you just say you're sorry though.
April Ludgate,So when am I gonna meet your new lover?
April Ludgate,"Okay, so we're ready out there."
April Ludgate,For your wedding or whatever.
April Ludgate,"Yes, it all came together."
April Ludgate,"Uh, whatever."
April Ludgate,Um Shh.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, these old bags paid for some entertainment."
April Ludgate,Who cares?
April Ludgate,All of them.
April Ludgate,I think you're gonna have to make an end run.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,This gridlock drives me nuts.
April Ludgate,I don't know what you're talking about.
April Ludgate,"All I said to him was that this other band was better, but I don't know why he got all mad, because it's like an indisputable fact that they're better."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I know, I bought another one because I thought that maybe you, me, and Andy could go to the movies sometime."
April Ludgate,They're a real band.
April Ludgate,Wait.
April Ludgate,"Andy's in there talking to a reporter, literally kissing his own biceps and you're telling me he might not be a hero, but just some jerk that goes around tackling random possums?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I've gotta help Leslie find the truth.
April Ludgate,"Not because I'm pissed at Andy, which I'm not."
April Ludgate,Because I care so deeply about possums.
April Ludgate,Because they're so adorable.
April Ludgate,He doesn't think I like Mouse Rat.
April Ludgate,"Hey, if you want a song from Andy Dwyer, lead singer of Mouse Rat, you should know he doesn't get out of bed for less than $1,000."
April Ludgate,You know?
April Ludgate,"Ah, well, fear not."
April Ludgate,"No offense, but it's a giant picture of a park."
April Ludgate,That's not art.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Yeah?
April Ludgate,You don't even work here.
April Ludgate,"I kind of set up Tom and Ann, and now they won't stop asking me for advice, which is a really bad move on their part, because I really don't care what happens to them Or anyone."
April Ludgate,Go right to the Commissioner on this one.
April Ludgate,I've gotta work at the Senior Center Valentine's Day Dance thing.
April Ludgate,I can't.
April Ludgate,"""P.S. Please hurry."""
April Ludgate,Any kid could do that.
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,Between the normal Parks budget and our corporate partners
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Sold.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry, it's probably a typo, because it probably should've said, ""You have a cube butt."""
April Ludgate,Andy.
April Ludgate,And that's saying something.
April Ludgate,Pass.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I wanted to see what your face looked like when I said no."
April Ludgate,It was totally worth it.
April Ludgate,Love you.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Can you just take a look at these photos and make sure that it's Fairway Frank?
April Ludgate,"Ever since Andy failed the police academy exam, his selfesteem has hit rock bottom."
April Ludgate,He's usually happy and sweaty.
April Ludgate,You know what?
April Ludgate,This sounds like fun.
April Ludgate,"Babe, come on."
April Ludgate,Let's help him.
April Ludgate,It'll be fun.
April Ludgate,He's always sad and sweaty.
April Ludgate,It isn't.
April Ludgate,Mmm.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that sounds good, but I can't because I have to go do something that actually matters."
April Ludgate,"Cube butt, cube butt."
April Ludgate,"Love, Andy."""
April Ludgate,"So now, I guess we're Park Pals."
April Ludgate,"Now, if you all would kindly look under your chairs, you will find a special surprise a flyer with details about the project, and Friendship bands that I've made for each and every one of you."
April Ludgate,Just take the stupid tickets.
April Ludgate,"As Eleanor Roosevelt once said to Betty Ford ""Hillary Clinton is great."""
April Ludgate,And welcome to a public forum about the Pawnee Commons.
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate from the Parks Department.
April Ludgate,"Hello, everyone."
April Ludgate,"Dude, seriously, leave me out of this."
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,That's cool.
April Ludgate,I'm really happy for you.
April Ludgate,So I thought I would ask you.
April Ludgate,Mouse Rat rules.
April Ludgate,Ann's blows.
April Ludgate,"I just put the stupid flash drive in, and then I tried to drag everything over, and"
April Ludgate,I don't think there are topless parks.
April Ludgate,"Oh, wow."
April Ludgate,I love him so much.
April Ludgate,I was her for two hours and I want to die.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I"
April Ludgate,I just don't know how Leslie can be Leslie all the time.
April Ludgate,"Two of them were me and Andy, and one of them said ""Farts McCool."""
April Ludgate,We only got four signatures.
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out of your butt.
April Ludgate,"Um, crappy."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, what was it like?"
April Ludgate,Dave Matthews Band.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, bummer."
April Ludgate,"Look, there's a picture."
April Ludgate,"""I've been wearing a bandana as underwear for three days now."""
April Ludgate,It's a gesture.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
April Ludgate,I don't know why you would want to.
April Ludgate,What should I do?
April Ludgate,Dude stop rooting for the other team.
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,"Uh, dental hygienist who's also a medium, so I can clean people's teeth and tell them when they're going to die."
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,"Because I was waiting for my sister and I was bored, and my hair looked really good."
April Ludgate,Sick.
April Ludgate,Should I wear a blonde wig?
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out of your mouth.
April Ludgate,I was just telling Andy that I'm proud of him.
April Ludgate,God.
April Ludgate,We're outside.
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out out of your mouth.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Andy.
April Ludgate,"They're, like, 8 bucks."
April Ludgate,Win what?
April Ludgate,He was the one that did all the cleaning and throwing away and stuff.
April Ludgate,He's a weirdo.
April Ludgate,And then this is a human-sized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one.
April Ludgate,"And it will be spinning and there will be, like, a fat guy in it all the time, like, screaming and, like, eating raw beef and, like, bleeding."
April Ludgate,"After this we won't have to go to the doctor for, like, ten years, because we're smart."
April Ludgate,"And, like, blood will, like, come out of his mouth and stuff."
April Ludgate,"And that'll be, like, right next to the mural."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, you drove us here."
April Ludgate,"It'll be like a big, flatscreen TV, and it will play looped video of knee surgeries."
April Ludgate,"If you have to ask, you don't get it."
April Ludgate,My thoughts exactly.
April Ludgate,Yeah!
April Ludgate,My instinct is to be mean to you.
April Ludgate,Sorry.
April Ludgate,Your last resort is probably gonna be City Council.
April Ludgate,"I didn't realize you were a marriage counselor, Ann."
April Ludgate,I have no idea what I was saying.
April Ludgate,And this is a TV screen.
April Ludgate,"First, a bunch of rats made out of garbage."
April Ludgate,"So, this is a multimedia project."
April Ludgate,"I actually stole it from his office, but whatever."
April Ludgate,Jerry.
April Ludgate,Why don't you put that murinal in the men's room so people can murinate all over it?
April Ludgate,"Well, Burly moved out."
April Ludgate,Can you throw that in the trash can?
April Ludgate,I guess.
April Ludgate,"If you get glasses, I'll divorce you."
April Ludgate,I like his face the way it is.
April Ludgate,Playing a show with the greatest band ever.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Living out my dream.
April Ludgate,You were in the pit We all were in the pit The pit I was in the pit You were in the pit We all were in the pit
April Ludgate,The pit
April Ludgate,"No, he's not getting glasses."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, his favorite movie is Dances With Wolves."
April Ludgate,"Andy is totally mad at me right now, and I don't know how to deal with him."
April Ludgate,So get up there.
April Ludgate,"Hey, you should play that song The Way You Look Tonight."
April Ludgate,Ow.
April Ludgate,They're number one on iTunes.
April Ludgate,It's a Tudor mansion.
April Ludgate,So untie me!
April Ludgate,Here's a great one.
April Ludgate,He's not going to like it very much.
April Ludgate,"It's got seven rooms, four bathrooms."
April Ludgate,Let's bring the library down.
April Ludgate,"So, what kind of place are you looking for?"
April Ludgate,"Now, I bet you feel like a jerk."
April Ludgate,I have the swine flu.
April Ludgate,How dare you?
April Ludgate,I want to be your assistant.
April Ludgate,"Is this gonna be one of those cool bachelorette parties where things get out of control and we murder someone, and then we all have to take a blood oath to never reveal our secret?"
April Ludgate,Lovely to meet you.
April Ludgate,I think we're done here.
April Ludgate,"It's got a tennis court, a pool and a three car garage."
April Ludgate,"And it's only 20,000 dollars a month."
April Ludgate,"So Jerry is, like, basically my boss now, which I'm never gonna work for him."
April Ludgate,"Well, I don't want to come back."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Why are you here?
April Ludgate,Boom.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Now?
April Ludgate,"Actually, there are a couple of cool places in here."
April Ludgate,That band is really blowing up right now.
April Ludgate,You.
April Ludgate,It's my office now.
April Ludgate,I don't know what you are talking about.
April Ludgate,And it's in Chicago.
April Ludgate,I don't!
April Ludgate,You're short.
April Ludgate,So do you.
April Ludgate,Burly took them all when he left.
April Ludgate,Excuse me?
April Ludgate,What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast?
April Ludgate,Yo.
April Ludgate,I'll make sure you don't have to go to any meetings.
April Ludgate,"If anyone comes to see you, I'll scare them away."
April Ludgate,I think it's a slam dunk idea.
April Ludgate,"Ron, someone's coming in."
April Ludgate,"So, like, a person?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that'd be fun."
April Ludgate,I'll help you.
April Ludgate,You should.
April Ludgate,Oh.
April Ludgate,Is Mouse Rat gonna break up?
April Ludgate,Is that Justin's coat?
April Ludgate,I just figured I might as well get paid for being here.
April Ludgate,"Anything for you, Jerry."
April Ludgate,"Honestly, you could loosen up a bit on the font stuff. And everything in general."
April Ludgate,Your funeral.
April Ludgate,"Okay, stop."
April Ludgate,"You guys, stop!"
April Ludgate,Stop!
April Ludgate,"We don't have any dishes, okay?"
April Ludgate,"God, that was hot nonsense."
April Ludgate,"Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!"
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Then I might have to leave early.
April Ludgate,Please.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,It's terrible.
April Ludgate,"And I'm going to tell my Daddy you were mean to me, Bert Macklin."
April Ludgate,You're presenting this to Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate,"Don't talk about any of your old, failed businesses, get rid of that stupid light show, and definitely don't use any weird, madeup words that Ron doesn't understand."
April Ludgate,"Well, if you do any of that, he's not gonna invest, so"
April Ludgate,"Ron's trapped in this weird desk prison, and I now work at this traveling IV station."
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,The end.
April Ludgate,Goody.
April Ludgate,"You're too good, Macklin."
April Ludgate,"Thank you, Leslie."
April Ludgate,I love him.
April Ludgate,In here.
April Ludgate,This lady's here.
April Ludgate,"And I'm gonna divorce him, probably right now."
April Ludgate,"Um, you also work there."
April Ludgate,Andy sucks at driving a boat.
April Ludgate,Dead.
April Ludgate,A puppy is here!
April Ludgate,"When Andy proposed to me, he gave me a ring pop, but then he ate it first."
April Ludgate,Yes!
April Ludgate,How did Ben do it?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I'm Janet Snakehole.
April Ludgate,Ah!
April Ludgate,"Gee, golly."
April Ludgate,We did.
April Ludgate,Drinking wine--
April Ludgate,We really want you to be the guest of honor.
April Ludgate,"It does, and we're gonna have this party tomorrow night at The Bulge, and we had something to ask you."
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,And I live nearby.
April Ludgate,"So, we could, like, carpool to work or something."
April Ludgate,"Thanks, mister."
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"I will show you where it is, damn it."
April Ludgate,"So, how much is this one again?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you have to come."
April Ludgate,I'm a very rich widow with a terrible secret.
April Ludgate,Did you get that out of my purse?
April Ludgate,Whoa! Documents.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Does that work, sir?"
April Ludgate,Looks like the only other day he has open is Marchtember One Teenth.
April Ludgate,Do you think you could come back today at 2:65? He's available then.
April Ludgate,I recognized you the day we met.
April Ludgate,My mom has all your albums.
April Ludgate,"Bye, Duke Silver."
April Ludgate,"They just really wanted to meet you, because you're kind of like their hero now."
April Ludgate,"Gee, thanks Ron."
April Ludgate,That's racist.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Ben, you're fired."
April Ludgate,This is awesome.
April Ludgate,I'll just forge it.
April Ludgate,I wanna work up here with you guys.
April Ludgate,I forge government documents all the time.
April Ludgate,"Fine, I'll come back."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,We got it.
April Ludgate,Good girl.
April Ludgate,"Sorry, he's busy right now."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,How about June 50th?
April Ludgate,Tell me what Ann did wrong. Please. I need to know.
April Ludgate,Cake and fish.
April Ludgate,Fish and pop.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"The usual, cake and pop?"
April Ludgate,I'm doing a little experiment tonight to see what will get me drunker.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"Ooh, found the marriage licenses."
April Ludgate,And I am going to take all of them.
April Ludgate,"I don't want anyone else in this town to get married, because it makes it less special for us."
April Ludgate,We're gonna have sex.
April Ludgate,"Hey, we're on our honeymoon."
April Ludgate,Hmm.
April Ludgate,Sure.
April Ludgate,What did he say?
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,And that guy wasn't even a doctor.
April Ludgate,What's going on?
April Ludgate,That sounds really cool.
April Ludgate,"Whoa, you guys should get married."
April Ludgate,"Fine, none of you."
April Ludgate,"Fine, then I'll make out with Ben."
April Ludgate,You know what? We're breaking up.
April Ludgate,"God, why does everything we do have to be cloaked in, like, 15 layers of irony?"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"Hey, we're almost done, so we can leave soon."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Shh.
April Ludgate,Hmm? Mmm.
April Ludgate,Mmm.
April Ludgate,Kicking Ron's butt at Scrabble.
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,"I just played ""lexicons"" for a billion points."
April Ludgate,Babe.
April Ludgate,We are.
April Ludgate,You sound really strong.
April Ludgate,You sound cool.
April Ludgate,Ron's not here.
April Ludgate,"So, marry her then."
April Ludgate,"Andy recently diagnosed himself with what he calls ""shoeshine head."""
April Ludgate,It's when you shine too many shoes and the fumes create a thunderstorm in your brain.
April Ludgate,You know what? Almost everything you wrote on that board as a dream job was some type of police officer.
April Ludgate,"Cures include coffee, cheeseburgers and napping on the floor."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I'll let you know when he's available.
April Ludgate,"How does this sound? ""Officer Dwyer, Pawnee PD."""
April Ludgate,We need you to sign this.
April Ludgate,"No, listen to me."
April Ludgate,It's a marriage license.
April Ludgate,Go Mouse Rat.
April Ludgate,Mmm.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I'm really glad you're here.
April Ludgate,Photoshop.
April Ludgate,I quit.
April Ludgate,It's with me and it's right now and it's about me quitting.
April Ludgate,Why do you care?
April Ludgate,"Well, frankly, you should have thought of that before we burned it."
April Ludgate,"I think you're awesome, and I love you."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,There's one more.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"We got 80 signatures and, like, 30 complaints of excessive rudeness, but who cares?"
April Ludgate,Did you hear me?
April Ludgate,Pawnee doesn't have a health food store.
April Ludgate,Celebrating.
April Ludgate,It's a good one.
April Ludgate,Are you coming to my party?
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Remember my boyfriend Derek, and his boyfriend Ben?"
April Ludgate,He's amazing.
April Ludgate,Now everything we eat is shaped like a dinosaur.
April Ludgate,There's no place for that in a professional office setting.
April Ludgate,It was amazing.
April Ludgate,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, you are so sad."
April Ludgate,Papyrus?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, people. Consistent font usage, come on."
April Ludgate,"Last year, I saw three Jonas Brothers make out with three Robert Pattinsons."
April Ludgate,Do you know how much fun gay Halloween parties are?
April Ludgate,I passed up a gay Halloween party to be here.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, so can we adopt you as our grandma?"
April Ludgate,We have someone who wants to see you!
April Ludgate,"Dude, you're totally blowing this."
April Ludgate,You're not.
April Ludgate,Looked at.
April Ludgate,Is this a nightmare?
April Ludgate,"April, wake up."
April Ludgate,Can I read your mail?
April Ludgate,You're funny.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,That's awesome.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, congratulations."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,"I'm really proud of you, babe."
April Ludgate,Don't let Tom make a copy.
April Ludgate,It says Ronald Swanson.
April Ludgate,"""The IOW is proud to announce this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award Winner, Ronald Swanson."""
April Ludgate,Jerry!
April Ludgate,You're so funny.
April Ludgate,You jerk.
April Ludgate,Now put your used plate in my purse.
April Ludgate,"You're Pawnee's Woman of the Year, it looks like."
April Ludgate,I almost have a complete set.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,"Start drooling, fatties""?"
April Ludgate,Cholesterol tests.
April Ludgate,You gave Tom all your money?
April Ludgate,You did something wrong?
April Ludgate,Don't you work at Lady Foot Locker?
April Ludgate,Nah.
April Ludgate,I kind of feel like it would have been good for you to have your own place.
April Ludgate,It sounded like his name was Forp.
April Ludgate,"I actually think you look really good, except for the stick up your butt."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,I couldn't really hear him.
April Ludgate,I read the magazines and give the rest to Andy.
April Ludgate,Let's put chewed up gum in his pockets.
April Ludgate,I'll do it when you're not in the room then.
April Ludgate,"""Future home of Paunch Burger."
April Ludgate,Xrayed.
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,You got soup all over our mail!
April Ludgate,"My name is Judy Hitler, and I am the spoiled only daughter of Adolf."
April Ludgate,Yay!
April Ludgate,"Yo, police!"
April Ludgate,What is the criminal code for arson?
April Ludgate,So April?
April Ludgate,Where are you going?
April Ludgate,I only ever bring you coffee.
April Ludgate,Ann's not totally hideous.
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,Or we can buy a Wii.
April Ludgate,"Hey, why don't you forget about the donation and just come down here and meet me in person."
April Ludgate,"Okay, what does it mean when an officer calls in a 3542?"
April Ludgate,What's his name?
April Ludgate,"Jerry, you have to schedule an appointment."
April Ludgate,Their burgers will kill you!
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,"Babe, look at me."
April Ludgate,"You are going to pass this test, and you are going to become a cop."
April Ludgate,"And if you don't, I'll just divorce you and marry someone else and then cheat on them with you."
April Ludgate,Jerry!
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I don't like Ann.
April Ludgate,Why does she need our help?
April Ludgate,What's it called?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,You look like a freak.
April Ludgate,"I said, ""I dig your groovy tunes, man."""
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, why don't you date him?"
April Ludgate,"Ugh, why is it always about you, Ann?"
April Ludgate,"I found a dead rabbit on the side of the road, and I cut its feet off and made it into a lucky charm."
April Ludgate,Self centered much?
April Ludgate,"Also, I got you a lucky charm."
April Ludgate,They're full of wasps!
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"""Can you please do mine and send it back to me?"""
April Ludgate,"Yeah, hi."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Not everything is about you.
April Ludgate,"This is about people who are moving, Garry."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I can't think.
April Ludgate,Do you need a ride to the hospital?
April Ludgate,"But I rode my bike here, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon."
April Ludgate,It's possible to have two things.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Miranda.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,Do you have syphilis?
April Ludgate,"I'll help you, John Cena."
April Ludgate,Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?
April Ludgate,These braids you did are making my brain hurt.
April Ludgate,That's the point.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,I just wanted to see if you could tell.
April Ludgate,"Fine, whatever, I'll help you."
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah, you completely disgraced yourself and destroyed an entire town."
April Ludgate,You're basically running the town anyway.
April Ludgate,"So, why don't you just appoint yourself?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I'm so sorry.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I was too busy not wanting to talk to you.
April Ludgate,I'll do it.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,I'm leaving.
April Ludgate,"My husband's kept me in the finest clothes from Bergdorf Goodman, you see."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Why are you guys talking like that?
April Ludgate,"Jerry, what are you doing?"
April Ludgate,"Well, that was a very good Being Nice To Someone."
April Ludgate,Look.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,He was my husband.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you can do better."
April Ludgate,Donna!
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I'm pregnant with Josh Groban's baby.
April Ludgate,That was good.
April Ludgate,That man wasn't my brother.
April Ludgate,Please leave.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"So, after reviewing all the options, I found that the best location for the dog park is Lot 48, the one behind Ann's house."
April Ludgate,But you have to give me a reason to spit.
April Ludgate,This is weird.
April Ludgate,To spit! You asked me aâ¦
April Ludgate,Don't ask me a question.
April Ludgate,Let him go.
April Ludgate,Do you live here?
April Ludgate,"It's... Every week this show is an amazing train wreck, and you love doing it, and you're the best host."
April Ludgate,"Like, even better than my all-time favorite host, Tom Snyder, which is crazy."
April Ludgate,That's what people always say when something sucks.
April Ludgate,I am all over it.
April Ludgate,Blindness?
April Ludgate,AIDS?
April Ludgate,"No, this is publicity for Orin's new performance art show."
April Ludgate,He's an animal living on a human farm.
April Ludgate,And you can go and feed him from your own hand.
April Ludgate,"I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I thought so."
April Ludgate,Shh!
April Ludgate,Catch.
April Ludgate,Do you live here?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,And I can't be the person that makes you lose what you love.
April Ludgate,"And all those kids love you, and you're doing what you're meant to do."
April Ludgate,Okay?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it is."
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,And you guys aren't being funny.
April Ludgate,Get over it.
April Ludgate,"Buzz Aldrin, nice to meet you."
April Ludgate,I was the second person to walk on the moon.
April Ludgate,I've already been to space.
April Ludgate,Derek!
April Ludgate,"And since you work in a hospital, as a janitor"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I can't believe you came."
April Ludgate,I was wondering if maybe you would write one for me?
April Ludgate,"Babe, they're all gone."
April Ludgate,They're all gone.
April Ludgate,Because you hooked up with him?
April Ludgate,"In our bed, I guess."
April Ludgate,So I have to be your slave or something?
April Ludgate,"No, that is so much worse."
April Ludgate,"God, he's actually losing money."
April Ludgate,"Hey, smart ass, we can't afford it."
April Ludgate,So I really need a letter of recommendation.
April Ludgate,I'm thinking about applying to veterinary school in Bloomington.
April Ludgate,I still might not.
April Ludgate,You really think that's gonna motivate people
April Ludgate,"Fine, forget it."
April Ludgate,Of the universe.
April Ludgate,"Actually, you should be President."
April Ludgate,You'd be an amazing mayor.
April Ludgate,The Internet.
April Ludgate,You should totally do it.
April Ludgate,"I've been everywhere, darling."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, where's your penis?"
April Ludgate,"And, honestly, I've asked you to listen to them, like, a million times, and you never have, so"
April Ludgate,That band is really important to me.
April Ludgate,I have to tell you a secret.
April Ludgate,"But if you tell anyone, I will kill you slowly with a giant syringe."
April Ludgate,"Yes, Ann, I want pancakes."
April Ludgate,I'm a very wealthy woman.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
April Ludgate,This question is gross.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"Must eat babies for fuel."""
April Ludgate,Stop.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like, ""One, one, zero, one."
April Ludgate,He's a robot.
April Ludgate,Don't question his methods.
April Ludgate,"No, sir."
April Ludgate,Gross.
April Ludgate,Because Andy's not feeling well.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse?"
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse or did they fire you because you slept with all the doctors?"
April Ludgate,"This morning he got in, sat down in there, and has been staring straight ahead, doing nothing."
April Ludgate,"Um Yao Ming's torso, Napoleon's brain, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame's hunchback."
April Ludgate,Do you like my nails?
April Ludgate,"You know, for a gay couple, you guys are being really gay."
April Ludgate,All systems are operational.
April Ludgate,"He's a gorgeous genius, people."
April Ludgate,"Pawnee only has two dog parks this one and that one, which is also an active parking lot."
April Ludgate,It's Leslie Knope.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he was hanging up his gold record."
April Ludgate,"I was supposed to copy all the department files onto a thumb drive, and it kept freezing, and I got annoyed, and I don't know what happened, but all the files are gone on every computer."
April Ludgate,We only had an hour.
April Ludgate,Maybe.
April Ludgate,I'm kind of busy.
April Ludgate,I can't.
April Ludgate,Under the table.
April Ludgate,Polo!
April Ludgate,Polo!
April Ludgate,Polo!
April Ludgate,"Washington, D.C."
April Ludgate,Polo!
April Ludgate,has more dog parks per capita than most cities.
April Ludgate,I'm not hungry.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Why is it weird?
April Ludgate,"Okay, but to be fair, you never know."
April Ludgate,Shave your head.
April Ludgate,It was personal.
April Ludgate,Have sex with Jerry.
April Ludgate,Are you going to shove it up your butt?
April Ludgate,And what exactly do you plan on doing with this game show idea?
April Ludgate,I would never make a workrelated call.
April Ludgate,Saw off your pinky toe.
April Ludgate,"Well, I tried to be reasonable."
April Ludgate,You know that.
April Ludgate,Secrets stolen from deep inside.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I guess he wore me down.
April Ludgate,"You know, he asked me out so many times."
April Ludgate,"Pawnee Zoo, monkey speaking."
April Ludgate,That's so cute.
April Ludgate,"Hello, is this Mrs."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,And I'm definitely bringing it up at the next city council meeting.
April Ludgate,"Like, order you something?"
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Yeah?
April Ludgate,I didn't kill anybody!
April Ludgate,And I didn't burn down the mill either.
April Ludgate,My sister did.
April Ludgate,I was just talking on the phone.
April Ludgate,I swear on this dead crow that I will never cook for you.
April Ludgate,Hard work never pays off.
April Ludgate,"Tell me about Chris, or I'm leaving, and I don't care about the letter."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,Warm and happy.
April Ludgate,It looks warm in there!
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry, but lot 48 is the only one that works."
April Ludgate,But now she's been eaten by wolves!
April Ludgate,Yeah?
April Ludgate,Gallivan?
April Ludgate,Of course I do.
April Ludgate,That was a really good Ron.
April Ludgate,"All I know is that I just want to live in a world that's a better place, and your contribution will definitely help us get there, to the Better place world, Fred."
April Ludgate,And Ben and Chris.
April Ludgate,Twout! Twout! Twout! Twout!
April Ludgate,Yay!
April Ludgate,"Yeah, maybe."
April Ludgate,We should just directly apply the food to your clothes.
April Ludgate,I'll take something basic like a beer.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna go.
April Ludgate,"No problem, lady!"
April Ludgate,"Hey, I brought you a coffee, help you get through the day."
April Ludgate,He's actually kind of awesome.
April Ludgate,Never.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"She's Leslie Knope, and she wants to recruit you!"
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,"Well, gee, I don't know, Fred."
April Ludgate,I got you a peppermint latte.
April Ludgate,"Well, my name is April, and wouldn't you know it, I'm raising money for a city council candidate I believe in."
April Ludgate,"No, mira, mira, mira, mira, mira."
April Ludgate,Everyone knows this song.
April Ludgate,It's amazing.
April Ludgate,"It's, like, whatever you want."
April Ludgate,The drum beats out of time
April Ludgate,"Like, 10 dollars."
April Ludgate,It don't matter.
April Ludgate,"Well, I reckon it's just like grammy Martha told me and my cousins, ""you can't eat the biscuits if you don't pay for the flour."
April Ludgate,She's kind of right.
April Ludgate,"None of his family lives here, and all of his friends are frat guys and morons."
April Ludgate,"Bye, kids."
April Ludgate,"Known locally to Venezuelans as ""The Devil's Fist."""
April Ludgate,A Goliath birdeating tarantula.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Jerry."
April Ludgate,Is this some kind of weird power trip?
April Ludgate,"Okay, ready?"
April Ludgate,"I need a place to deliver this baby, Ann."
April Ludgate,I'm pregnant.
April Ludgate,I wonder what they're doing right now.
April Ludgate,Do those come in different sizes?
April Ludgate,"You know, if I gave you a hickey, it would totally make Ann jealous."
April Ludgate,I'm gonna need about 40 dozen of those.
April Ludgate,"Also, what about your neon gangster fedora hats?"
April Ludgate,It's tiny and awful and loud.
April Ludgate,"Oh, by the way I'm calling from inside your house."
April Ludgate,What the hell is he doing?
April Ludgate,"And it's zone 14B, industrial waste cleanup site."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's not."
April Ludgate,I gave my gay boyfriend's boyfriend a hickey and it totally made my gay boyfriend jealous.
April Ludgate,We should technically be wearing Hazmat suits right now.
April Ludgate,Ben!
April Ludgate,That was rude.
April Ludgate,What's weird about one friend sucking on another friend's neck?
April Ludgate,"Hey, we're still gonna assassinate him, right?"
April Ludgate,"Fine, if you don't wanna donate, then don't."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"No, anything you can say to Ann, you can say to me because we're best friends this week."
April Ludgate,"Yes, hi."
April Ludgate,I have a question about your inflatable saxophones.
April Ludgate,"Shut up, Glenn."
April Ludgate,Why don't you talk now?
April Ludgate,"Chris, we can talk now."
April Ludgate,It's my birthday party.
April Ludgate,"What's going on, best friend?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,Leave me alone!
April Ludgate,"It's because of your man strength, Man Perkins."
April Ludgate,"Sorry, Dad."
April Ludgate,Ow.
April Ludgate,Tell me.
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,"I've told you that, like, a thousand times."
April Ludgate,That's my favorite band.
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Don't be afraid.
April Ludgate,The guy from Neutral Milk Hotel.
April Ludgate,Use the penises.
April Ludgate,DJ Roomba.
April Ludgate,Score.
April Ludgate,It's making Champion sad.
April Ludgate,"No, don't make out."
April Ludgate,Ow!
April Ludgate,Shut up.
April Ludgate,"Aw, forget it, I'm coming in."
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
April Ludgate,Get off me.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,"You guys, the penis hats cut your digging time in half."
April Ludgate,You're not technically a rock star.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"That's right, you could practically cook an egg on the sidewalk."
April Ludgate,"And I am April Blart, mall cop."
April Ludgate,"Wow, there he is, Barack Obama."
April Ludgate,For you to tell me what's going on with Chris?
April Ludgate,Stay tuned.
April Ludgate,"Uh, when we come back, we will take a look at the journey of Andy Dwyer."
April Ludgate,"You leave that to us, Johnny."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, bad call, Bert."
April Ludgate,"I don't care about that prize, but I'm gonna win because I want his happiness to go away."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Johnny, you have made so many kids and so many parents so happy that we wanted to give you a proper sendoff."
April Ludgate,That is right.
April Ludgate,"No, tell me about Chris."
April Ludgate,It's coming out of me right now.
April Ludgate,"Thank you, alcohol."
April Ludgate,I guess I kind of hate most things.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"And now, your lives are perfect."
April Ludgate,"No, please don't, okay? He's gonna be pissed at me."
April Ludgate,"You had sex one time and you had three kids and they're all, like, smart and great and healthy."
April Ludgate,Because you guys got so lucky.
April Ludgate,You know why it's so unfair?
April Ludgate,"Blah, blah, blah and barf."
April Ludgate,But our life is pretty perfect already.
April Ludgate,"""And yes, they drive you nuts, but it's all worth it for the beauty and the majesty and the glory of their little faces in the morning."""
April Ludgate,"I just-- I don't want him to be mad at me, okay?"
April Ludgate,"""They change your life."""
April Ludgate,"You're going to be like, ""They're so great."""
April Ludgate,You're going to lecture me about how Andy and I should have kids.
April Ludgate,"All right, go ahead."
April Ludgate,You think so?
April Ludgate,"I already ruined his big day, and it's my fault that it's in Ann's house, who he's obviously still in love with."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"This is my boyfriend, Derek, and this is Derek's boyfriend, Ben."
April Ludgate,Ew.
April Ludgate,I know!
April Ludgate,I want it on.
April Ludgate,What do you mean?
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,What if it laid eggs in the bed?
April Ludgate,And you know what?
April Ludgate,"So, you think we should?"
April Ludgate,Please tell me what to do.
April Ludgate,I just don't know what to do.
April Ludgate,I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,"But Andy and I are cool already, so our kids will be, like, really lame and weird."
April Ludgate,That's why your kids are so cool.
April Ludgate,Kids act the opposite of their parents.
April Ludgate,What do I do?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God! Stop!"
April Ludgate,I'm just trying to be nice.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna put him down as a yes.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I would love all the awesome stuff my body would go through."
April Ludgate,"Andy, you know where I stand on this."
April Ludgate,Jerry Filter!
April Ludgate,I'm going to call a cab.
April Ludgate,He runs weird.
April Ludgate,Did you?
April Ludgate,"I mean, if all it meant was puking and getting weird stretch marks and veins everywhere, then sign me up."
April Ludgate,Did you eat all the candy?
April Ludgate,Just put all the candy in a bowl or something.
April Ludgate,"My love, we have to go."
April Ludgate,Sorry.
April Ludgate,Aw.
April Ludgate,Sure.
April Ludgate,"Okay, bye."
April Ludgate,What's wrong?
April Ludgate,There's three years of nice messages on here.
April Ludgate,"But at the end, we've brought a child into the world?"
April Ludgate,That's disgusting.
April Ludgate,There you go.
April Ludgate,That's right.
April Ludgate,"So, it's relevant."
April Ludgate,"""'I wouldn't have been able to do it without an early-morning caffeine boost from the amazing April Ludgate."""
April Ludgate,"""She gave me the liquid courage I needed to wrestle that beast to the ground."""
April Ludgate,Who's Sandra Dee?
April Ludgate,What are you guys dressed as?
April Ludgate,Ambulances are dumb.
April Ludgate,When has an ambulance ever helped anyone?
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,Let's go.
April Ludgate,We're going to be late for dinner.
April Ludgate,Jerry.
April Ludgate,I'm rooting for you kids.
April Ludgate,"""Congratulations on your wedding."""
April Ludgate,"Derek is gay, but he's straight for me, but he's gay for Ben, and Ben's really gay for Derek."
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,That's the whole point.
April Ludgate,"I was getting kind of sick of listening to Tom and Ann talk about their relationship, but then I remembered that alcohol existed."
April Ludgate,Do you know them?
April Ludgate,"""Also, you are way better at laundry."""
April Ludgate,"""April, here's something to help you remember our three legged dog champion."""
April Ludgate,Thank you and you're welcome.
April Ludgate,Come back here.
April Ludgate,I heard he makes mature women swoon when he plays.
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,"Most of all me, April Ludgate, the real hero."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,That's vandalism.
April Ludgate,"So tomorrow, I lead a public forum in Leslie's Fleetwood Mac sex pants."
April Ludgate,But I was the best.
April Ludgate,But especially me!
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I've heard of him.
April Ludgate,"A ticket stub from a Fleetwood Mac concert in 1995, and"
April Ludgate,"You got it, Duke."
April Ludgate,"""Rah rah rah!"""
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,This is boring.
April Ludgate,We got to go back to the garbage.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Andy found it, and he's gonna tell you about it right now."
April Ludgate,"Go, babe."
April Ludgate,"""Down with the Sewage Department!"""
April Ludgate,Whoa.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I can do it."
April Ludgate,God.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Who cares?
April Ludgate,That's my husband.
April Ludgate,"Whatever happened to, ""We're the Parks Department!"""
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Tom! It's April, I'm at Ann's house and the possum's loose! Okay? I need your help!"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God! It's chewing on everything! Don't tell Leslie."
April Ludgate,"What's in the pocket, you ask?"
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, and then I opened all the doors because I thought it would just go outside, but it won't leave the house! It must love tacky pictures of flowers."
April Ludgate,Uh-oh.
April Ludgate,How about Demon Spawn Baby Satan Dwyer?
April Ludgate,"Mmm, we need a Halloween angle."
April Ludgate,Where is it?
April Ludgate,"He did that, too."
April Ludgate,Let's do this.
April Ludgate,She's a monster.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, then break up with her."
April Ludgate,I can't see it!
April Ludgate,I don't know! I don't know.
April Ludgate,"Wait, no, babe, my birth mix."
April Ludgate,Then don't break up with her.
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm ready."
April Ludgate,And I hate Ben.
April Ludgate,"Come on, Jerry."
April Ludgate,"I let it out of its cage because it needed water, and I thought it would just drink out of the toilet or something, but then it ran off and I couldn't get it back in."
April Ludgate,You can't remove it.
April Ludgate,She had the patch sewn in.
April Ludgate,She still wears this.
April Ludgate,"So, to get through it, I figured I'm just gonna basically try to imitate Leslie."
April Ludgate,"I have to lead a public forum for the Pawnee Commons every day this week, and I hate talking to people."
April Ludgate,Andy and Lesile sent us care packages.
April Ludgate,"Oh my God, is that you as a naked horse."
April Ludgate,How would I know?
April Ludgate,"I don't know who Ann Taylor is, but I hate her and I want to kill her."
April Ludgate,This suit makes me want to scold a Catholic child.
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,So would I.
April Ludgate,"Okay, Leslie Knope outfit number eight."
April Ludgate,Jack.
April Ludgate,"Stop ringing the doorbell, it's making him mad."
April Ludgate,I put the makeup on after I went into labor.
April Ludgate,You animal!
April Ludgate,"Make love to me, you fool!"
April Ludgate,"Damn it, Macklin, I love it when you take charge."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"And if they answer, can you just read those numbers out loud?"
April Ludgate,I sat behind you in middle school band.
April Ludgate,You can't keep it all bottled up.
April Ludgate,Do you still play the clarinet?
April Ludgate,"How have you been, man?"
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"Oh, I don't know, Jerry."
April Ludgate,He can't even get karma right.
April Ludgate,It's like touching raw chicken.
April Ludgate,"I wasn't listening to anything you just said, but who is gonna be the mayor for the next two months then?"
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,"Okay, thanks."
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,"This lesbian nurse is right, Chris."
April Ludgate,"I've been on hold for, like, an hour and I really have to pee."
April Ludgate,Did you finish the maintenance report?
April Ludgate,I could get fired.
April Ludgate,What if she doesn't?
April Ludgate,"Okay, let me hear your favorite one so far."
April Ludgate,"Maybe try to do one without the word ""dead"" so much."
April Ludgate,"Or ""death"" or ""you're dead."""
April Ludgate,"Can you just sit here for two seconds and just listen, please?"
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,We didn't mug Jerry.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,That's how pathetic Jerry is.
April Ludgate,"Can you come here, please?"
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,"So, when you say that you want me to check in with the police liaison, you mean hook up with him, right?"
April Ludgate,"It's Sunday night, I'm making phone calls to strangers, and you're in my house."
April Ludgate,It's okay.
April Ludgate,Maybe a deer will eat him.
April Ludgate,Is that cool?
April Ludgate,"So, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you."
April Ludgate,But I never really seem to hate you.
April Ludgate,Being nice made me feel terrible.
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,You look Enrique Iglesias.
April Ludgate,"And if you became Mayor of Pawnee, you could put it behind you, once and for all."
April Ludgate,"Plus, this would erase Ice Town."
April Ludgate,You're the best person for the job and you deserve it.
April Ludgate,You should be mayor.
April Ludgate,Right?
April Ludgate,"You know that I despise you, and that I want you and all people on Earth to be miserable."
April Ludgate,Ben.
April Ludgate,It's been torturing you since you were 18 years old.
April Ludgate,"No, Ann's there."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,I was never here.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,My life couldn't be worse.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Arm wrestle me right now.
April Ludgate,Andy.
April Ludgate,Aah!
April Ludgate,Why do you care about him?
April Ludgate,Nice.
April Ludgate,"If I come down there, can I at least break something?"
April Ludgate,You think I haven't been around the world?
April Ludgate,There's not much more to discuss.
April Ludgate,Hunting trip.
April Ludgate,You kind of explained it all.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,"Hey, your stupid Know Your Boo game made me and Andy get in a big fight."
April Ludgate,"He just sold his guitar, and he's, like, quitting music now."
April Ludgate,"We have a couple of house rules, though."
April Ludgate,Is that code for some kind of weird sex act?
April Ludgate,Picking out a dumb charity is the most excited he's been in weeks.
April Ludgate,You're so selfish.
April Ludgate,"Oh, it's all about what you're doing, isn't it?"
April Ludgate,Classic Ben!
April Ludgate,"Okay, I feel like it's time for me to get out of here."
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,"Ever since Andy failed the police exam, he's been really depressed."
April Ludgate,Leslie!
April Ludgate,Donna is going to take some of the money you usually use on your trips and establish an education program through the foundation I work for.
April Ludgate,"Oh, no!"
April Ludgate,You want me to dial a number and then read another number out loud?
April Ludgate,What's wrong with you?
April Ludgate,"Yo, you ready to go?"
April Ludgate,That happened.
April Ludgate,"Wow, thanks for nothing, Dr. Harris"
April Ludgate,They got you!
April Ludgate,One last journey to the weirdest place on earth?
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Some thieves are trying to steal the legendary Snakehole Sapphire.
April Ludgate,And it's his last wish that I have this meeting with you.
April Ludgate,"Agent Macklin, I need you."
April Ludgate,Mmm.
April Ludgate,What about Andy's music thing?
April Ludgate,"The disturbing murals, the ominous lighting, the creepy people."
April Ludgate,"Of all the places in Pawnee, I'm going to miss the fourth floor the most."
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,"I'm his daughter, April Swanson."
April Ludgate,I'm afraid that Ron Swanson's currently dead.
April Ludgate,He called it.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna go.
April Ludgate,Wonderful.
April Ludgate,"Hey, uh, batteries I mean, human food sounds good to me."
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah."
April Ludgate,Andy.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Hey, what do you want?"
April Ludgate,"If you ever speak to me in Spanish, please use the formal ""usted""."
April Ludgate,"Ooh, you know what would make it more fun?"
April Ludgate,No personal phone conversations.
April Ludgate,"Okay, can I just come out there, so we can talk about everything?"
April Ludgate,You have to climb in through the back window.
April Ludgate,You can't use the front door.
April Ludgate,And no electricity after 6:00 p.m.
April Ludgate,"Why can't we just quickly shake hands, pretend we liked each other, and get out of here?"
April Ludgate,I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
April Ludgate,Horses don't fly.
April Ludgate,Yo.
April Ludgate,Is your name Glenn?
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,"Or even worse, Leslie might give me a lecture on responsibility again, I can't do it."
April Ludgate,You ready?
April Ludgate,Are you the kind of doctor who gets hooked on his own drugs?
April Ludgate,I bet you are.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he sneezed and smacked his head against the wall."
April Ludgate,Not me.
April Ludgate,You want my gum?
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,There she is.
April Ludgate,Yep.
April Ludgate,I thought Freddy Spaghetti OD'd.
April Ludgate,"There's no noise allowed on Mondays, and no TV after breakfast."
April Ludgate,Oh.
April Ludgate,"If you ever watch a sad movie, you have to wear mascara so we can see whether or not you've been crying."
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Couple more rules.
April Ludgate,"""Oh, sorry, guys."""
April Ludgate,"""Sorry I'm late."""
April Ludgate,"""I got confused and took a shower, after I got dressed, because I'm Jerry."""
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, this."
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,You do?
April Ludgate,"It's just, I've been on this weird path my entire adult life, and I need to figure out what I really want."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"I broke the box, and I threw away all the votes, and I voted for you a thousand times."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you saw a lot of potential in me, I'm like a daughter to you, and it was a treat to watch me blossom."
April Ludgate,"Blah blah blah, bye."
April Ludgate,Attention: Eagleton is now under martial law.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"It takes, like, eight hours to cook something in this thing."
April Ludgate,"You should get on up there, King Dwyer."
April Ludgate,Women's studies.
April Ludgate,"Andy, we're planning our whole week, like old people!"
April Ludgate,We used to be spontaneous and weird.
April Ludgate,We used to eat cereal out of Frisbees because we didn't have any bowls.
April Ludgate,You once broke a rib trying to wrestle one of those inflatable floppy guys at a car dealership.
April Ludgate,Now you sprained your shoulder trying to clean out the stupid gutter.
April Ludgate,You even have a job.
April Ludgate,I guess I could pick up a brisket tomorrow and start it for dinner Thursday.
April Ludgate,Larry?
April Ludgate,"Dark forces, arise!"
April Ludgate,Eww stop.
April Ludgate,"Tom, can you please help me?"
April Ludgate,I'm filling in for a person who smiles 90% of the time.
April Ludgate,I hate doing Leslie's job.
April Ludgate,The spell's broken.
April Ludgate,"Okay, gross."
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,"He's 33, and I'm 47/immortal."
April Ludgate,It's probably that.
April Ludgate,Or he's secretly super in love with me.
April Ludgate,"Also, if Chris puts that much effort into making my stupid night better, I'm sure that he'll make your lame life perfect."
April Ludgate,"I miss Andy, and it's making me weak."
April Ludgate,I'm weak.
April Ludgate,You guys are cute.
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry I said you were lame, okay? You are, but I know you were just trying to help me, so"
April Ludgate,I'm just so scared that this means that Ann won't really leave.
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,We have a bank account!
April Ludgate,His name is Larry Gengurch.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,We like it here.
April Ludgate,"I made Andy promise that someday we'll move to Transylvania, but that probably won't happen till we're, like, 100."
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,I love you too.
April Ludgate,I love you too.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Please don't make me say it.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Stop taunting me.
April Ludgate,He's a genius.
April Ludgate,"Okay, Leslie's coming back."
April Ludgate,"Get off me, wench!"
April Ludgate,Come here.
April Ludgate,Please.
April Ludgate,"Your name is Larry, Larry Gengurch."
April Ludgate,Maybe they'll eat your toes.
April Ludgate,You're all set.
April Ludgate,I promise.
April Ludgate,I'll have fun.
April Ludgate,Let's stay.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"If we went to high school together, we would have never started dating, which means that we would have never gotten married, and I don't like thinking about that."
April Ludgate,"Because this prom reminds me that you had, like, a million friends in high school and everyone thought you were awesome, and I spent four years making fun of everyone and hiding mops so the janitor would think he was going insane."
April Ludgate,"Well, Michigan has wolverines."
April Ludgate,I was buried in it.
April Ludgate,"We've held out as long as we could, but it finally happened."
April Ludgate,Is that Chris?
April Ludgate,Haverford.
April Ludgate,"Ha, ha, classic Larry."
April Ludgate,We're boring.
April Ludgate,We're boring people who bore each other by being boring.
April Ludgate,That's it.
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,Or just do it?
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,What do you love doing?
April Ludgate,It'll just screw up the rest of your life.
April Ludgate,"Look, dude, this internship leads nowhere."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Seems like the party's dying down.
April Ludgate,Weird.
April Ludgate,Is everything okay?
April Ludgate,"Ann, you probably wanna head to Michigan forever, so I snuck into your house and packed a bag for you."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,I stole your wallet.
April Ludgate,"Hi, I'm April."
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,So hurry up and get ready.
April Ludgate,The gala starts in an hour.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, what are we gonna have sex on?"
April Ludgate,"Tell Ann about the groundbreaking, frame Ann for murder, release a deadly virus into the water supply."
April Ludgate,What did you wanna be when you were little?
April Ludgate,What's this?
April Ludgate,"Okay, well, let's go set up this party."
April Ludgate,Some kind of lame drug deal?
April Ludgate,Ann's leaving town and saying painful goodbyes to loved ones.
April Ludgate,"April Ludgate, youth outreach and director of new media."
April Ludgate,Greatest day of my life!
April Ludgate,I just wanna hang out with you.
April Ludgate,"We are all out of water, actually."
April Ludgate,"Thanks, Mike."
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,"Go do something fun, like trying to control birds with your mind, or posting Internet comments as Michael Jackson's ghost."
April Ludgate,"But more importantly, don't do this internship."
April Ludgate,"Okay, side note, I'm gonna file papers to adopt you as my child, so keep an eye out for that."
April Ludgate,That's where Champion came from.
April Ludgate,I'll have to use boiling hot milk.
April Ludgate,What did Jerry say?
April Ludgate,"And don't forget, tomorrow we have to go to that guy's office to sign the renters insurance forms."
April Ludgate,Get ready.
April Ludgate,"Ew, if your nose is all weird after this, I'm totally gonna divorce you."
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,Mork?
April Ludgate,That doesn't help me.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"You, what brought you here?"
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,"Talk about why you're here, whether you're throwing your lives away, stuff like that."
April Ludgate,I'm blocking an ambulance.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, there's a picture of you also."
April Ludgate,And two huge security guards.
April Ludgate,We should go.
April Ludgate,That sounds fun.
April Ludgate,"I don't know, weird stuff about waffles."
April Ludgate,"Okay, so, let's get to know each other."
April Ludgate,Gross.
April Ludgate,What about you?
April Ludgate,Why are you here?
April Ludgate,I think that's cool.
April Ludgate,I feel like you have almost zero potential.
April Ludgate,"Let's take a walk, Jen."
April Ludgate,"Jen, is it?"
April Ludgate,Shut up.
April Ludgate,Maybe I should work at a bar.
April Ludgate,What are they like?
April Ludgate,Let's go.
April Ludgate,Then who made you do this?
April Ludgate,Is everything cool?
April Ludgate,What are you studying?
April Ludgate,"Uh, not really."
April Ludgate,"Public works put up a giant padlock on the fence and a sign that says ""No trespassing."""
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,"There's also a sign that says ""Especially Leslie Knope."""
April Ludgate,You're all gonna die in here!
April Ludgate,"Plus, I can get free drinks any time I want."
April Ludgate,"It's too late for me, I've seen too much, but maybe I can save them."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Donna?
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,"God, she's always just leaving and not telling me."
April Ludgate,This slutty nurse is trying to smother me to death with a pillow!
April Ludgate,Let's put stink bombs in all the vents.
April Ludgate,Wait.
April Ludgate,Help!
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Stay back, slut!"
April Ludgate,I got rid of all the stink bombs before I babysat Leslie's kids.
April Ludgate,Totally.
April Ludgate,"Tynny and I have been, like, totally bonding."
April Ludgate,We've just been like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!
April Ludgate,Is this true?
April Ludgate,I forgot.
April Ludgate,"Like, talking, like, so much forever."
April Ludgate,"Well, Donna can help you get started on the paperwork."
April Ludgate,Are you trying to smother me?
April Ludgate,Yay!
April Ludgate,We went to prom.
April Ludgate,"Well, we did it."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"I'll come back, if you guys are being weird."
April Ludgate,I will.
April Ludgate,Awesome.
April Ludgate,"So, like a banana made of spiders?"
April Ludgate,There he is!
April Ludgate,"Ron, how about this guy?"
April Ludgate,"Also, you have a visitor."
April Ludgate,I moved our meetings to tomorrow because you are drunk and hungover simultaneously at 2:00 in the afternoon.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,That was easy.
April Ludgate,I think I know a good dog.
April Ludgate,Let's go now.
April Ludgate,"Babe, the pen."
April Ludgate,You only spent 40 dollars on clothes in the past 5 years?
April Ludgate,"Bye, dad."
April Ludgate,"I know, I'm eating it all up."
April Ludgate,Now I'm sad that I miss Andy and sad that I can't make fun of you to Andy.
April Ludgate,Your lame attempts at trying to cheer me up are not working.
April Ludgate,"Just stop, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Mom, stop embarrassing me."
April Ludgate,"I know, right?"
April Ludgate,What exactly would happen if I said yes?
April Ludgate,I need it.
April Ludgate,He's an FBI agent.
April Ludgate,Bert Macklin is not a lifeguard.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, just take the picture already, mom."
April Ludgate,"And you're never gonna make me not miss Andy, okay?"
April Ludgate,"There's, like, a million mirrors in front of me."
April Ludgate,"Everybody, listen up."
April Ludgate,"No, stop."
April Ludgate,"Just have to work harder, I guess, huh?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'm fine."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Is this land mine still functional?
April Ludgate,Being responsible adults sucks butts.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"So Randy says the House is voting tomorrow, and they need us in Washington to prep."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that sucks."
April Ludgate,Because I want to blow up Donna's desk so I can teach her a lesson about what happens when you skip work.
April Ludgate,What do I do?
April Ludgate,I love it.
April Ludgate,"I don't even know her, but she's my hero."
April Ludgate,I took Ron's advice.
April Ludgate,I very maturely and straightforwardly left anonymous comments about Donna online.
April Ludgate,Uh-huh.
April Ludgate,"I'm kind of her boss, now, but I still feel weird disciplining her."
April Ludgate,Interesting.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I hate teenagers."
April Ludgate,"Um, I work here, so, legally, you can adopt me."
April Ludgate,I think it's kind of cool.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'd love to do a shot."
April Ludgate,I call sitting on your lap.
April Ludgate,'Cause wine makes me sleepy now.
April Ludgate,I dare you to eat this entire jug of olives.
April Ludgate,I'm getting a cluster headache.
April Ludgate,What are you doing?
April Ludgate,You ruined it.
April Ludgate,We have to figure something else out.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you always feel better when you do."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, was your name Jennifer?"
April Ludgate,"Um, well, nice to meet you."
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,"My name's April, and I just wanted to say that your dress is so cute it's bonks."
April Ludgate,I want to be burned at the stake.
April Ludgate,That class was awesome.
April Ludgate,"I started here when I was 20, and now I'm old and gross and directionless."
April Ludgate,I'll do it.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"Whoa, who are you even talking about?"
April Ludgate,Gross.
April Ludgate,"Okay, somebody has got to do something."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Why are you here eating alone?
April Ludgate,Why did you just say those weird things?
April Ludgate,Go away.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Andy, come on."
April Ludgate,Torturing Jerry was my favorite thing in the world.
April Ludgate,After making out with you.
April Ludgate,"I hate us, let's go."
April Ludgate,"What are you doing, weirdo?"
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,I'm over there with people you actually know If you want to come join us.
April Ludgate,"Well, I guess that settles who the new Jerry is."
April Ludgate,"I'm not quite sure, but Tom can answer that if What are you doing?"
April Ludgate,She referred to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride.
April Ludgate,That's impossible.
April Ludgate,I had no idea how terrible Leslie's job is.
April Ludgate,So the new emergency protocol for the Parks department can be found in your binders.
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate and I will be filling in for Leslie while she runs for office.
April Ludgate,"Good morning, everyone!"
April Ludgate,"Um, I'm gonna go to the girls' bathroom to check the trash cans for babies, but you can dance if you want."
April Ludgate,What kind of pet are you interested in adopting?
April Ludgate,"We have dogs, cats, rabbits."
April Ludgate,"You know what, why don't we just say that whoever gets to the emergency first will be in charge?"
April Ludgate,"All due respect, Mr."
April Ludgate,"Whoa, check it out."
April Ludgate,You can get credit for playing intramural frisbee golf.
April Ludgate,Because you look like a hamster penis.
April Ludgate,Alf.
April Ludgate,She has the shingles.
April Ludgate,Prison.
April Ludgate,The Internet.
April Ludgate,How can I love someone when I hate everything he loves?
April Ludgate,"I just want to go home, but I feel bad because Andy's having such a good time."
April Ludgate,Are you sure?
April Ludgate,"hamster penis, but no, I don't."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Who's your spinning instructor?
April Ludgate,Gregory or Wynona?
April Ludgate,Wynona rocks my world.
April Ludgate,She's the worst person I've ever met.
April Ludgate,I want to travel the world with her.
April Ludgate,"Those kids are me 10 years ago, and this internship is the videotape from The Ring."
April Ludgate,I could see you.
April Ludgate,I'm a girl in a sleazy club.
April Ludgate,I hate drinking alone.
April Ludgate,Hello again.
April Ludgate,I'm on it.
April Ludgate,Tiny rolled up scrolls delivered by trained foxes.
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah."
April Ludgate,"As you remember, I'm April, and this is Ann, my 65 year old grandmother."
April Ludgate,This round's on the house!
April Ludgate,We do that every night.
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,I'm Janet.
April Ludgate,My dad owns this place.
April Ludgate,What should we do tonight?
April Ludgate,You're running for office?
April Ludgate,What are you doing?
April Ludgate,Voodoo is still an option.
April Ludgate,Janet Snakehole.
April Ludgate,I'll say it again.
April Ludgate,All right!
April Ludgate,How about some tips?
April Ludgate,I don't mind.
April Ludgate,"Please, I can go."
April Ludgate,Don't.
April Ludgate,"No, that's a super small piano."
April Ludgate,How much?
April Ludgate,Check your testicles?
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,How about 300?
April Ludgate,They'll do it.
April Ludgate,"Come on, it could be the last night on earth."
April Ludgate,Let's do something weird.
April Ludgate,"You guys, Leslie."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,It's better than listening to her stump speech for a millionth time.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Andy can do it.
April Ludgate,"She said the Bline is cool, Meemaw."
April Ludgate,"It's not ideal, but they may go for it because of how bad they screwed up."
April Ludgate,Gryzzl will take half for their campus and then donate the rest to National Parks.
April Ludgate,Our new proposal will ask them to split the land.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Cool means good.
April Ludgate,"Then, I want a janitor."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"They can do what you do, right?"
April Ludgate,It was pointless.
April Ludgate,I'm not going to school here.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'm not going here."
April Ludgate,I don't want to.
April Ludgate,"Well, bye."
April Ludgate,Hire Andy.
April Ludgate,"Babe, I don't think you should play any of those songs for a group of six year olds."
April Ludgate,"Hey, six beers for table 12."
April Ludgate,Yeah
April Ludgate,"Meemaw, God, no one uses the word hip anymore."
April Ludgate,But also militaries are pretty good at protecting countries.
April Ludgate,Sometimes I wish you went down on the Titanic with all your sorority sisters.
April Ludgate,"No, I heard it, too."
April Ludgate,Champion?
April Ludgate,Are you gonna wear that?
April Ludgate,No
April Ludgate,"No, honey, no."
April Ludgate,I have some planning to do.
April Ludgate,You want me to find her?
April Ludgate,I want another nurse.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Don't listen to me, no."
April Ludgate,How are your local graveyards?
April Ludgate,Bingo.
April Ludgate,Donna.
April Ludgate,Nailed it.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you wanted to hold 1,000 dollars cash in your hands"
April Ludgate,"No, then we'd have to move again."
April Ludgate,"Vermin, bullet holes, a hornet's nest."
April Ludgate,This place has everything.
April Ludgate,And how much is left in the bank account?
April Ludgate,"Hey, what if I threw together a pet adoption in one of our parks would that be cool?"
April Ludgate,This one.
April Ludgate,"And silly straws all around, please."
April Ludgate,"I'll have a glass of your most expensive red wine mixed with a glass of your cheapest white wine, served in a dog bowl."
April Ludgate,It was actually Ginuwine who arranged everything.
April Ludgate,He really cares about you.
April Ludgate,"Yes, let's do it."
April Ludgate,"All right, well, this is what we're doing tonight."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Hey, there."
April Ludgate,"Okay, are you still mad at me about the poodle thing?"
April Ludgate,I can pick another dog.
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,I hate people.
April Ludgate,They should be rewarded for not being people.
April Ludgate,It's not like you know a ton about me.
April Ludgate,We don't hang out that much.
April Ludgate,I think I may have found a project I'd actually enjoy doing helping these cats and dogs.
April Ludgate,It was just a dumb game.
April Ludgate,"Um, I was at orientation, but it was lame, so I left."
April Ludgate,Mmmm.
April Ludgate,"God, get off me, stranger."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live."
April Ludgate,Ew.
April Ludgate,"No, you're not."
April Ludgate,"And then I kept walking, and now here I am."
April Ludgate,Yes!
April Ludgate,He's such a little runt.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, totally."
April Ludgate,I'm okay.
April Ludgate,I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,I was in Venezuela.
April Ludgate,"One year from now, you, Andy Dwyer, will no longer be a shoe shinist."
April Ludgate,I wouldn't worry about it.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,It's totally fine.
April Ludgate,"This is my boyfriend, Eduardo."
April Ludgate,That means we're going to lunch.
April Ludgate,He's really bad at digging.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,Except for digging.
April Ludgate,Because you're pretty and you like makeup and stuff.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,You have a bucket list?
April Ludgate,Do you?
April Ludgate,I'll help you figure it out.
April Ludgate,Can you guys just figure out which way is better and tell me so we can leave?
April Ludgate,"Andy, look at this little guy!"
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"You're not being very inclusive, Chris."
April Ludgate,I feel like my input isn't being appreciated.
April Ludgate,You've killed my spirit.
April Ludgate,My spirit blood is on your hands.
April Ludgate,I only agreed to come back here because of our deal.
April Ludgate,"There's, like, a ton of buildings near where Andy and I live, and they're all super cheap because they're empty and disgusting."
April Ludgate,Does it have to stay where it is?
April Ludgate,"Andy, there's tons of stuff you can do."
April Ludgate,Andy?
April Ludgate,Do you promise to play along?
April Ludgate,God.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Let's leave.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,I'm drunk.
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not."
April Ludgate,"It's my favorite kind of battle-- Two men enter, one me leaves."
April Ludgate,So gross!
April Ludgate,I'm drunk.
April Ludgate,You don't get your gut to talk to you.
April Ludgate,"You made me drunk, you made me drunk, and you"
April Ludgate,Have you not lost it?
April Ludgate,"And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann."
April Ludgate,You just listen when it says something.
April Ludgate,It's a pioneer girl watching her grandmother get trampled by a buffalo.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Listen to me.
April Ludgate,You make up songs all the time off the top of your head.
April Ludgate,You do.
April Ludgate,"You can do this, and afterwards, we can have cake."
April Ludgate,Good.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,"Oh, and I'll also steal Ron's watch, just for fun."""
April Ludgate,"They'll argue about dumb stuff that doesn't matter, and I will bail."
April Ludgate,"I'm getting notes of dried robin's blood, old, dirty cashews and just a hint of a robot's bathwater."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's not about following through, okay?"
April Ludgate,I was on the fence about whether I wanted to do it.
April Ludgate,"And as soon as I got there, I just had a gut feeling that it wasn't right for me, that's all."
April Ludgate,Right here.
April Ludgate,That's how I make all my life decisions.
April Ludgate,Then I'll steal $20 from Chris's wallet and buy pizza with Andy.
April Ludgate,"Andy, the word ""hair"" was not the problem with Sex Hair."
April Ludgate,"Recently I've been feeling like I've wasted the last 10 years of my life, and it all started with this internship."
April Ludgate,I convinced her to quit.
April Ludgate,"My gut is always right, okay?"
April Ludgate,You wanted to see me?
April Ludgate,"It was right about marrying Andy, and it was right when it told me that you would be the worst person I would ever meet in my life."
April Ludgate,I will pit Ron and Chris against each other.
April Ludgate,"And I don't want those kids to make the same mistake, okay?"
April Ludgate,It's not that big of a deal.
April Ludgate,This right here's all the blood coming out her face.
April Ludgate,The Wine Academy.
April Ludgate,"Uh, burn it for the insurance money."
April Ludgate,Oh.
April Ludgate,"I actually think that you should get a ""Hello Kitty"" tattoo."
April Ludgate,Here.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,I thought about this a lot.
April Ludgate,"God, nobody cares, Gary."
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,I kind of wanna drink alone.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,Oprah.
April Ludgate,Triple whiskey.
April Ludgate,Sure.
April Ludgate,"Solve this mystery, genius."
April Ludgate,But I said I wanna drink alone.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,You take this one.
April Ludgate,It costs 200 dollars to get certified.
April Ludgate,"April Ludgate, professional drinker."
April Ludgate,"He is, but it's actually $250 for short notice."
April Ludgate,You can call this number and ask for April Karate.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Babe
April Ludgate,That was amazing.
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,I kind of think you can make a career out of this.
April Ludgate,"Plus, you have never been sexier to me than when you were singing to those kids just now."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,My two true passions.
April Ludgate,I will get myself a martini from that idiot.
April Ludgate,I wanted to make fun of stupid people while I get drunk.
April Ludgate,Who cares about what you were supposed to be?
April Ludgate,I just stole your phone and texted every guy in it that the baby was theirs.
April Ludgate,This comes from your mother's butt.
April Ludgate,"What, Ann?"
April Ludgate,That dog is totally Tom!
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"I said, ""We have free wi-fi."""
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,No way.
April Ludgate,"And if you don't agree with us, it's nine against one, and we can make you disappear forever."
April Ludgate,That's something Andy does when he gets hot.
April Ludgate,Are you sure?
April Ludgate,If you can look at that site and not want to take home you're basically a war criminal.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"And Crazy Craig used to run all their shelters, so he helped me make an adoption website for all the dogs."
April Ludgate,Animal control had to take in all the pets from Eagleton.
April Ludgate,"Okay, whoever gets the most free stuff by the end of the night wins."
April Ludgate,See the way that dog is rolling around in a puddle?
April Ludgate,Nice.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,I'm sick.
April Ludgate,What are you talking about?
April Ludgate,"Norbit, uh, Pluto Nash, all the Klumps."
April Ludgate,I just want to thank all the people that got me here.
April Ludgate,"And if you spend more than $5 on wine, you are very stupid."
April Ludgate,I think we can agree that all wine tastes the same.
April Ludgate,We are going to all pick our spirit dogs.
April Ludgate,My blankets are on the floor.
April Ludgate,"Okay, important meeting in the conference room right now."
April Ludgate,Wow.
April Ludgate,Do?
April Ludgate,I can't do anything.
April Ludgate,"Thank you so much, everyone."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Leslie should stay here.
April Ludgate,You're doing a really bad job.
April Ludgate,"Wow, move all the way to Indianapolis, so I can pick up your vitamins and supplements."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I will.
April Ludgate,"I just thought, ""What would Leslie do?"" So I handed out flyers and I canvassed the college."
April Ludgate,What do you mean? I didn't say anything.
April Ludgate,I found a bunch of new potential interns to replace Jen.
April Ludgate,I am sorry that I screwed up your life.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"I can't take it any more, okay?"
April Ludgate,I even baked a bunch of cookies.
April Ludgate,I told him I had a pork deficiency.
April Ludgate,Stop yelling and being annoying.
April Ludgate,"That's gross, I love it."
April Ludgate,I'm breaking you up.
April Ludgate,You guys are done.
April Ludgate,I drew something on my arm.
April Ludgate,Why is your arm around her? I broke you up.
April Ludgate,I got this from a waiter.
April Ludgate,It was weird.
April Ludgate,I actually really enjoyed finding them.
April Ludgate,And I enjoyed bullying Jen into quitting.
April Ludgate,You have to tell me if I look good.
April Ludgate,This is important.
April Ludgate,You have to look.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,All my parents got me was that.
April Ludgate,"No, come on."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"If you see Andy, will you not tell him I'm here?"
April Ludgate,"Because of what happened, I don't want him to think--"
April Ludgate,What do you think?
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,This is that wine.
April Ludgate,"You should up your therapy to seven times a week, stop dressing that way and give me your wallet."
April Ludgate,Good idea.
April Ludgate,"You know in the movies, when the cops show up and they find lipstick on a wine glass next to a dead body?"
April Ludgate,Except no one dresses up like a janitor when they want to be slutty.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,Totes.
April Ludgate,Which one are you?
April Ludgate,Seriously?
April Ludgate,"Tom, this witch wants to reserve a park for her satanic ritual."
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,His arms are crossed because he's mad at all the other marshmallow workers for annoying him.
April Ludgate,Can I touch a dead body?
April Ludgate,"Excuse me, Mr. Haggerty."
April Ludgate,Can you help her?
April Ludgate,He actually used to run the Parks Department in his home country of Russia.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,How did you become a mortician?
April Ludgate,See?
April Ludgate,Can't I just sign up?
April Ludgate,A Larry voodoo doll?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Tom's your guy."
April Ludgate,"Tom, that's so sweet."
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I really like your museum.
April Ludgate,"Is there, like, a museum curator position I could apply for?"
April Ludgate,What else does he do?
April Ludgate,Parks can only be reserved for witch covens or slip-and-slide competitions.
April Ludgate,You like it?
April Ludgate,This is another dead end.
April Ludgate,You can't make museums about those.
April Ludgate,"The only things I like are dogs, sleeping late, and weird birthmarks."
April Ludgate,It's weird and sad and unnecessary.
April Ludgate,You love everything.
April Ludgate,About what?
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,I assumed it was the 1690s.
April Ludgate,"Leslie said it was a ""Come As You Were in the '90s"" party."
April Ludgate,She wants her ugly outfit back.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, Ann called."
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, but I am not like you."
April Ludgate,"Oh, we have a new policy."
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,The voodoo doll is reading my thoughts.
April Ludgate,These are really important.
April Ludgate,"""He was a beautiful Tinker Bell."""
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,It's not that great.
April Ludgate,"Plus, it's really far away from work and that'd be annoying."
April Ludgate,"It's okay, I took care of it."
April Ludgate,Sorry.
April Ludgate,What are you doing here?
April Ludgate,Kiss me!
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,Stop singing!
April Ludgate,"Okay, what's in there?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Iit's locked.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,I didn't even do anything.
April Ludgate,I made a marshmallow Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate,William Henry Harrison is totally ridiculous.
April Ludgate,Why is every job just paperwork?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"I think we're gonna go, Dan."
April Ludgate,The reality of your life is incredibly depressing.
April Ludgate,"I'm just gonna stay at my current job until I get old and die and then end up here, being embalmed by some weirdo who had to go to school for three years just to cut my guts open."
April Ludgate,"Babe, you love that band that I also love so much."
April Ludgate,What's in that jug? It smells like jet fuel.
April Ludgate,They're important to you.
April Ludgate,Let's go.
April Ludgate,"And while you're here, why not visit the Other Famous Harrisons exhibit?"
April Ludgate,"Oh, and side note, admission to this museum costs 14 dollars."
April Ludgate,This room is called Other Things That Were Famous For One Month.
April Ludgate,The If He'd Worn A Coat room explores how great America would have been if Harrison had worn a coat at his inauguration and not died.
April Ludgate,They can't even fill a small museum with real stuff about his life because he was so lame.
April Ludgate,"Come on, call Burly and ask him to let you back in."
April Ludgate,I want to put them on stop signs.
April Ludgate,Can I have these question mark stickers?
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,I'm sorry this town keeps being stupid and letting you down.
April Ludgate,It sucks.
April Ludgate,The cadaver chute.
April Ludgate,Come on!
April Ludgate,I don't want you to go back to London.
April Ludgate,I can't breathe.
April Ludgate,They're just shouting louder than everyone else.
April Ludgate,That's crazy.
April Ludgate,There's a brook somewhere that won't stop babbling.
April Ludgate,Shut up!
April Ludgate,I wish.
April Ludgate,"Hey, you're also wearing a tie-dye tshirt."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that is really lame, and I'm leaving."
April Ludgate,Do you want me to bite him?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, Leslie."
April Ludgate,Do you think there's actually a mistake in here?
April Ludgate,"Andy, don't joke around."
April Ludgate,I just wanted you to have a brief moment of happiness before you got sadder.
April Ludgate,The air is too fresh.
April Ludgate,It's disgusting.
April Ludgate,Wha--
April Ludgate,What the hell?
April Ludgate,Eww!
April Ludgate,"I knew if he found something that he actually liked doing, he'd be happy, so I'mâ¦"
April Ludgate,Those jerks that hate the merger are a minority.
April Ludgate,This is the first time he's really gone out on a limb.
April Ludgate,What are you wearing?
April Ludgate,See you on stupid Skype.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,"Um well, there is some good news."
April Ludgate,"That Mike Patterson guy's show just aired, everyone is angry, and Jamm is introducing a secession bill at the next city council meeting."
April Ludgate,It's not.
April Ludgate,I'm proud of Andy.
April Ludgate,What's that?
April Ludgate,"""Friendship rankings."""
April Ludgate,"Gay penguins, parks, sugar, parks."
April Ludgate,Throw up.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, it's definitely Ron's mom."
April Ludgate,Prove it.
April Ludgate,Now be the Chuck Norris of making out with me.
April Ludgate,That's great.
April Ludgate,"""Ladies' choice."""
April Ludgate,You still love it?
April Ludgate,"Ooh, I love watching Russian traffic accidents on YouTube while I play children's music at the wrong RPM."
April Ludgate,Hello?
April Ludgate,Yay.
April Ludgate,Peebo.
April Ludgate,I want to play!
April Ludgate,Watch this.
April Ludgate,"Speaking of London, you haven't told me anything about work."
April Ludgate,"Hello, I'm April Ludgate."
April Ludgate,"Okay, could you just skip ahead a little?"
April Ludgate,You're the best husband ever.
April Ludgate,"Parks, parks, parks, parks, parks, parks, Michelle Obama, parks."
April Ludgate,Listen up while I talk about some really important stuff.
April Ludgate,"Hey, everybody."
April Ludgate,Check out my four color pen.
April Ludgate,Women should do everything.
April Ludgate,"This is an impression of my boss, Leslie Knope."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,I love Ritalin and have low self-esteem.
April Ludgate,"Hi, I'm Natalie."
April Ludgate,This is an impression of my sister.
April Ludgate,Yep.
April Ludgate,I'm going to do impressions.
April Ludgate,And Pawnee is my favorite place in the world!
April Ludgate,"I like people, places and things!"
April Ludgate,I'm 20 years old.
April Ludgate,"Babe, we should sell our dumb house and buy this one."
April Ludgate,"My God, Andy, I don't even wanna be here."
April Ludgate,This place is awesome.
April Ludgate,What the hell?
April Ludgate,I'm subbing in.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,90 dollars?
April Ludgate,I'm Puerto Rican.
April Ludgate,I can handle it.
April Ludgate,"oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,Wait.
April Ludgate,Are you okay?
April Ludgate,Hail Zorp.
April Ludgate,"Well, I got you something to cheer you up."
April Ludgate,Watch cologne.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,I can't believe you like beauty pageants.
April Ludgate,"I didn't want Tom to leave, so I said all these bad things about the restaurant, so he wouldn't like them."
April Ludgate,"It's so crazy, it almost sounds made up."
April Ludgate,"Okay, but you can't tell Leslie I might leave."
April Ludgate,Tommy.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but it's not what you think."
April Ludgate,I don't like heights.
April Ludgate,"Yes, but he said he wanted to do it."
April Ludgate,"It's either that, or you talk like that for the rest of your life."
April Ludgate,"They do this thing called a ""shopping period,"" where you can just sample as many classes as you want."
April Ludgate,This place is creepy.
April Ludgate,You can say that again.
April Ludgate,Blood orphans.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,"I mean, I love it, because it reminds me of the cafeteria in a haunted nursing home, but that's just me."
April Ludgate,You opened another dinosaur themed restaurant?
April Ludgate,That's the most I've ever liked Ann.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Oh, you know."
April Ludgate,Just regionally directing the Midwest whatever of who cares.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Ben! God, don't say that."
April Ludgate,I'm only doing it because I'm getting him back--
April Ludgate,"Oh, I thought you were just bad at your job."
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,"""Thank you for the 500 dollars."""
April Ludgate,He's a man.
April Ludgate,"""I hope someday, I can become half the woman you are."""
April Ludgate,And of murder.
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,"""You are a beautiful and amazing woman."""
April Ludgate,It was 5 dollars.
April Ludgate,"No, I think it just seems small because of all the heavy furniture."
April Ludgate,Mmhm.
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not."
April Ludgate,"""Dear April's grandmother"" I said grandfather."
April Ludgate,"I know, crazy, right? Real estate."
April Ludgate,Someone will die.
April Ludgate,Fake blood capsules.
April Ludgate,"Wait, wait."
April Ludgate,Sorry.
April Ludgate,Beauty pageants are idiotic.
April Ludgate,The lighting is really cool.
April Ludgate,What should we do?
April Ludgate,She'll have a heart attack.
April Ludgate,"So, I was just at The Grind and I thought you might want an iced mocha with extra, extra whipped cream."
April Ludgate,Mutilated bodies.
April Ludgate,Promise?
April Ludgate,Dead people that we just murdered.
April Ludgate,But that part is really great.
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
April Ludgate,He is deaf.
April Ludgate,"""Enjoy the Mouse Rat CD."""
April Ludgate,Bloody goblins.
April Ludgate,Why are you so into helping me right now?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I think this is the one.
April Ludgate,"Oh, by the way, completely unrelated, I just signed up for the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."
April Ludgate,I feel totally lost.
April Ludgate,"Donna, what do I do? If working around corpses isn't even right for me, then nothing is."
April Ludgate,I don't like depths.
April Ludgate,I'm camping with people I work with.
April Ludgate,I believe her name was Satan?
April Ludgate,"Wait, I thought you weren't gonna do Galentine's day this year because that she-beast moved away."
April Ludgate,"Andy, you have to save me."
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,You sound like a tampon commercial.
April Ludgate,"Just take something you're great at and get an easy ""A""."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Can I get back to work now?
April Ludgate,"Ew, my husband, weirdo."
April Ludgate,Whoa I thought you weren't gonna lose it.
April Ludgate,I didn't come up with anything.
April Ludgate,"Um, spoilers much?"
April Ludgate,"Oh, babe, I'm sorry you had to hear that."
April Ludgate,We could get Leslie some marshmallow fluff.
April Ludgate,I'm going to murder you a thousand times.
April Ludgate,I have some right here.
April Ludgate,"""Jerrold starred in his school production of Peter Pan."""
April Ludgate,See ya.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you owe me, like, 1,000 favors."
April Ludgate,Now I'll never read that book.
April Ludgate,"""January 18, 1964."""
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,"He's sweet, he's cool, and you're, like, way out of his league, so there's literally no risk for you at all here."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Tom wants me to tell you that all the screw-ups were my fault, but really, he kept messing up so that you would stay in Pawnee as long as possible because he is super into you."
April Ludgate,You're safe now.
April Ludgate,Give me that.
April Ludgate,Never broaden your horizons.
April Ludgate,Horizons are dumb.
April Ludgate,"Because I know that whatever we come up with isn't gonna be good enough anyway, and we're just gonna go with your idea."
April Ludgate,Nothing!
April Ludgate,"It's too tight, looser."
April Ludgate,This is amazing.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"So, are you gonna vote for me, sister?"
April Ludgate,I can be idiotic for 600 dollars.
April Ludgate,The coffee is 7 dollars.
April Ludgate,"If you want to have a chance with her, obviously, you have to stop."
April Ludgate,Computer.
April Ludgate,Executive.
April Ludgate,"So, just give up."
April Ludgate,You're not gonna be able to find a career for me.
April Ludgate,But I found out that the winner of the Miss Pawnee Pageant gets 600 dollars.
April Ludgate,"I don't like anything, okay?"
April Ludgate,Trampoline.
April Ludgate,That's fun.
April Ludgate,"So, you've gone insane."
April Ludgate,Did you change your outfit?
April Ludgate,The Internet's not working.
April Ludgate,Did you just scoop it out of the jar with your hand like a bear?
April Ludgate,We need your help.
April Ludgate,It kind of seems like you should at least give him a heads-up so he doesn't get rejected again.
April Ludgate,Because he's been super sad lately.
April Ludgate,"God, this goes on for, like, seven pages!"
April Ludgate,"No, I told you, I'm a sumo wrestler after he lost the weight."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, seems like we all had a phenomenal evening."
April Ludgate,Still not working.
April Ludgate,"Okay, it's working."
April Ludgate,Hmm.
April Ludgate,"Eyeballs wrapped, uhm vampire teeth"
April Ludgate,Good.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Spider webs.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I'm just really interested in learning what you do.
April Ludgate,"We're inside the main entrance, near the sign that says ""Pawnee Campground."""
April Ludgate,Where are you?
April Ludgate,That weird cologne party thing at the Snakehole?
April Ludgate,Why don't we go to Tom's thing?
April Ludgate,"Well, you overestimated how much I care what happens to Kyle."
April Ludgate,"Or anyone, really."
April Ludgate,But I'm sorry that I didn't just talk to you.
April Ludgate,It's so stupid.
April Ludgate,You do?
April Ludgate,Shut up.
April Ludgate,Your lipstick looks weird.
April Ludgate,Good talk.
April Ludgate,This was a doll head factory?
April Ludgate,So this place has had zero offers?
April Ludgate,"I'm so sorry, honey, but Tynny and I won't sign anything until we speak with our life coach."
April Ludgate,"I think you need a spa day, Les."
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,"""I hate Ann because of this stupid reason."""
April Ludgate,I did.
April Ludgate,He takes really long sadness baths and makes me late for stuff.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,Is that a staircase to nowhere?
April Ludgate,All right.
April Ludgate,"Unless Andy can unkiss Ann, then I'm not going to change my mind."
April Ludgate,"Donna, Kyle did not write those things, okay?"
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I thought it was really cool how everything fell apart in there.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,"When Ben gets upset, he becomes a really bad roommate."
April Ludgate,"But if he wants to take my dumb sister to her dumb dance class, then I'm not going to dumb stop him."
April Ludgate,How did that guy know where to find you?
April Ludgate,You signed your real name?
April Ludgate,"And also, maybe you should talk to Ben."
April Ludgate,I guess we're dating.
April Ludgate,"""And I hate Tom for this stupid reason."""
April Ludgate,Seriously?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, and Larry, by the way, you're looking in the wrong spot."
April Ludgate,There's been a mistake.
April Ludgate,Also-- I'm the zodiac killer.
April Ludgate,"I'm just an impartial bunny, but I think Ann sucks."
April Ludgate,"Mm, you touch me and I stab the bunny."
April Ludgate,"We know you've been missing Ann, so we got you this."
April Ludgate,"This says that I'm in charge of the silly skeleton room, when really it should say ""the undead serial killer room."""
April Ludgate,"Hi, Joan."
April Ludgate,And I'm your biggest fan and I pretty much hate everyone.
April Ludgate,Will you sign your ninth memoir for me?
April Ludgate,Like a solid B-minus.
April Ludgate,I think you're fine.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I did."
April Ludgate,Who cares?
April Ludgate,"Hi, my name is April."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,Who do I talk to about changing this?
April Ludgate,"Ugh, just when we were rid of him?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but summer's gonna totally kick ass."
April Ludgate,"Oh, Gross!"
April Ludgate,It's not.
April Ludgate,What's it called?
April Ludgate,"Every year, we would dress up like demons and egg Larry's house."
April Ludgate,"Halloween was, like, kind of our thing."
April Ludgate,"Your inhaler is hidden under the pile of pistachio shells on my desk, obviously."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I just miss Andy."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's not like everyone's gonna suddenly start holding hands and making out, but we figure, why not throw a big three-day outdoor party, show everyone a good time, and maybe they'll forget about this stupid stuff."
April Ludgate,"Oh, right, you don't know Leslie."
April Ludgate,That means she loves it so much she can't speak.
April Ludgate,Parties.
April Ludgate,"What are you doing here, Jerry? I thought you were fired."
April Ludgate,Watch out.
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah?"
April Ludgate,It's new.
April Ludgate,Whatever!
April Ludgate,I don't like labels.
April Ludgate,He's right.
April Ludgate,That's it.
April Ludgate,There's no more left.
April Ludgate,"Well, who cares, really?"
April Ludgate,It's just some dumb internet person.
April Ludgate,Ignore it.
April Ludgate,This class stinks.
April Ludgate,"I'll go with you, because Leslie's making us, and we live together, and we only have one car right now because you laked mine."
April Ludgate,"We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special."
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,And I hate punch.
April Ludgate,The guillotine was invented here.
April Ludgate,"Gross, Jerry."
April Ludgate,"You know, why are you guys even fighting anyway?"
April Ludgate,City Hall is run by the walrus mafia.
April Ludgate,Easy: Most murders per capita.
April Ludgate,"Fine, I'll do it."
April Ludgate,You know it.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,"Um, we also came up with these nicknames for each other."
April Ludgate,Slut and Skank.
April Ludgate,"Uh, yeah, she does."
April Ludgate,Do you have Internet in your office?
April Ludgate,Why'd you pay for a limo?
April Ludgate,"Ew, no one wants your dirty underwear, Ben."
April Ludgate,"Well, that seals it."
April Ludgate,"How crazemazing is that, Lez?"
April Ludgate,Even Leslie is crazier than we are.
April Ludgate,That sounds boring.
April Ludgate,But I have nothing keeping me here.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,It's on.
April Ludgate,It's literally my worst nightmare.
April Ludgate,"Prom is nothing but a huge party full of smiling, dancing people enjoying themselves."
April Ludgate,I have one sister.
April Ludgate,Back up.
April Ludgate,"If you do everything I hate for a month, then I might begin to think about the possibility of thinking about maybe staying."
April Ludgate,Back up.
April Ludgate,"You're not part of the party, you can't have the candy."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"We steal each other's stuff, hack each other's Twitter accounts, set each other's clothes on fire."
April Ludgate,"Oh, really?"
April Ludgate,Thought you weren't coming to the party.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ben."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he went to high school with my sister, Natalie."
April Ludgate,He was a big deal on the football team.
April Ludgate,Who's it going to?
April Ludgate,Go away.
April Ludgate,"Chris, this is"
April Ludgate,There are no rules.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"Professor Linda, this is Chris."
April Ludgate,"After we drop off the renters insurance forms, we need to stop by the grocery store."
April Ludgate,And then we need to sign a suicide pact because our lives are meaningless.
April Ludgate,It's the creepy warehouse district.
April Ludgate,The Moon shall join your coalition.
April Ludgate,It's mostly just raccoons and old car batteries.
April Ludgate,Whoa! Hang on.
April Ludgate,Pull over.
April Ludgate,Look at that.
April Ludgate,This place is amazing.
April Ludgate,Let's go in!
April Ludgate,"She's the cold, distant mother I never had."
April Ludgate,I love her.
April Ludgate,Classic Pilo.
April Ludgate,Look who I found.
April Ludgate,It turns out Chris is my real dad.
April Ludgate,"Joan has always been kind of a train wreck, but the last three years, she's gone off the deep end."
April Ludgate,She did a string of shows from rehab.
April Ludgate,She once gave every member in her audience a car.
April Ludgate,"One car, that they all had to fight for."
April Ludgate,"So, the first person who hacks their face off gets released."
April Ludgate,And I left a rusty hacksaw on the table.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,This is for a fence?
April Ludgate,We don't get cash?
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,I quit.
April Ludgate,That's right.
April Ludgate,Except hearing Joan talk about her passion and doing what you really love totally freaked me out.
April Ludgate,"Eight years ago, I accepted a random internship at the parks department, and then Leslie told me to do a bunch of stuff, and now I'm executive director of regional whatever, and I don't even know what it means."
April Ludgate,And I never even asked myself if I even really like it.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,You can't lean in to whisper and then yell.
April Ludgate,That's not fair.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"I mean, it's like, what is my purpose in life?"
April Ludgate,I quit.
April Ludgate,I really hope he's there when she walks in and he throws a basketball at her head.
April Ludgate,"But in reality, it's terrible."
April Ludgate,Hello.
April Ludgate,Come on.
April Ludgate,Both of you.
April Ludgate,"You guys are being stupid, so why don't you work it out while Andy and I"
April Ludgate,"Stop it, Terry!"
April Ludgate,"No, I didn't win."
April Ludgate,Come by anytime.
April Ludgate,"The gate kind of jams sometimes, but you can just jump it."
April Ludgate,"In here, it says that Pawnee is great."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, actually."
April Ludgate,It's Dwayne Wade's house.
April Ludgate,I got his address off the Internet.
April Ludgate,But at least I didn't make any new friendships.
April Ludgate,Just let yourself in.
April Ludgate,What do I even care about?
April Ludgate,"No more press, okay?"
April Ludgate,You just have to lay low for a while.
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,Obviously.
April Ludgate,Andy.
April Ludgate,Andy.
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,That it doesn't count as stripping if no one pays you?
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,It says here the future of caskets may just be biodegradable plastic.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,You don't know what you're talking about.
April Ludgate,Fish are gross.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Go.
April Ludgate,See ya.
April Ludgate,And Bette Midler.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I know you're in there."
April Ludgate,I promise it'll all blow over.
April Ludgate,"Fine, but no cameras."
April Ludgate,My insides are dying.
April Ludgate,I don't know what to do.
April Ludgate,I have to quit.
April Ludgate,"Dude, dumb it down."
April Ludgate,We need to talk.
April Ludgate,Get out!
April Ludgate,"Yeah, plus look how bad they are without you."
April Ludgate,Burly's terrible.
April Ludgate,"Right, that's what I meant."
April Ludgate,"I love Andy, but to be perfectly honest, Mouse Rat's music is not my thing."
April Ludgate,"I really only listen to, like, German Death Reggae and Halloween sound effects records from the 1950s."
April Ludgate,"Andy, come on."
April Ludgate,I'm just gonna go live under a bridge and ask people riddles before they cross.
April Ludgate,I've never used a phone in my life.
April Ludgate,"No, Andy."
April Ludgate,It's a Christmas miracle.
April Ludgate,okay.
April Ludgate,"No, no, no, babe."
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,"Hey, one question."
April Ludgate,"Kinda sounds like one of your songs, babe."
April Ludgate,"Wait, Andy, this is a Mouse Rat song."
April Ludgate,"Um, where do you think you're gonna stand, in front of the graffiti that says ""Pawnee, you suck,"" or ""Go home, Eagleton snobs""?"
April Ludgate,"Babe, don't touch those."
April Ludgate,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,"Yes, I used cookies instead of bread."
April Ludgate,I made you five bologna sandwiches in case you get hungry on the way to the airport.
April Ludgate,"Wait, wait, wait."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,You don't want this job.
April Ludgate,I guess we'll just have to take that chance.
April Ludgate,Love you too.
April Ludgate,"Seriously, this place is the pits."
April Ludgate,"Honey, he's wearing a costume."
April Ludgate,"Like, so much fun."
April Ludgate,"Oh, and last year, she did a show where she called all of her exboyfriends while sitting on a washing machine."
April Ludgate,I love her so much.
April Ludgate,I hope she's my real mom.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Should we do something?
April Ludgate,Do you want the door open or shut?
April Ludgate,"Can I just say something, though?"
April Ludgate,I think we should book Orin as a headliner.
April Ludgate,"Um, he dislocates his shoulder to the music of Billy Joel."
April Ludgate,"The Pawnee Journal called it, ""Why would anyone do this?"""
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,I need more flu medicine.
April Ludgate,He's going as lame.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, me too."
April Ludgate,I think it's a no-brainer.
April Ludgate,Chris got dumped by Jerry's daughter.
April Ludgate,He needs this.
April Ludgate,I didn't take any.
April Ludgate,You said you were like Chuck Norris.
April Ludgate,But you said everything was going awesome.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Can you do something?
April Ludgate,You should totally stay at my house in Miami.
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Can I just say something?
April Ludgate,Anything.
April Ludgate,These are the Blackeyed Peas.
April Ludgate,Do I even like my job?
April Ludgate,I better be the only person you kissed today.
April Ludgate,You want to do this again tomorrow?
April Ludgate,And I finally killed them.
April Ludgate,It was? Yeah.
April Ludgate,Andy's just acting out scenes from his favorite movies.
April Ludgate,I can't get through to the cable company.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna tell you a secret about everyone else's job.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,"Plus, if they get married, he'll spend all his time with her, and I might never have to talk to him again."
April Ludgate,Hmm.
April Ludgate,"Professor Linda, you have Really nice arms."
April Ludgate,"It's like, if you worked here, you'd be like, ""Ugh!"""
April Ludgate,"Leslie, this guy's here."
April Ludgate,"And you will too, because you are awesome and everyone else sucks."
April Ludgate,"Deep down, everyone is just faking it until they figure it out."
April Ludgate,Leslie came in here and stole it and left.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I seem like it."
April Ludgate,Half the documents I get I put right into the shredder because they're so boring.
April Ludgate,I don't know how to run an animal control department.
April Ludgate,No one knows what they're doing.
April Ludgate,Do you work out?
April Ludgate,"And Leslie would be like, ""Blah, blah, blah."""
April Ludgate,"And you'd be like, ""Uh"""
April Ludgate,How did it go today?
April Ludgate,"Well, what is your dream?"
April Ludgate,I've never cared for you.
April Ludgate,"Remember phase 13, ""Think outside of the box""?"
April Ludgate,But only if you divorce Ben.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,Easy peasy.
April Ludgate,"In today's fast-paced society, National Parks are still the best place for full moon werewolf transformations."
April Ludgate,Let's sacrifice Larry.
April Ludgate,Enough chitchat.
April Ludgate,Lemon sneezy.
April Ludgate,"Well, it is simple, Leslie."
April Ludgate,Can I join?
April Ludgate,I really think he's wrong for you.
April Ludgate,Are you in a cult?
April Ludgate,What the hell is wrong with you?
April Ludgate,I'm really glad I married you.
April Ludgate,Nuhuh!
April Ludgate,"God, people here are so cheap."
April Ludgate,You say that every morning.
April Ludgate,To go in that room and finish this book.
April Ludgate,"Andy got back from London two days ago, and he still has jet lag."
April Ludgate,"Chris's assistant went back to Indianapolis, so he's borrowing me for a few days."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"""It's Kathy that started"" I don't care!"
April Ludgate,50 dollars.
April Ludgate,Because you basically founded this new town.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's so much fun."
April Ludgate,What about this?
April Ludgate,"Candy bars, 50 dollars."
April Ludgate,"God, Larry, you sneezed all over us!"
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,We've talked about this.
April Ludgate,Get it together.
April Ludgate,Remember? I wanna wait until we're 50 and then adopt a set of creepy adult twins from Romania.
April Ludgate,"Actually, there is something I need to tell you."
April Ludgate,You said you wanted a little drama.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I don't wanna say it out loud.
April Ludgate,We are definitely coming to this.
April Ludgate,Is there anything else to eat? The marshmallows are all gone.
April Ludgate,"Also, you have lipstick on your teeth."
April Ludgate,"Come on, time is money, money is power, power is pizza, pizza is knowledge, let's go."
April Ludgate,"What's your pitch, kid?"
April Ludgate,"Because I don't even know if I wanna go, okay? I mean, yes, it's been my dream to work with animals since I was a kid and everything."
April Ludgate,"But it would mean I would be spending a lot of time apart from you, and"
April Ludgate,"Okay, a while ago, I applied to veterinary school in Bloomington, and I just found out that I got in."
April Ludgate,Their first project will be to come up with a shorter name for the group.
April Ludgate,"Your main goal today is to get 2,000 people to sign up for the Pawnee Eagleton merger preservation volunteer action squad."
April Ludgate,I think I will celebrate with a drink.
April Ludgate,"You hungry, Champion?"
April Ludgate,Got it.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, are you kidding me?"
April Ludgate,"Andy, you have got to stay up and get on a regular schedule!"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"If Ann is yours, you need to tell her."
April Ludgate,So everybody has things they care about.
April Ludgate,"And I want Leslie to win, and I like sleeping."
April Ludgate,So I think it should be absorbed into the Parks Department.
April Ludgate,Babe!
April Ludgate,Could you just be still?
April Ludgate,"Well, what do you wanna do?"
April Ludgate,You want five million orange Postits.
April Ludgate,What portion of this camping trip will take place outside?
April Ludgate,Where are you guys going?
April Ludgate,Pass.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"No, Tom, don't."
April Ludgate,"Its budget is tiny, and it's ineffective, and frankly, no one could change that."
April Ludgate,There shouldn't be a separate Animal Control Department.
April Ludgate,I knew you wouldn't care.
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,"Babe, wake up."
April Ludgate,"No, not at all."
April Ludgate,It's really annoying.
April Ludgate,Document what?
April Ludgate,Yay!
April Ludgate,"Thirsty there, big guy?"
April Ludgate,"Animal Control would be way more effective if it ran through the Parks Department, and if you want, I can write up an official report in language simple enough for even you dummies to understand, dummies."
April Ludgate,It's 100 dollars.
April Ludgate,We're on totally different schedules.
April Ludgate,Last night he mowed the lawn at 2:00 in the morning.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,This has to stop.
April Ludgate,"Laugh all you want, Kyle."
April Ludgate,I don't remember that.
April Ludgate,I already took the money out of your wallet.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,All right.
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
April Ludgate,"No, Andy."
April Ludgate,"As soon as I wake up he goes down, hard."
April Ludgate,Ron Swanson Scholarship.
April Ludgate,"Mm, no."
April Ludgate,Her boob kills.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,No one gives a [bleep]. And Ginuwine.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I get why you're bummed out."
April Ludgate,"Oh, so that's why you've been so nice to him and let him carry all your stuff."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Poor guy.
April Ludgate,This is your chance.
April Ludgate,Oh!
April Ludgate,"Honey, I'm not pregnant, okay? And if I were, you shouldn't lift me up."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,The KKK guy?
April Ludgate,"Oh, cool."
April Ludgate,Trunk.
April Ludgate,I'm just glad you're here. Can we make out now?
April Ludgate,Is that where you're gonna sit?
April Ludgate,Then how is this even a promotion?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"Well, I want a billion teddy bears."
April Ludgate,Can I buy a child bride?
April Ludgate,"Andy, you said you wanted to be an action star."
April Ludgate,They already moved.
April Ludgate,"I mean, look at me, I'm younger than you, and I already have my own department."
April Ludgate,"Plus I'm married, and I make more money than you."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Also, tell me your secret."
April Ludgate,Forever.
April Ludgate,"Hey, I love you."
April Ludgate,"Okay, so when this ends, we have a half hour to get to the next party."
April Ludgate,"Leslie, relax."
April Ludgate,Aah!
April Ludgate,Deal.
April Ludgate,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I might be going to Venezuela tomorrow."
April Ludgate,I'm fine.
April Ludgate,"One time, Andy told her that I was getting rid of my bangs and she called 911."
April Ludgate,Can I hire a Mexican elf?
April Ludgate,She freaks out when anything changes.
April Ludgate,Ready!
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I'm going to go look by myself.
April Ludgate,Are you leaving?
April Ludgate,"Okay, put me down."
April Ludgate,Just hold up this butter knife to my throat and pretend like you're holding me hostage.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you, Natalie, follow the action."
April Ludgate,It's awesome.
April Ludgate,"Well, then, welcome to the Terrordome."
April Ludgate,"That gives us 15 minutes of travel time, and 15 minutes for you to take a wetnap shower in the car."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Can I hire an intern?
April Ludgate,"Here, sit on my lap."
April Ludgate,"We have 1000 dollars in our bank account, and we're young and irresponsible."
April Ludgate,"Babe, you don't have to hide from me."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'll go with him."
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,Did you call me?
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,"No, it isn't."
April Ludgate,That's my boss!
April Ludgate,"I don't care about the secret anymore, okay?"
April Ludgate,"""Macaroni and Poison,"" it's like mac and cheese, but with a special ingredient."
April Ludgate,Goodbye.
April Ludgate,I can see you.
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,"Andy, the camo is not working."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Meagles, I am not screwing around, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Lauren, no more discussion of Majorca."
April Ludgate,Majorca is off limits.
April Ludgate,"Brian and Gloria, stop making Horatio feel bad that your daughter went to Yale."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I got one."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,So I'll steal my dad's car.
April Ludgate,How's everything going?
April Ludgate,How did you make this plaque so quickly?
April Ludgate,You've got to win me a teddy bear.
April Ludgate,But that means you probably shouldn't do it.
April Ludgate,"But did you, though?"
April Ludgate,I would love it if you ran an insane campaign and basically turned into the Joker.
April Ludgate,Yes!
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Well, as acting manager of the Parks Department, I declare that everything you are saying is stupid."
April Ludgate,"Oh, and also, I have a middle seat."
April Ludgate,"Look, this is a stupid idea, but right at this exact second, we have enough momentum to do something stupid before we realize how stupid it is."
April Ludgate,Beavers did it!
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Go away, Jerry."
April Ludgate,"His exwife Tammy came, and he got scared and ran away."
April Ludgate,"Mouse Rat CD, 30 dollars."
April Ludgate,I trust you.
April Ludgate,"I just thought, when we got married, we would share everything, but if you really can't tell me or whatever, it's fine."
April Ludgate,"That's not fair, my cell phone is how I avoid doing work."
April Ludgate,No cell phone usage on City Hall property?
April Ludgate,"Hey, guys."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, this makes me like you more."
April Ludgate,I'm not upset.
April Ludgate,"That's your new name, Garry."
April Ludgate,And I'll be the Moon.
April Ludgate,Oh my God.
April Ludgate,I can print more.
April Ludgate,Maybe Little Sebastian got upset because he tried to share his true feelings with someone and they didn't reciprocate.
April Ludgate,Especially since my stupid boyfriend abandoned me!
April Ludgate,They're creepy.
April Ludgate,Donna.
April Ludgate,That's my husband.
April Ludgate,"And you can see the stars, which I hate."
April Ludgate,It's super boring.
April Ludgate,I'm fine with not camping.
April Ludgate,"I guess my first move as director would be to fill your office, house, and car with snakes, and then train a crow to fly up your butt."
April Ludgate,"We just removed the splash guard because if it's not there, you can't put your mouth on it."
April Ludgate,Camping sucks.
April Ludgate,This is what happens when you try.
April Ludgate,And we hope you agree that this is the best plan to preserve National Parks' funding into the next decade.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but doesn't that bum you out?"
April Ludgate,That counts as winning the lottery.
April Ludgate,"Dude, if you think that's bad, go to Google Earth and type in your address."
April Ludgate,Where is everyone?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Ron, you want to stay outside and do nothing while they make your cabin look like garbage?"
April Ludgate,You have to stop your stupid swagger and just tell her in a normal voice that you care about her.
April Ludgate,"Dude, that's not why she broke up with you."
April Ludgate,"That's, like, the hilarious part."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,What happened?
April Ludgate,All of these animals are gonna die.
April Ludgate,"I'm trying to clean up for the party, but I swear to God, my arms can't move that way."
April Ludgate,Where have you been?
April Ludgate,What if we sleep to a normal hour?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,How did I do?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Um, there are these things called cookies, where, like you go to a site and buy something, it'll remember you and then create ads for other stuff you might want to buy."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,That's the best one.
April Ludgate,Don't worry.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he does being a mini-horse, and he does it better than anyone."
April Ludgate,Who was Laura Mulvey?
April Ludgate,Why is it so dead?
April Ludgate,Girl.
April Ludgate,It's the opposite.
April Ludgate,This guy's here.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, we'll be fine."
April Ludgate,"This is the most amazing grilled cheese sandwich ever made, okay?"
April Ludgate,"I want to not do things, just like you taught me."
April Ludgate,"Ugh, I can't believe I got them back together."
April Ludgate,"Bye, Kyle."
April Ludgate,I don't want to do things.
April Ludgate,It wasn't me.
April Ludgate,Lie.
April Ludgate,This place is lamer than outside.
April Ludgate,There are no TVs anywhere.
April Ludgate,"No, no, no, dude, seriously."
April Ludgate,Not good.
April Ludgate,Those are personal.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,No one's allowed to read those.
April Ludgate,Now they're always gonna want to come talk to me about stuff.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that lady is the worst."
April Ludgate,Alcohol is delicious and fun
April Ludgate,Easily.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,It's like a joke how long it takes to get here.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,She didn't even say thank you.
April Ludgate,"So I've been talking to Larry, and he's definitely not dying."
April Ludgate,"Good job, babe."
April Ludgate,"Andy, I was nice to Larry."
April Ludgate,"Mmm, it's pretty awesome."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,Are you gonna be okay with Ben still here?
April Ludgate,I scratched his back.
April Ludgate,What? I don't trust him.
April Ludgate,"No, he went back to Venezuela."
April Ludgate,How can you do that to me?
April Ludgate,I had a conversation with him.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I never have.
April Ludgate,He's after your money.
April Ludgate,What is that?
April Ludgate,Leslie's making us go on a camping retreat.
April Ludgate,"And me, Odie the dog, Garfield's enemy."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, her name was Khongordzol, and I love her more than anything in the world."
April Ludgate,Okay But only because you begged.
April Ludgate,It was horrible.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Who's Gary?
April Ludgate,It's like a meta-cabin.
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,"""For sale."""
April Ludgate,"""Small house."""
April Ludgate,"""Location: Forest."""
April Ludgate,"It's a little wordy, don't you think?"
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,"Told youif you can't remember what some woman did, just tear up and say, ""she changed my life."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like how they drive on the other side of the road."
April Ludgate,Do you like the Lord Fancyface Guy?
April Ludgate,I think you should do it.
April Ludgate,When are you gonna have another opportunity like this?
April Ludgate,"And, plus, we can deal with the distance, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Remember, I was in Washington last year."
April Ludgate,And I will be providing my world famous $100 lap dances.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,You shined shoes for over two years and never made a profit.
April Ludgate,"Come on, you can hack this."
April Ludgate,I believe in you.
April Ludgate,"But to replace you, I am going to have to build a scarecrow replica of you and take it to the movies."
April Ludgate,"Aw, for me?"
April Ludgate,The Moon accepts your ridiculous proposal.
April Ludgate,"Moon or quit, man."
April Ludgate,So it's kind of awesome that the Lord Fancyface Guy wants you to stay.
April Ludgate,The spirit dog committee ruled on that weeks ago.
April Ludgate,"I'm the Moon, or I quit."
April Ludgate,I'm just calling to let you know that Chris can't make lunch today.
April Ludgate,This is April.
April Ludgate,"Hi, Ann."
April Ludgate,Copy that.
April Ludgate,Neither of us should get the job.
April Ludgate,But neither is your guy.
April Ludgate,"Yes, but I hate them."
April Ludgate,"Hey, give him a chance."
April Ludgate,Get back here and get your [Bleep] cats out of there!
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,That's true.
April Ludgate,Trust me.
April Ludgate,"No! All right, I have an idea."
April Ludgate,"""Any woman caught laughing is a witch."""
April Ludgate,You called me in.
April Ludgate,What makes you qualified for animal control?
April Ludgate,Did you keep the toilet paper?
April Ludgate,Andy?
April Ludgate,There is no appeals process.
April Ludgate,Can I be the best man?
April Ludgate,You want me to shut that down?
April Ludgate,"So, um, Andy told me what's going on."
April Ludgate,"Hey, you!"
April Ludgate,"Spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini, ravioli, Ferrari, Lamborghini, bucatini, lasagna."
April Ludgate,"I hope you're happy, stupid people in this stupid town!"
April Ludgate,I drove a riding lawn mower through a Nordstrom! There's video that I took! It's on the Internet.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I don't think that's gonna blow their socks off."
April Ludgate,We had to throw our menus away because they are covered with pictures of Larry's dog rectum.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I heard that Neko Case and Ben Gibbard made out here once."
April Ludgate,I'm trying to get these annoying dumdums to pay more money for your cabin.
April Ludgate,God!
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,"Like, how did they know who you are?"
April Ludgate,Good.
April Ludgate,I found a justice guy.
April Ludgate,"You owe it to yourself to give it a real shot, because you are smart and talented."
April Ludgate,You worked really hard.
April Ludgate,These are the marrying people.
April Ludgate,"I just called a bunch of reviewers, and I told them that the soft opening went great, and I invited them to come here on Friday."
April Ludgate,You are not quitting.
April Ludgate,I heard that Dave Eggers wrote a short story about this tape cassette that he found under that tree over there.
April Ludgate,This is Carl.
April Ludgate,Is it weird that my feelings are hurt that no one's found any dirt on me yet? Hello!
April Ludgate,"Yes, I do, I care about Andy And champion."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Today we have spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini, ravioli, rigatoni, bucatini, lasagna."
April Ludgate,"Hello, welcome to Tommy's Bistro."
April Ludgate,You are so lucky.
April Ludgate,"Well, if you ever need to talk to anyone, I'm here for you."
April Ludgate,"Or, like, you know, I'm here, standing near you."
April Ludgate,"Wait, wait, wait."
April Ludgate,Ron isn't here.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"So you're not, like, dying?"
April Ludgate,"Well, tell it to the bank, Lenny."
April Ludgate,What's your question?
April Ludgate,That's what made me start to hate him.
April Ludgate,"What are you going to do with the money, Tom?"
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,I think she's crying in that one.
April Ludgate,Look at this one.
April Ludgate,Are you breaking up with me?
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,One.
April Ludgate,Nothing.
April Ludgate,Distract the guard so the Hamburglar can make his escape.
April Ludgate,That sounds right.
April Ludgate,"So, you talk for one second?"
April Ludgate,Good.
April Ludgate,"Ron, you have to help me."
April Ludgate,How did you make this so fast?
April Ludgate,You're leaving tonight?
April Ludgate,Because he doesn't like you.
April Ludgate,"""For some people, I guess that's being an astronaut or a hot dog-eating champion."""
April Ludgate,"Help me, Agent Macklin, help me!"
April Ludgate,"""There is something wonderful about seeing someone who has found her true purpose on earth."""
April Ludgate,What if I'm a murderer?
April Ludgate,You're right.
April Ludgate,Sure you wanna leave me here with her?
April Ludgate,"No, I don't want the job."
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate Kevorkian.
April Ludgate,I'll just have them pay for yours too.
April Ludgate,He asked me to tell anyone who comes in that he wishes to remain undisturbed so as to better clarify his head space.
April Ludgate,You're a cat.
April Ludgate,You can have your mud and blood back.
April Ludgate,So don't take it.
April Ludgate,You're temperamental.
April Ludgate,You have no legal claim to it.
April Ludgate,it's Alf.
April Ludgate,"Larry, this is part of a real estate transaction now."
April Ludgate,"I'll never guess what kind of dog you are, because you're not a dog."
April Ludgate,"And you love Canada? No, that's not right."
April Ludgate,"Chris? Sorry, he's meditating."
April Ludgate,My God.
April Ludgate,Thank you very much for your time.
April Ludgate,I will have your answer shortly.
April Ludgate,"""For Leslie, her true purpose on earth, her true meaning, is making people's lives better."""
April Ludgate,No idea.
April Ludgate,My mom's Puerto Rican.
April Ludgate,"Well, I thought outside of the box, and I nominated you for this big award."
April Ludgate,I will handle everything.
April Ludgate,That's why I'm so lively and colorful.
April Ludgate,My parents pay for my classes.
April Ludgate,I don't like lotion.
April Ludgate,"Also, he's not into you sexually."
April Ludgate,So I would tell him that.
April Ludgate,I actually care whether you're having a good time and are happy.
April Ludgate,It's weird.
April Ludgate,"Which, if you ask me, is a fireable offense."
April Ludgate,Actually it's because I didn't call you deliberately.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"It's called ""The International Coalition of Women in Government,"" and you won."
April Ludgate,"There's, like, five winners, and you get a big trophy or something."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I've been working on this for three hours, and I know your spirit dog."
April Ludgate,"You are a Nova Scotia toller, because you're outgoing and adventurous."
April Ludgate,"You're unpredictable, complex, and hard to read."
April Ludgate,What are you doing here?
April Ludgate,I work for your boyfriend.
April Ludgate,You make people work before you let them in.
April Ludgate,What is that over there?
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,"8 dollars, a bunch of loose cough drops, and Larry's asthma inhaler."
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,"Look, I'll just write down an itinerary for you, so you can just focus on songs."
April Ludgate,What'd you just say to me?
April Ludgate,Batman.
April Ludgate,What is that?
April Ludgate,I will give you everything in my purse.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, we're not even close to being ready."
April Ludgate,They're not even done painting that sign.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,It looks like everything is falling into place for you.
April Ludgate,Please get back to work.
April Ludgate,Here's my offer.
April Ludgate,"""Don't tell secret""?"
April Ludgate,That's great.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Just sit down somewhere and stop bothering me.
April Ludgate,We should give it back.
April Ludgate,"All right, enough chitchat, everyone."
April Ludgate,A lamppost?
April Ludgate,"And I told your brother, LeVondrious, that he is not welcome."
April Ludgate,"Is that historic, do you think?"
April Ludgate,Weird how?
April Ludgate,"But if they put the time in and prove that they care, then you open yourself up to them."
April Ludgate,"Ow, it's hot."
April Ludgate,"Right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
April Ludgate,I've got a jar of olives.
April Ludgate,Can you get me out of it?
April Ludgate,I've actually been thinking about that a lot lately.
April Ludgate,You guys are closing this sucker down!
April Ludgate,He is just the best ever.
April Ludgate,"Good evening, sir."
April Ludgate,Chris is making me do some stupid management training leadership course.
April Ludgate,A thing of toothpicks that look like swords.
April Ludgate,And a year's supply of toilet paper.
April Ludgate,You miss the band?
April Ludgate,I just wanted you to know we're about to be arrested.
April Ludgate,"Andy, you already have three Johnny Karate shows tomorrow."
April Ludgate,"Okay, well, before you go, I have something for you."
April Ludgate,180 dollars.
April Ludgate,"Even if I wanted the job, I don't want to do the stupid confirmation hearing, okay?"
April Ludgate,Stupid councilmen asking me stupid questions about my stupid life it seems stupid.
April Ludgate,Me neither.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, who is that?"
April Ludgate,"Okay, we need a better system."
April Ludgate,Excellent.
April Ludgate,I didn't know.
April Ludgate,"""That's what I love about her, and that's why she deserves this award."""
April Ludgate,"Shut up, Ann."
April Ludgate,I told you never to talk to me.
April Ludgate,I'm at Johnny's place in Venezuela.
April Ludgate,Next.
April Ludgate,There's a lot of guys with guns here.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,That was Champion.
April Ludgate,"It's better than my mom's house, I guess."
April Ludgate,"Hey, guys."
April Ludgate,"No, I told you not to."
April Ludgate,"So, tell Leslie I don't know when I'm gonna be back."
April Ludgate,No! I told you not to. Stay away!
April Ludgate,"And Millicent is Jerry's daughter, so two bullets."
April Ludgate,"No, we cannot listen to Bobby McFerrin for 60 hours of driving, we'll murder each other."
April Ludgate,Tu entierres en tu trabajo porque tu eres enfeliz en tu vida personal.
April Ludgate,"I think you should lose the first line and the last line and all of the other lines, and instead, just walk up to the mic and meow really loudly for eight minutes."
April Ludgate,"Wow, this is really sad."
April Ludgate,Ethel Beavers did it!
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,"Ron, can you please tell Andy"
April Ludgate,"Oh, and Donna's here."
April Ludgate,And this is only his guesthouse.
April Ludgate,"Secondly, Ann is kind of lame, so way to dodge a bullet."
April Ludgate,Mm-hmm.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Stay still.
April Ludgate,"Well, it would be nice if you helped a little."
April Ludgate,We did it!
April Ludgate,"""Sincerely Satan."""
April Ludgate,"Because, unlike you, Andy and I have jobs."
April Ludgate,And you're not alone.
April Ludgate,I have something.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Best prank ever.
April Ludgate,"Uh, the map says 30 hours but I drive really fast."
April Ludgate,Stop.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Ben, that was amazing."
April Ludgate,I mean it.
April Ludgate,"Plus, the best part, all the buildings come pre-graffitied."
April Ludgate,He has like five million rooms.
April Ludgate,That's true.
April Ludgate,"Like, a house or, like, a condo or something."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,You got blood all over me.
April Ludgate,It's because I'm half wolf.
April Ludgate,"It's okay, I guess."
April Ludgate,Looking at me like a crazy person.
April Ludgate,I can't hear myself not talking to Andy.
April Ludgate,I don't know why Leslie Knope's on trial.
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
April Ludgate,"Yes, I want to figure out your spirit dog, and I'm going to do that by learning everything there is to know about you."
April Ludgate,So take it.
April Ludgate,"Okay, what's your favorite color?"
April Ludgate,He would like to register for Women's studies.
April Ludgate,They are very happy.
April Ludgate,Favorite music?
April Ludgate,Favorite book?
April Ludgate,You've got lots of friends.
April Ludgate,That's not a
April Ludgate,"Jerry, can you please be quiet?"
April Ludgate,Facebook.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Facebook.
April Ludgate,I like my hands to be cracked and calloused like a railway worker.
April Ludgate,"Um, describe your perfect Sunday."
April Ludgate,Ew.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,And they're all set with their welcome bags.
April Ludgate,"Congrats, babe."
April Ludgate,Favorite movies?
April Ludgate,They say Hugo Chavez will love this video because it is another success for their committee.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I can't do this anymore.
April Ludgate,Facebook.
April Ludgate,And Andy and Ben have been helping me look into different jobs to figure out what I really want to do.
April Ludgate,Bad dog!
April Ludgate,"Yes, everything's fine with the rental."
April Ludgate,"And now, I'm here."
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,What's going on?
April Ludgate,So take it.
April Ludgate,"He's stolen my jewels, and now he's going to ravish my body and he stinks, he really stinks!"
April Ludgate,"I just fell backwards into your world, and years have gone by."
April Ludgate,Or government.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"Because honestly, I don't even know if I like working in National Parks."
April Ludgate,Say the line.
April Ludgate,I got the Red Hot Chili Peppers to send us a signed guitar.
April Ludgate,So don't take it.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,They're a Committee to Humiliate and Shame America.
April Ludgate,"Okay, first of all, dark places are awesome."
April Ludgate,I quit.
April Ludgate,I don't want to work in government.
April Ludgate,Nothing.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,I love her.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I just had to physically separate two 80 year old men who were arguing about whether it was really Lena Horne in that grocery store in 1970."
April Ludgate,Please sit.
April Ludgate,Yes!
April Ludgate,Burn.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,This is intense.
April Ludgate,That story's awesome!
April Ludgate,That's a genius move.
April Ludgate,One kid peed his pants because he didn't want to miss anything.
April Ludgate,"Babe, I am so glad you didn't tell me."
April Ludgate,"Hey, status report?"
April Ludgate,Can't believe I'm marrying him.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
April Ludgate,That's why it's stupid to work hard.
April Ludgate,You like this little guy?
April Ludgate,"I'm trying to find a way to be annoyed by it, but Coming up empty."
April Ludgate,"I wasn't listening, but I strongly disagree with Ann."
April Ludgate,"You're welcome, Lester."
April Ludgate,So you're from Mongolia?
April Ludgate,I don't care what Ben says.
April Ludgate,Then I'm gonna marry him again.
April Ludgate,I'm not here.
April Ludgate,Such a loser.
April Ludgate,Okay?
April Ludgate,You what?
April Ludgate,Jerry!
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
April Ludgate,I love you.
April Ludgate,"""They let the world wash over them and barely notice anyone else is even there."""
April Ludgate,What's wrong?
April Ludgate,Chris wants you in his office for the final round of interviews.
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,Will you take me with you when you go back there?
April Ludgate,Trying to see who has the least amount of dirt on them in case someone wants to run for office.
April Ludgate,"Donna, did you put the info sheets on all the cages?"
April Ludgate,That was the best performance ever.
April Ludgate,"Babe, that was so awesome."
April Ludgate,And sorry we goofed around so much.
April Ludgate,I love you.
April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking, ""what if we did ""something like this?"
April Ludgate,Next month in London.
April Ludgate,I have an idea.
April Ludgate,Swear on my great-great-grandmother's grave I'm not here.
April Ludgate,Can you just leave me alone?
April Ludgate,"""Leslie Knope is not one of these people."""
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,He's right here in my pocket.
April Ludgate,"Oh, okay."
April Ludgate,Wow!
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry."
April Ludgate,Did you bring any wolverines?
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,A friend.
April Ludgate,"I'm great, see."
April Ludgate,"Um, I don't know."
April Ludgate,"Is there really going to be a weird, new person in the office?"
April Ludgate,I feel so relaxed.
April Ludgate,Leslie?
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,All the animal are uptodate on their shots.
April Ludgate,Maybe because I worked so hard on that dumb pet adoption and I failed.
April Ludgate,"""I don't know how she does it."""
April Ludgate,That's amazing.
April Ludgate,"""Dear award committee members"" Leslie, I didn't even start."
April Ludgate,"""She cares about everything and everyone in our town."""
April Ludgate,Get out.
April Ludgate,Mmhmm.
April Ludgate,That's why we're all playing.
April Ludgate,"Ah, stop!"
April Ludgate,I'm going to.
April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking about changing the font on the itineraries. What do you think?"
April Ludgate,How about you only say that never?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,And then I'm gonna divorce him.
April Ludgate,I will hold myself in contempt of the court!
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I awesome sauce Andy.
April Ludgate,What's up with these shirts?
April Ludgate,"So I'm gonna read this letter to you, out loud, but if you hug me afterwards, I swear to God, I'll scream and pull my hair out and maybe punch you in the face."
April Ludgate,You get twice the secrets.
April Ludgate,Andy's great.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,I'm all set.
April Ludgate,And it's where I'd bury the bodies of that annoying couple after I murder them.
April Ludgate,"""She spends every waking moment thinking of new ways to make her friends happy."""
April Ludgate,"Actually, no, that's good."
April Ludgate,I'm not mad at Andy.
April Ludgate,I'd go up there and take Andy and Champion and just get away from everyone else and look at spiders.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, an empty Sprite can, an old man's fingernail in my pocket, and a picture of Patrick Ewing on a roller coaster."
April Ludgate,I love games that turn people against each other.
April Ludgate,I forgot about the toe!
April Ludgate,"Jerry, the puppies are going to the bathroom everywhere."
April Ludgate,I'll buy it.
April Ludgate,We're ready.
April Ludgate,I love you.
April Ludgate,No.

April Ludgate,Did the bone show?
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,101 million.
April Ludgate,You're fired.
April Ludgate,"Andy, if you have a secret, you have to tell me."
April Ludgate,Fountains.
April Ludgate,That's the whole point of marriage.
April Ludgate,See?
April Ludgate,"Nothing, Chris."
April Ludgate,"Oh, really?"
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,Dark Lord rise--
April Ludgate,I failed.
April Ludgate,In hell fire.
April Ludgate,Was there a lot of blood?
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"I feel like you're getting sad about how stupid and lame people are, and that is my job, not yours."
April Ludgate,"I need you to continuously clean out the cages, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Andy and I can babysit anytime, except for on weekends and nights, but we're free anytime during work hours."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Babe.
April Ludgate,"""People come to her with the pettiest, stupidest problems, and she cares-- like, really, actually cares-- what happens to them."""
April Ludgate,I'm not going to tell Leslie I'm leaving my job on this trip.
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,"So thank you, and I love you, but, no, thank you, and I hate you."
April Ludgate,"Pawnee is cheap, and we like it here, and Chicago seems like there's a lot of stuff to do and people, but I like to do nothing with no one."
April Ludgate,"We are not moving to Chicago for, like, a billion reasons."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,She'll drown me in the Potomac while she recites facts about the Potomac.
April Ludgate,I wish you were coming with me.
April Ludgate,How can I tell her I'm leaving when I don't even know what job I want?
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,And I think he likes you.
April Ludgate,"Thank you, but yeah, it's real."
April Ludgate,We can't let people see that.
April Ludgate,"Ann Richards won it once, and Janet Napolitano, I think."
April Ludgate,"""And if you're lucky enough to be her friend, your life gets better every day."""
April Ludgate,You guys know why there are all those cops out there?
April Ludgate,"Shouldn't you be working at your new company, Tom?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Did you understand that?
April Ludgate,Can't I just stay in the back and spit in people's food like we planned?
April Ludgate,"Okay, you stay on the Key Largo and Denver Meagles, and I will handle the Berlin Meagles."
April Ludgate,There's pizza in Pawnee.
Artist,Tell me about yourself.
Artist,"I don't know what you mean by ""good."""

August Clementine,For your thoughts.
August Clementine,"I believe that is the Eagleton Pawnee merger, n'estce pas?"
August Clementine,"And I'm your Eagletonian host, August Clementine."
August Clementine,This twerp has a name.
August Clementine,And I talked last.
August Clementine,Good day.
August Clementine,"Ms. Knope, I understand you're here today to try to convince us that this disastrous merger of our two towns was, in any way, a good idea."
August Clementine,I said it.

Bank Teller,I just handed it to you.
Barbara Boxer,"So, Leslie, what do you do?"
Barbara Boxer,"Well, you know, if it's good with Leslie, it's good with me."
Barbara Boxer,"Well, so, Leslie, what do you think?"
Barbara Boxer,"Sounds great, but I do have an appointment with the President."
Barbara Boxer,Yeah.
Barbara Boxer,"Ben, I remember you from the Kennedy Center."
Barbara Boxer,Is this the right move?
Barney,The advantage of QuickBooks Pro is that it's easy to assemble a list of vendors--
Barney,"When it comes to choosing accounting software, there's no accounting for taste."
Barney,Though I could make an exception for someone else.
Barney,"I was gonna wait until your birthday to give this to you, but I'm just too excited."
Barney,"I'm sorry, but we're not really taking any more applicants."
Barney,I demand an evaluation.
Barney,I knew it was too good to be true.
Barney,I see.
Barney,The demonstration takes another 45 minutes.
Barney,Say it to Ted when he comes in.
Barney,Come in here!
Barney,Ted!
Barney,Come work for us at the accounting firm.
Barney,"Hi, Ben."
Barney,Oh! Oh!
Barney,Wow.
Barney,Shortest one yet.
Barney,"Ben, that was amazing."
Barney,"After you gave it to us as a gift, we saw its potential, so we formed a ""C"" corp and registered it in your name."
Barney,But it's too late for her to apply.
Barney,"You know what? If her friends are trying this hard, there must be something amazing about her."
Barney,Ben!
Barney,Yes!
Barney,You just cracked the case.
Barney,Ted!
Barney,ohh! Is this a classic Ben joke?
Barney,I just can't believe it's finally happening.
Barney,What
Barney,And that concludes a quick look at QuickBooks Pro.
Barney,"It's me, Barney, from the accounting firm."
Barney,Enjoy.
Barney,You don't have any accounting experience?
Barney,"So, please, if there's anything we can do to make you happier in your new job, just let me know."
Barney,Ben Wyatt.
Barney,"Financial analysis, automated general ledger accounting systems, audit management."
Barney,The only thing that's taxing is deciding which software to buy.
Barney,He's here!
Barney,Let's play.
Barney,"Hmm, you've done everything."
Barney,Sorry.
Barney,When it comes to preparing taxesâ¦
Barney,Tell her I'll meet with her tomorrow--
Barney,They should.
Barney,"Well, look, I think you'd be a great addition."
Barney,Would you be willing to come back to meet the division head?
Barney,"Hey, Sharon!"
Barney,No need to explain.
Barney,"As you can see through the window, you have a great view of the billing department."
Barney,This is our best office.
Barney,We'll set that up.
Barney,"I know you changed your mind the last time we offered you a job, but we are just thrilled that you changed it again."
Barney,"We do not get a lot of humor here, and when we do, it's wonderful."
Barney,She's fun.
Barney,"Miss Knope, I understand that you're currently evaluating the rec center teachers."
Barney,He really came!
Barney,"I'm just kidding, you can do whatever you want."
Barney,Saturday at the firm with Ben.
Barney,"Well, what did she major in?"
Barney,"Hi, Ben."
Barney,Economics?
Barney,Accounting?
Barney,Ben is here.
Barney,"So, consultants aren't exactly well liked."
Barney,My car.
Barney,"Um, the, uh, temp agency said that you are fluent with Quickbooks Pro, correct?"
Barney,I hope you don't mind.
Barney,You're fired!
Barney,"Sorry to start you out like this, and on a Friday no less."
Barney,But it's our toughest case.
Barney,"Three competing family trusts, a contested will-- it's a real puzzler!"
Barney,We decided to throw you a pizza party to say congrats for cracking the case.
Barney,"Wyatt, you're late."
Barney,I will just show to your cubicle.
Barney,"Well, it's really about finding creative solutions to difficult problems."
Barney,This is disappointing.
Barney,"Say it again but this time I'm gonna turn the light on, like you just had an idea."
Barney,Again.
Barney,"Ben, Ben."
Barney,You've got to hear this.
Barney,Ben!
Barney,"Now, a lot of times, there's firing."
Barney,"Welcome, Mr. Saperstein."
Barney,"Oh, oh!"
Barney,Maybe someday we'll figure out the magic formula that gets you to work here.
Barney,Ben is here!
Barney,Ted!
Barney,"""You can play with one warrior, but it's just not nearly as good."""
Barney,We know!
Barney,"Ted, get in here! Ben's quitting again, but you gotta hear what he said."
Bartender,"Yeah, he goes on in a second."
Bartender,Wow.
Bartender,This one is on us.
Bartender,"Hey, we're closing up."
Bartender,"Well, if you want, I could teach you the secret to great--"
Bartender,Thank you.
Ben,What's he talking about?
Ben,What?
Ben,See you.
Ben,Hi.
Ben,"Wanna play some Hacky Sack later, maybe listen to Blues Traveler?"
Ben,Wings and brews!
Ben,"Totes, bro."
Ben,No.
Ben,Thanks.
Ben,"But you did, and it was awesome."
Ben,Yeah.
Ben,That sounds amazing.
Ben,Pass.
Ben,"Grandpa, leave me alone."
Ben,Computers.
Ben,You smell like death.
Ben,Fine.
Ben,"Leslie, you are looking hot."
Ben,What are you talking about? He's incredible.
Ben,Can we come?
Ben,"Yeah, it'll be like The Golden Girls."
Ben,"Yeah, I would understand."
Ben,"He's amazing, right, April?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,What what are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,"This is a town budget, not a bottomless trust fund."
Ben Wyatt,Gayle you're Gayle?
Ben Wyatt,You-- You know what I like?
Ben Wyatt,I think that that's reasonable.
Ben Wyatt,Jerry's beautiful wife Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Seriously?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, either you get fired, the Parks budget shrinks, or the animal shelter's gotta go."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, there is nowhere else."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna give my blessing for you to go and try and win my girlfriend away from me."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, how about some calzones?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't think that's a word.
Ben Wyatt,Little road trip?
Ben Wyatt,I could see to it that you never rent another tent in this region again.
Ben Wyatt,We found a glaring number of code violations you've committed.
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, Harvey."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, man."
Ben Wyatt,I was in the zone today.
Ben Wyatt,You just unplug the router and then you plug it back in again.
Ben Wyatt,This really has been a lot of fun.
Ben Wyatt,The old juice is back!
Ben Wyatt,It could turn into a scandal.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, I've told you how to do it."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, should we keep this going?"
Ben Wyatt,He's been doing all the paperwork for this deal.
Ben Wyatt,He deserves to come.
Ben Wyatt,Larry isn't that bad.
Ben Wyatt,"Celebratory dinner, just like the old days?"
Ben Wyatt,He's nice.
Ben Wyatt,"And frankly, I don't care who knows that I said that, as long as no one knows that I said that."
Ben Wyatt,"She doesn't feel the same way, because she has a boyfriend um, me, and and and and we love each other."
Ben Wyatt,Me?
Ben Wyatt,Okay? Money doesn't just appear out of nowhere.
Ben Wyatt,Who looks like that.
Ben Wyatt,You don't feel like your body is in decay or death is inevitable?
Ben Wyatt,"You know, if you die and you don't have a real will, most of what you own will go to the government."
Ben Wyatt,"But my wife is receiving an award in just a few minutes, and I really need to get over there."
Ben Wyatt,"""Upon my death, all of my belongings shall transfer to the man or animal who has killed me."""
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Ben Wyatt,Guys
Ben Wyatt,It's a complicated legal document.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,You mind signing it?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,"So, Leslie and I just finished putting together our will, and she wants you to be the witness."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's probably true."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"But, you know Cool."
Ben Wyatt,Trucks and stuff.
Ben Wyatt,Are you serious?
Ben Wyatt,I get a little nervous with cops.
Ben Wyatt,I am pretty sure you shouldn't have a weapon at work.
Ben Wyatt,I was getting somewhere with that.
Ben Wyatt,What are these weird symbols?
Ben Wyatt,Are you serious?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you should really have a will that's more than one sentence long."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you don't even know where we're going yet."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, you're okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Ron's girlfriend's pretty.
Ben Wyatt,It's not even notarized.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Harvey."
Ben Wyatt,Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,We spoke on the phone.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, that document is nothing."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,It could hurt your campaign.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, how would you imagine we do this?"
Ben Wyatt,It's a lot thicker than the original one page version.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Eddie if you'd like me to talk more about the program, I would be happy to"
Ben Wyatt,I could introduce you to our lawyer.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I think we're gonna need to take a look at this."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,You have a wife and kids now.
Ben Wyatt,What am I doing?
Ben Wyatt,I really don't think it matters.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Larry."
Ben Wyatt,The slogan?
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, actually, Dave, I'd like to talk to you."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you passed the test."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I want to talk to you, and if not, then I'd like to talk to Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"I've been talking to Ron about estate planning, and he is here to do some ""Good Will Hunting."""
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Trevor."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I got this pack of socks."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously, accountants are a little more bad boy, but, uh, there's a respect there."
Ben Wyatt,Hm.
Ben Wyatt,You're right.
Ben Wyatt,We speak the same language.
Ben Wyatt,"And Larry, he's the guy that brought you down, and he's gonna be watching you like a hawk."
Ben Wyatt,"We're going to let you continue renting tents, and you're going to do it at a fair price."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I love you, very much."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,But this is the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Ben Wyatt,Which we all know you are.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, that comment wasn't really about whether you're good at bowling"
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Pawnee is a really special town."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thanks."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, guys, we don't have to play this game if you don't want to."
Ben Wyatt,You wanna bounce some ideas off each other?
Ben Wyatt,Unintentional.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,This is Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,You fixed the mistakes.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, sir, I will."
Ben Wyatt,The object is be the first to build a civilization on this fictional island.
Ben Wyatt,"Where there's a ""Will,"" there's a way."
Ben Wyatt,The game is Settlers of Catan.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, come on, Trevor."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, my accountant friends seem to enjoy 'em."
Ben Wyatt,Then I'm sure you are okay with the fact that they installed the sign the wrong way and it's welcoming you to Pawnee as you're leaving.
Ben Wyatt,"Because he has to draw up a new will, so"
Ben Wyatt,See? People vote with their gut.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you wanna come with us to tent world?"
Ben Wyatt,You'd be amazing.
Ben Wyatt,"And everyone's gonna be in awe of how amazing you are, so just shut your month."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I can talk about Sandra Bullock skirt length."
Ben Wyatt,So Perd Hapley wants to do Thursday now.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, let's do that instead."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,That could actually work.
Ben Wyatt,This is ridiculous.
Ben Wyatt,Should we throw in some salads for a healthy option?
Ben Wyatt,"No, I don't think I believe you."
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, give it a minute."
Ben Wyatt,Is there anyone I can ask?
Ben Wyatt,Guess I'll do it.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Calzones.
Ben Wyatt,Pretty straightforward deal.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"I know your female friends are very important to you, but I'm always a good sounding board."
Ben Wyatt,The compromise is that you're gonna sign the deal we originally agreed upon.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,The public needs to see that.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,The Gergiches really go all out.
Ben Wyatt,Tom.
Ben Wyatt,This is incredible.
Ben Wyatt,"Remain calm, but I think you just drank some of the regular, full fat eggnog."
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, one cup won't kill you."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Chris everybody knows that."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he's a lawyer, I'm an accountant."
Ben Wyatt,But some people have the impression that you're a little elitist or intellectual or something.
Ben Wyatt,"See, a lot of people don't vote with their brains."
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, babe, you've gone crazy."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, just let me do the talking here, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, then, no, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,They vote with their guts.
Ben Wyatt,"I know you're fun, and you can have a good time."
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,Is this really necessary?
Ben Wyatt,Wildly inappropriate.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll adjust."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, not too many."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,That makes me kind of sad.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I wanted to sneak in before you got here an absurd pipe dream I now realize was impossible."
Ben Wyatt,Your hearing doesn't start for another two hours.
Ben Wyatt,It's 6:30 in the morning.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, thanks, Larry, that's nice of you."
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
Ben Wyatt,How is Gayle?
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
Ben Wyatt,And the girls?
Ben Wyatt,I'm genuinely interested.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, uh, we were just--"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it was loud."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I had him made for you at the toy store."
Ben Wyatt,Hey So Gayle and Jerry I've thought about it a lot.
Ben Wyatt,For what?
Ben Wyatt,Ooh!
Ben Wyatt,We have come a long way.
Ben Wyatt,Let me resign.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I hate to nag, but shouldn't we be talking strategy, like, when to ask the chief for this huge critical favor?"
Ben Wyatt,Here's a place that might work.
Ben Wyatt,But also incredibly happy for you and Ann.
Ben Wyatt,So how'd it go? You okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hang on."
Ben Wyatt,"It's a very, very special place."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,"Morning, Jessica."
Ben Wyatt,They take pride in their work.
Ben Wyatt,They love their city.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
Ben Wyatt,You're welcome.
Ben Wyatt,Thank me?
Ben Wyatt,But you were a fine surrogate before we found them.
Ben Wyatt,It's called Sweaty Roger's Pants Tent.
Ben Wyatt,It's the only thing that truly protects you.
Ben Wyatt,It's a good thing.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I forgot that this part of being accounting bros was actually pretty depressing."
Ben Wyatt,I told you we'd feel better.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna I'm gonna treat myself.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I really needed this.
Ben Wyatt,"Now when you take questions, I think you should be brief and sincere."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, after the intense, almost meth-like high of solving accounting puzzles, we were always just beat at the end of the day."
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure that you don't need more whipped cream?
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna treat myself.
Ben Wyatt,"Just apologize again, and stay on script."
Ben Wyatt,Don't try to justify what I did.
Ben Wyatt,The advantage is that it's a wonderful city.
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"So, yeah, the pizza's dynamite, isn't it?"
Ben Wyatt,How's your salad?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look, I've been to fourty some odd towns in Indiana and Pawnee is special."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the people are passionate and kind."
Ben Wyatt,Let's get outta here.
Ben Wyatt,That's fair.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I'd re-watch Twin Peaks, then hit the Twin Peaks message boards and read The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer to find Easter Eggs I'd missed."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,"What, you're charging us for coffee?"
Ben Wyatt,What kind of a business... Uh-oh.
Ben Wyatt,Gotta be kidding me.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so you've thought this through."
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna do that.
Ben Wyatt,You own this place too?
Ben Wyatt,I'm more of a behind the scenes kind of guy.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we're not giving in to your crazy demands."
Ben Wyatt,There are plenty of other tent rental places within driving distance.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you'd exercise."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Chris recommended a place.
Ben Wyatt,Those are my pens and pencils.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, you can't rent tents there."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, listen."
Ben Wyatt,I'm actually glad you're here.
Ben Wyatt,"After this project finishes, I'm gonna focus on other departments and cut down my time with Parks and Rec."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should fight back.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I have you down only four points, but they're running a ton of new negative ads."
Ben Wyatt,"I have to pee really bad, ironically."
Ben Wyatt,Yup.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this contract is insane."
Ben Wyatt,And what's a flap tax?
Ben Wyatt,I guess I'm not totally over it.
Ben Wyatt,I just I haven't had to deal with that mayor stuff for 17 years.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,A discussion surcharge?
Ben Wyatt,That's nuts.
Ben Wyatt,That's it.
Ben Wyatt,It costs extra to have people inside the tents?
Ben Wyatt,"No, you did it."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all right."
Ben Wyatt,"That speech was a little rough, don't you think?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, when this thing's over, do you wanna grab some dinner?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, which one's Sugarbutt?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,We're very sorry for the position this puts you in.
Ben Wyatt,There are a lot of cars.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, that actually may be tough."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, my wife is in the middle of this recall fight, and I really need to"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you're looking at a picture of Millie."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"You want to take off, grab some vegan fries?"
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,I'll fill you in later.
Ben Wyatt,Are you ready for your speech?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, maybe going to therapy 1000 times a week is helping. I mean, if you'd seen that picture a month ago, you would have fallen apart."
Ben Wyatt,Deal's off.
Ben Wyatt,Could be.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Chris says congratulations and that together we're unstoppable."
Ben Wyatt,We'll take our business elsewhere.
Ben Wyatt,I hope he's okay.
Ben Wyatt,"So, if you miss me, you just look at this Wrinkled, hideous monster and you'll know I'm sitting there rooting for you, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, look, I'll be outside all day, right on the other side of that wall."
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry about me.
Ben Wyatt,I know it is.
Ben Wyatt,"You're just gonna get a slap on the wrist, maybe a brief suspension."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, it's going to be okay."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,"After The Smallest Park wraps up, I am going to ask Chris to take over all Parks and Rec business."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,So Andy's gonna stay there for three months.
Ben Wyatt,"Larry, this is great stuff."
Ben Wyatt,""" Okay, one more time."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,He owns two.
Ben Wyatt,Ice Town.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,He sent me an email this morning.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I was the one who didn't want to go.
Ben Wyatt,"The funny... When I guess... The fortunate... Can we just, sort of..."
Ben Wyatt,"No, we're going to Trumple's thing."
Ben Wyatt,Then I'll just see you tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, look, I mean, we tried hanging out together, we tried working together, and it just Bums me out."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, pretty recently."
Ben Wyatt,"I was seeing a woman, uh, for a while, and then we stopped seeing each other."
Ben Wyatt,And when you-- You end up getting out there and there's a--
Ben Wyatt,I was a kid.
Ben Wyatt,That must have taken awhile.
Ben Wyatt,So I just wanted to stop by and--
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot."
Ben Wyatt,"You don't care about the endorsement? Leslie, let's not let your terrible decision making get in the way of this election."
Ben Wyatt,I guess he got on the wrong train on the way to work and got lost.
Ben Wyatt,"No, Leslie, no, listen to me."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry to bother you.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you know what? I need to say something."
Ben Wyatt,"This park is just gonna be a quiet patch of grass, harming nobody."
Ben Wyatt,I was just saying to Ron that my dog's Jewish.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Phone water.
Ben Wyatt,I I don't work here.
Ben Wyatt,Everybody cool?
Ben Wyatt,You did.
Ben Wyatt,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,It's dead.
Ben Wyatt,And that's a dog biscuit.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Leslie sounded weird."
Ben Wyatt,I don't want to wait for Tom.
Ben Wyatt,I want to walk home.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm sorry."
Ben Wyatt,Home is that way.
Ben Wyatt,Watch out for that fence.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"This late in the game, it's killer."
Ben Wyatt,Blueberries
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, in response to your complaints, we are cancelling all of these disruptive events."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this isn't really in the spirit of what we're trying to do."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, we are out of time."
Ben Wyatt,My parents make me so mad sometimes.
Ben Wyatt,"Just like the time they couldn't decide who gets the dog, so they just dropped it off at the local synagogue."
Ben Wyatt,I ran five k this morning.
Ben Wyatt,"I was, like, ""Say what?"""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, my teeth are blue."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Hold that thought.
Ben Wyatt,Just for a sec.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, honey."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, everybody, listen up."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I threw up in the shower."
Ben Wyatt,It's Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,Knope.
Ben Wyatt,"Hold on, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,We have to go back to them.
Ben Wyatt,Not at all.
Ben Wyatt,We are so [bleep] screwed.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"So, doctor, um, what do we like, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Realistically, I'm guessing we dropped three to five points in the polls."
Ben Wyatt,"That was not the favor we needed to ask for, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just gonna help them out, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"If we don't get the police for the Harvest Festival, there is no Harvest Festival."
Ben Wyatt,This is insane.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, how do we how how how how what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,Just one second.
Ben Wyatt,I don't think that's a great idea.
Ben Wyatt,"No, you didn't."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Shauna."
Ben Wyatt,Your song is Dancing on the Ceiling by Lionel Richie?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,But is that really news?
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I don't, uh I'm I'm just Wait."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks a lot, bro."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I will be there in two flaps of a butterfly's wing, and I love you."
Ben Wyatt,And Saperstein wants us to relax?
Ben Wyatt,I think I heard the computer laugh at me.
Ben Wyatt,I've just honestly never met someone who works as hard as you do.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what we're trying to say is that you are a great guy, and someday, you're gonna meet somebody who's into all the same stuff that you are."
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, Chris, I know you think that we're a dream team"
Ben Wyatt,The numbers got a lot higher.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you're like the Energizer Bunny of city government."
Ben Wyatt,For what?
Ben Wyatt,Just for an hour.
Ben Wyatt,"I just multiplied all our future expenses by three, and you know what happened?"
Ben Wyatt,We will let you know.
Ben Wyatt,Three kids?
Ben Wyatt,This is insane.
Ben Wyatt,"Then our heads will explode, and we will die."
Ben Wyatt,Alright.
Ben Wyatt,"Alright, alright."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm sure you guys can work it out."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,But you're a terrible person to discuss personal problems with.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, you are a wonderful guy, and I admire many things about you."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, they both wanted the house for Columbus Day weekend, and they fought so much, they decided to just sell it to spite each other."
Ben Wyatt,So she-- Okay.
Ben Wyatt,You never have to worry about that.
Ben Wyatt,Can I ask why?
Ben Wyatt,I'm always gonna be on your team.
Ben Wyatt,Just like that?
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"Deep down, I think you feel bad for them."
Ben Wyatt,And the recovery will take years.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you for that year over year maintenance cost analysis.
Ben Wyatt,"People are gonna lose their jobs, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,We need the Pawnee police force to volunteer as security during the upcoming Harvest Festival.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"Butch Countsidy and the Sumdance Kid, together again."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie Knope asked you for a favor the other day, but the real favor we need is much bigger."
Ben Wyatt,But that's not why I'm here.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the city won't let us throw the festival unless Say no more."
Ben Wyatt,I love this!
Ben Wyatt,That was really helpful.
Ben Wyatt,Are they still dating or--
Ben Wyatt,They'll be
Ben Wyatt,"Are you absolutely sure you wanna go through with this? A lot of people are gonna get angry, and you might lose the recall election."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, one more time."
Ben Wyatt,Why did you throw this at me?
Ben Wyatt,It's the chance you've been waiting for.
Ben Wyatt,'Cause I told you I wanted to read it?
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,She got the perfect puppy for that shot.
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Ben Wyatt,She is good.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we can."
Ben Wyatt,"Tomorrow morning, we are going back to Pillner and telling him to cut the Parks budget."
Ben Wyatt,"Senior citizens are basically the only people who vote in local elections, so if you want to win, you gotta get the gray vote."
Ben Wyatt,This is fine.
Ben Wyatt,Everything's fine.
Ben Wyatt,I'm all good.
Ben Wyatt,"Nope, nope."
Ben Wyatt,"Was it a serious thing, or..."
Ben Wyatt,Then you wouldn't be Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,I don't work here.
Ben Wyatt,Usually you can only get board game tshirts in XXL.
Ben Wyatt,Right?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, good."
Ben Wyatt,Congratulations.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I just wanted to remind you that when you're bowling, try not to fixate on just one pin."
Ben Wyatt,You want to do some tai chi?
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, chief."
Ben Wyatt,You're trying to knock down a lot of pins.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,You have won the award for Best Man.
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you're coming?"
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, Craig."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you've never been married, so you didn't get your own bachelor party."
Ben Wyatt,I think Leslie's doing a great job.
Ben Wyatt,We have to go hire a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie!
Ben Wyatt,I'm so mad at my parents.
Ben Wyatt,I feel great.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, are you doing all right?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Holy hell, that's a lot of alcohol."
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, that's strong."
Ben Wyatt,"I'd like to introduce you to my good friend, anyone else."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you know what we should do for him?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Why wouldn't you run this by me first, Dad?"
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, just weird family business."
Ben Wyatt,"My parents had this small, little vacation house on Lake Hubbard."
Ben Wyatt,"And now, they've sold it without telling the rest of us."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, here's hoping that that nickname doesn't stick."
Ben Wyatt,My dad sent me this check out of the blue.
Ben Wyatt,My share of the profits.
Ben Wyatt,It's so disrespectful to the family structure--
Ben Wyatt,"I wrap myself around her, I soak up all of her stress, and then after the kids are born, someone can squeeze me out into a bucket."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry to interrupt.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I'm just trying to help them."
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie is already the queen of stress, so I have to be like her stress shamwow."
Ben Wyatt,Bababooey.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but you didn't really help them very much, so we volunteered to give them a little financial advice."
Ben Wyatt,"""You know?"""
Ben Wyatt,"I was like, ""God!"""
Ben Wyatt,You guys!
Ben Wyatt,"Just, likeâ¦"
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, I'm not."
Ben Wyatt,'Cause we have to do that thing.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,All I know is Leslie's always talking about how lucky she is to have you as a friend.
Ben Wyatt,"And so, I was like, ""Why?"
Ben Wyatt,And I just wanted you to know that.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing here?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I kinda need you to do it at my speed."
Ben Wyatt,I see where you're going with this.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you're gonna ask me if I like apples"
Ben Wyatt,When did she say... Likes me?
Ben Wyatt,Why don't we put a pin in this?
Ben Wyatt,You spent government money on a TV subscription?
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, hey, you haven't told anyone about the baby, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, technically, we all do."
Ben Wyatt,Can you help?
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should start taking it easy.
Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it also tastes like jelly."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you suck at being polite, sir."
Ben Wyatt,This is worse than I could've imagined.
Ben Wyatt,"My parents, they had this lake house and they sold it without telling me."
Ben Wyatt,Stop pivoting!
Ben Wyatt,Eagleton is on the brink of an epic financial disaster.
Ben Wyatt,"I told you you can pivot, not that you can only pivot."
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Tom Oh, my God!"
Ben Wyatt,This could really only go poorly.
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, I don't know you that well, but you're clearly very important to Leslie"
Ben Wyatt,and that must mean you're a pretty great person.
Ben Wyatt,"They were in financial trouble a few years ago, like Pawnee was, but their government just kept borrowing money."
Ben Wyatt,I know she feels awful.
Ben Wyatt,Their debt to equity ratio is ridonkulous.
Ben Wyatt,You're stressing out for two now.
Ben Wyatt,We need big ticket items.
Ben Wyatt,So what do we got so far?
Ben Wyatt,Damn it.
Ben Wyatt,He's right.
Ben Wyatt,I'm still angry.
Ben Wyatt,I was just checking
Ben Wyatt,Try it again.
Ben Wyatt,Kind of.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know why this lake house thing is driving me so crazy.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron is right, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you for helping me with my anger.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, let's start with the basics."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, why don't you just play some oneonone, see if you can score?"
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, guard him."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you have to create space."
Ben Wyatt,You gotta just dribble around him.
Ben Wyatt,Shoot the ball.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I don't feel any better."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know what my spirit animal is.
Ben Wyatt,I don't wanna do this.
Ben Wyatt,"I've been auditing the budget, and I noticed you're way behind on your paperwork."
Ben Wyatt,Now.
Ben Wyatt,And I want to do it.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I know things are crazy, but there's no good time."
Ben Wyatt,I want to start our family.
Ben Wyatt,"I have so many childhood memories at that lake house that, in the back of my mind, I always pictured taking my kids-- or taking our kids there."
Ben Wyatt,But Ron kind of just showed me the real reason.
Ben Wyatt,This massive expenditure from public works?
Ben Wyatt,Was a bankruptcy brunch the best idea?
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,I thought I was upset because my parents are insane.
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't matter.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,"We just watched this movie two nights ago, so"
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Jerry, you haven't filled out a PC10 form in two and a half years."
Ben Wyatt,What is this here?
Ben Wyatt,"What's your endgame here, my dear?"
Ben Wyatt,I'm just standing here.
Ben Wyatt,"But other Ron, he's not helping me with it."
Ben Wyatt,"Hmm, that's actually a pretty decent tshirt idea."
Ben Wyatt,I have something I'm very angry about.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you need to understand that just to keep this town afloat, we probably have to cut the budget of every department by 40 or 50%."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,The baby has two bodies?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, he said that because that sounds a lot better than ""We're going to gut it with a machete."""
Ben Wyatt,Are you tipping me?
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Dave, go ahead."
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's fine."
Ben Wyatt,This building has feelings?
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Because I didn't cause these problems, Ms. Knope."
Ben Wyatt,"You see, Leslie here is a team of one."
Ben Wyatt,Your government did.
Ben Wyatt,It wasn't a competition.
Ben Wyatt,Can you give me an hour?
Ben Wyatt,I'll get what I need from the spreadsheets.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, if I'd known it didn't go well with the guy from Interior, I"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh you know, I've got a few phone calls to make."
Ben Wyatt,Long distance sucks.
Ben Wyatt,What can you tell me about Jerry Gergich?
Ben Wyatt,Do you have a second?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,So I'd like to talk about where you think there's waste within your department.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, I mean, this is getting weird, but, uh, there it is."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, wow, look at that."
Ben Wyatt,Go ahead.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Shauna's doing a story on our group bachelor party."
Ben Wyatt,She said she wanted to write stories about good people doing nice things for each other.
Ben Wyatt,Go ahead.
Ben Wyatt,Can you come visit next month? We can take a proper tour of the sights.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's start with personnel."
Ben Wyatt,Triplets.
Ben Wyatt,So I figured you two might have a lot to talk about.
Ben Wyatt,You shaved off part of your mustache.
Ben Wyatt,But we're not.
Ben Wyatt,That's lovely.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, definitely."
Ben Wyatt,"And that might be a very good team, but she kind of steamrolls the rest of her team, me, to do whatever she wants."
Ben Wyatt,"Regardless of how the rest of her team, me, feels."
Ben Wyatt,So I don't think we should work together anymore.
Ben Wyatt,"Although, I am just two sandwiches away from a free meatball sub."
Ben Wyatt,"But now, I'm not sure what's keeping me here."
Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?
Ben Wyatt,I used to have one really good reason for staying in Pawnee.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Cool it.
Ben Wyatt,That was 200 years ago.
Ben Wyatt,"Fill out the forms, please."
Ben Wyatt,This is expired.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you think you might wanna take it easy on them a little bit?"
Ben Wyatt,It's not just for fantasy enthusiasts.
Ben Wyatt,It's a crossover hit.
Ben Wyatt,And they would never cancel Game of Thrones.
Ben Wyatt,"Nothing is wrong, just do your job."
Ben Wyatt,What did you just say?
Ben Wyatt,He gets his thing?
Ben Wyatt,Mmhmm.
Ben Wyatt,Mr. Ron Dunn.
Ben Wyatt,They're telling human stories in a fantasy world.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, and the park is open."
Ben Wyatt,Aw!
Ben Wyatt,I just couldn't live with myself if it had been true.
Ben Wyatt,You're wearing snow pants.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,Why do people keep assuming I'm ready to catch things?
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, man, this wine bottle is all out of the wine."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Where'd you come from?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,You know this hobo?
Ben Wyatt,Your sweater's on inside out.
Ben Wyatt,Dude.
Ben Wyatt,Are you a ghost?
Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Ben Wyatt,Can I come in?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,That was unpleasant.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie doesn't know I'm here."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know this text you sent me was a lie and Michael Stipe is not actually here, correct?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I knew it was."
Ben Wyatt,This is a budget meeting.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, thanks, we got it, we're good."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they'll be"
Ben Wyatt,How would we embarrass you?
Ben Wyatt,I want to.
Ben Wyatt,We are in real trouble!
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, we are in trouble here."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I don't even know--
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I got very curious when you only left me one voicemail message, instead of your usual 20."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God! I'm shamwowing all of your stress, and there's no one here to wring me out."
Ben Wyatt,This is such a great song.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,What is this?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, this is going really well."
Ben Wyatt,I'll definitely have one.
Ben Wyatt,Pretty decent turnout.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, is that the guy from the from the focus group?"
Ben Wyatt,I think it is.
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, sir, would you mind telling me how you heard about the event tonight?"
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, maybe we should move because we could make more money, or maybe we should stay here because it's cheaper to live here than in Chicago."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,You're always stressed out.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,What's up?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,And the fulltime barista who provided coffee for the masseurs.
Ben Wyatt,As are the masseurs.
Ben Wyatt,The baristas are gone.
Ben Wyatt,You had six fulltime baristas on the payroll.
Ben Wyatt,I appreciate that.
Ben Wyatt,It's a friendly wager on a high school basketball game.
Ben Wyatt,They're gone.
Ben Wyatt,400 Segway scooters.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's take a look at this list of assets owned by the Eagleton government."
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just-- okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here's the text I added a few more jokes, slamming Eagleton at the end."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure you wanna attack 'em at this press conference?
Ben Wyatt,How are you calm right now?
Ben Wyatt,Sell 'em.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,I didn't realize we were sending out invitations.
Ben Wyatt,We barely looked at the Mona Lisa.
Ben Wyatt,Can I talk to you for a sec?
Ben Wyatt,To Tom Haverford!
Ben Wyatt,Ohhh!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Ben Wyatt,Something about the sound of harps that makes me nervous.
Ben Wyatt,I can't.
Ben Wyatt,Give me some guidance.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm a relaxation novice."
Ben Wyatt,I think I'm still messed up from it.
Ben Wyatt,"So, treat yourself day is just a day where you go to the spa and then the mall?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, that'll do it."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,"We need everyone here to see a different side of Leslie Knope, not one specific person."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Some people just aren't gonna like you.
Ben Wyatt,Let it go.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't realize it could be this loud.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, what happened to the big picture?"
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, these numbers are going to determine everything for the rest of our lives!"
Ben Wyatt,But my parents threw me a prom in our living room.
Ben Wyatt,"Please, just tell me what you want me to do."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, wait, what's the number for the Louvre? I mean, maybe I can get a refund."
Ben Wyatt,Pretty good.
Ben Wyatt,We spent too much money on macaroons.
Ben Wyatt,What were we thinking?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I have been trying so hard not to stress you out, but we just spent our entire savings account on a trip to Paris."
Ben Wyatt,Raising three kids is going to cost 2 million dollars.
Ben Wyatt,Shoot!
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, of course it's the most amazing and wonderful thing to ever happen, but, okay, I am an accountant, and I am looking a cold, hard facts."
Ben Wyatt,"My prom was right after I got impeached, so I couldn't leave the house without being egged."
Ben Wyatt,The triple cherries.
Ben Wyatt,We're screwed.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you're that girl from the focus group thing I did."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, tell me about it."
Ben Wyatt,Is that so am I Michelle?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I don't know how else wait a second."
Ben Wyatt,Probably.
Ben Wyatt,I specifically requested elliptical cartridges for the turntables.
Ben Wyatt,How am I supposed to keep my Husker Du albums in nearmint condish?
Ben Wyatt,"No, not the concert."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, actually, and this is crazy, but it's children, plural."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, believe me, if the group's happy, I'm happy."
Ben Wyatt,Correct.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this is insane."
Ben Wyatt,"""Will you go to prom with me?"""
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts."
Ben Wyatt,"We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this just keeps getting weirder."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, I'll take that."
Ben Wyatt,"Hmm, I think I'm jealous of Harvey."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I thought you'd never ask, because we're nearing 40."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm dying!
Ben Wyatt,Course I will.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all right."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,But I just think it's for the best.
Ben Wyatt,I did DJ a little back in the day.
Ben Wyatt,Really.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man."
Ben Wyatt,Make a wish.
Ben Wyatt,I can't hear!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I like Larry.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm not a big bachelor party kind of guy, so when the guys asked me what my perfect night would be, I told them the truth beer and board games."
Ben Wyatt,"He is a good friend and a fine man with an inexplicably gorgeous wife-- I mean, to the point where it makes no sense at all."
Ben Wyatt,"No, we would have to tell Chris."
Ben Wyatt,They thought I was kidding.
Ben Wyatt,I was not kidding.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Getting off track.
Ben Wyatt,What's happening?
Ben Wyatt,Nice to be home.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"O, captain, my captain."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.
Ben Wyatt,Larry is my friend.
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, man."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,God!
Ben Wyatt,"He is a nice person, and we should all stand up and say, ""I... Like..."""
Ben Wyatt,"I had a show called ""Zoot Suit Wyatt"" on Carleton College radio."
Ben Wyatt,"Tuesdays from 3:00 to 5:00 A.M., I was the king of swing."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there's barely room for an actual basketball, much less a court."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm sorry, what's this?"
Ben Wyatt,I I don't want that.
Ben Wyatt,"Seven contiguous segments, giving me longest road and a sweetass ten points for the win."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, booyah!"
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we're basically vibe curators."
Ben Wyatt,"I hope that high school auditorium's big enough, 'cause I'm bringing 10000 maniacs."
Ben Wyatt,Ah This is the most stressed out I've ever been in my life.
Ben Wyatt,"I feel like, to me, set list flow is very important."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we do."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah, oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for indulging me.
Ben Wyatt,But maybe they'll be reasonable and not care.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you want to stick around?"
Ben Wyatt,It's a silly rule.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,I got a bunch of Homeland episodes burning a hole in my DVR.
Ben Wyatt,We're co-DJs.
Ben Wyatt,More of a rare coins guy.
Ben Wyatt,Help me.
Ben Wyatt,Help me!
Ben Wyatt,I got it.
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,You've got an eyelash on your face.
Ben Wyatt,You don't need to worry.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, come here."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hold on."
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to do that.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,I think we get it.
Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's the simplest luxury, but it makes all the difference."
Ben Wyatt,A little freaked out about it.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, let's go over our set list."
Ben Wyatt,I love a nice towel in my life.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I gotta tell you."
Ben Wyatt,Uhuh.
Ben Wyatt,"So, what, you're just gonna put your iPod on shuffle?"
Ben Wyatt,Because every single song you own is a banger?
Ben Wyatt,Do you wanna play some music?
Ben Wyatt,Did you go to Johns Hopkins?
Ben Wyatt,It's just an exact calculation.
Ben Wyatt,It's actually 34.2%
Ben Wyatt,That's weird.
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Glad I could help.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's maybe not the best idea for you."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Ben Wyatt,Thank you so much.
Ben Wyatt,"And, hey, you may be old, but you'll never be as old as me."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, are you hungry? I haven't eaten."
Ben Wyatt,You want a head massage?
Ben Wyatt,"They'll give us the hours we need, no problem."
Ben Wyatt,I think it's going great.
Ben Wyatt,I already talked to him.
Ben Wyatt,"Well nothing's going at all really, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,See you there.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, cool."
Ben Wyatt,Public Works is still paying them even though they haven't worked in two years.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I feel like I just did something wrong, she just doesn't seem to want to talk with me."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, ""Lesliemin."""
Ben Wyatt,"It's, I was reaching for paper."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie has a plan to raise cops' pensions and increase benefits without cutting back on hours.
Ben Wyatt,Football!
Ben Wyatt,What is going on?
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,He's like The Grandfather.
Ben Wyatt,"Newport's just gonna keep on buying you guys a couple new cars or some new uniforms, as always."
Ben Wyatt,"'Cause I thought it was on Beating a Dead Horse Boulevard."""
Ben Wyatt,I heard yelling.
Ben Wyatt,We're surrounded by hot guys.
Ben Wyatt,It makes you a normal human adult.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, are you okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"You haven't had time to keep up 'cause the last few years, you started two different businesses."
Ben Wyatt,That guy's all about short-term solutions.
Ben Wyatt,"Pretty sweet sauce in there, eh, Ace?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, the fact that you don't know what high schoolers are into doesn't make you uncool."
Ben Wyatt,"There are three employees designated as D1, or on retainer."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just look at this."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey Dr. Buttons I mean, my old calculator."
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't have a name.
Ben Wyatt,"You can say ""Okay."""
Ben Wyatt,Andy?
Ben Wyatt,"To keep the money in Parks, they're gonna shut down the Westside animal shelter."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, maybe I'll tag along."
Ben Wyatt,I don't have anymore work to do.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I wanna show you something."
Ben Wyatt,"So just don't say anything to anyone about anything forever, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, justâ¦ look, everyone's healthy and fine, but it's complicated."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it will be relaxing.
Ben Wyatt,That explains the outfit.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, man."
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Ben Wyatt,That is our actual situation.
Ben Wyatt,"The money had to come from somewhere, and the shelter is on its last legs."
Ben Wyatt,So they're closing it at the end of the week.
Ben Wyatt,There's a lot going on.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,To Ron.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook after a bad loss."
Ben Wyatt,"So, bachelor boy, how's it going with Diane?"
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, Chris wants to see us in his office."
Ben Wyatt,So she can force me to spend time with her again?
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,That's a good reason.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, is this health department business or Leslie business?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thanks."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you have learned nothing about basketball."
Ben Wyatt,It's really big.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you got everyone's attention with the Harvest Festival."
Ben Wyatt,We are the opposite of okay.
Ben Wyatt,So let's hit the gym again tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,"Even the greats get beat, but they get back out there the next day, and they fight."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you're gonna seal the deal."
Ben Wyatt,"It's just a, it's paper."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I'm nationally ranked, so it isn't even really fair."
Ben Wyatt,The Grand Godfather.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I-- You know, I..."
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, if you're not gonna play anything, I'm stepping in."
Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Why didn't you just throw it away?
Ben Wyatt,You ate an entire cheesecake?
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,You want to meditate real quick?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Wha?
Ben Wyatt,Everything is A-okay coolio beans.
Ben Wyatt,That's the point.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm totally fine, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Why would you say that?
Ben Wyatt,Yep.
Ben Wyatt,"You're thinking like a Parks department employee, not a city council candidate."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there's more where that came from, snoopies!"
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, what did you just say?"
Ben Wyatt,Party's over.
Ben Wyatt,I don't care.
Ben Wyatt,"Harvest Fest is two weeks away, and awareness is still pretty low."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but these interviews are more important than we thought."
Ben Wyatt,"And what was it, exactly, that led to you two hitting it off?"
Ben Wyatt,"Was she ill, or did your father witness her father committing a crime?"
Ben Wyatt,Or was she temporarily blind
Ben Wyatt,Jerry Gergich.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, I just I have a lot of adrenaline right now."
Ben Wyatt,How did you have that ready so fast?
Ben Wyatt,"You guys lost millions of taxpayer dollars, and we have to clean up the obscene mess you've made."
Ben Wyatt,Is it cancer?
Ben Wyatt,It was just like
Ben Wyatt,So you know that's everything that happens so it was just what happened.
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,You're all fired.
Ben Wyatt,And I swooped in and slashed their budgets to ribbons.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Chris pumped everyone up and made them feel positive and happy."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I really wish we would've talked about this first."
Ben Wyatt,Stay relaxed.
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Ben Wyatt,Tried to use slang.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,What why did you do that?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I'll finish this up.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, this might be a good thing."
Ben Wyatt,But there's a reason we strategize before we make decisions.
Ben Wyatt,What are you
Ben Wyatt,That was funny.
Ben Wyatt,The sky is really beautiful.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Andy!
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,"I am telling you that Leslie, in the long run, is so much better for this police department than Bobby Newport is."
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, why don't you take a whale sounds break, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I'm done talking.
Ben Wyatt,Whoo!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,What is what is that?
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Ben Wyatt,How do you afford all this stuff?
Ben Wyatt,That just came out.
Ben Wyatt,You're in a campaign literally.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Ben Wyatt,Give it back!
Ben Wyatt,It's not even the original lineup.
Ben Wyatt,I don't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, give it back."
Ben Wyatt,Everything you do right now is politics.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you erase the signatures?
Ben Wyatt,"We're just trying to raise some money for this concert, so no one gets stressed out."
Ben Wyatt,"Please, anyone."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,This is easily worth 500 dollars.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Just think about all their great songs, covering everything from the culture of Southern California to drug use in Southern California."
Ben Wyatt,This is signed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, come on, now."
Ben Wyatt,"I'll make some calls, see where we are."
Ben Wyatt,I never said that.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,Ha ha!
Ben Wyatt,Nice!
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Ben Wyatt,That's okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, just go up there, stick to your guns."
Ben Wyatt,And I don't want to work for them anymore.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, 90% of the charity work I did was to compensate for messes they caused."
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe this.
Ben Wyatt,I never break the law.
Ben Wyatt,I've never even jaywalked.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, everyone does it sometimes."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I've never even been to Colorado.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I had a layover in Denver once."
Ben Wyatt,Come on!
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,This-- you got me.
Ben Wyatt,"Good one, makin' me think I was gonna like die in federal prison"
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, that's super funny, you scamps."
Ben Wyatt,And everything you said about Sweetums was right on.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, if you apologize, it'll be an endorsement - for the Drink-ems plan."
Ben Wyatt,There's more at stake here.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, don't do this."
Ben Wyatt,How long is it gonna take?
Ben Wyatt,But what if Brazil and Argentina use their oil deposits as collateral?
Ben Wyatt,It means Jen wants me to keep working for her.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe.
Ben Wyatt,""" For Leslie, that means whipped cream, or No, it's whipped cream."
Ben Wyatt,"First stroke of luck we've had, and it's gone."
Ben Wyatt,"Not bad, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I have to say, Murray really came through"
Ben Wyatt,"""Go to the one who succumbs."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, we just have to work harder."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure that's not necessary.
Ben Wyatt,Let's just this is really good cheese.
Ben Wyatt,You should try some.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, good news is, we can call it a night and get a super early start on our door to door tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,I surrender.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, I was gonna get a chicken parm and watch Bladerunner."
Ben Wyatt,Me?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, are you talking about, like, jobwise?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay."
Ben Wyatt,Look at us.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"Um Well, we're in the home stretch here, and losing that interview didn't help."
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna go over some polling numbers and turn in early.
Ben Wyatt,I suggest you do the same.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, ""something wicked this way comes,"" ""whence you peruse a book with your thumbs."
Ben Wyatt,"H-2-flow is fluoride, right?"
Ben Wyatt,That's great news.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna look in the whipped cream cans.
Ben Wyatt,There is no food finer.
Ben Wyatt,I'll be attached with a little gum.
Ben Wyatt,There's a businessman in Florida who wants to run for governor.
Ben Wyatt,Do you mean alligators?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, sure, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,I'll just tread water until you're ready.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie and I aren't dating anymore, but, uh, we're friends."
Ben Wyatt,So it's fun.
Ben Wyatt,It's just fun.
Ben Wyatt,It's fun it's fun It is fun.
Ben Wyatt,I just got fired from Sweetums.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, unfortunately, there has been one consequence."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, guys."
Ben Wyatt,What's up?
Ben Wyatt,"Um, oh, I just remembered."
Ben Wyatt,Can I show you something out to the front area?
Ben Wyatt,And leave your cell phones because of no reason.
Ben Wyatt,"Just leave anything that can't get wet, actually, like you would normally."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here we go to the parking lot now."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, follow to me, guys."
Ben Wyatt,Just going to the parking lot for normal government reasons.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, can't go through with this."
Ben Wyatt,I was gonna pull a prank.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I hired these guys in ski masks to kidnap us, and I was gonna pretend to be a hero."
Ben Wyatt,"They were gonna shoot me and drive the van into the river, and that's when the divers would go in, pull you guys out of the water, and I would be standing on the shore like, ""Hey, you get pranked much?"""
Ben Wyatt,"I even got these squibs from a special effects guy, and I was gonna say this code word."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"Good sportsmanship, bro."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,I got you another melon-tini.
Ben Wyatt,"I was just here, like, three weeks ago for your wedding."
Ben Wyatt,What happened?
Ben Wyatt,"I know, and I know this makes the future a little murky, but right now everything's really preliminary, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,We'll know more in a week or so.
Ben Wyatt,But I like Tom.
Ben Wyatt,"And honestly, they smell terrible."
Ben Wyatt,And I can smell 'em from here.
Ben Wyatt,I can.
Ben Wyatt,"I can smell your dreams, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, he moved out, like, a week ago."
Ben Wyatt,You guys made this mess in a week?
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's just like a warning memo.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, ""Hey, all in good fun, but I'm your boss, and if you do it again, you're suspended."""
Ben Wyatt,That kind of thing.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"I guess I could stand to loosen up a little, but I don't know how to pull a prank."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that was me."
Ben Wyatt,And I didn't really like it.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,Are you guys frying marbles?
Ben Wyatt,A teriyaki hairpiece?
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, that guy is a jerk, and if you ask me, he smells like--"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hey, man."
Ben Wyatt,Sounded great.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, I got it in France."
Ben Wyatt,"No no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, let me know if anything changes."
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, France!"
Ben Wyatt,You guys enjoying that cheese?
Ben Wyatt,It's unpasteurized.
Ben Wyatt,Unpasteurized?
Ben Wyatt,"Technically, it's illegal in this country."
Ben Wyatt,I smuggled it back from Paris.
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, I want you guys to think of my office as a clubhouse, total open door policy."
Ben Wyatt,I wanna be your friend as well as your boss.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, April."
Ben Wyatt,"It's my first day as city manager, so I'm holding open office hours to break the ice."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, Chris was always the nice guy that made everyone happy, while I brought down the hammer."
Ben Wyatt,"But now that he's gone, I kind of have to do both."
Ben Wyatt,Everyone is the best.
Ben Wyatt,We're cutting vacation time.
Ben Wyatt,Let's eat vitamins.
Ben Wyatt,This is exhausting.
Ben Wyatt,Listen real quick.
Ben Wyatt,I have some super cool new rules
Ben Wyatt,That are also super mandatory.
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Ben Wyatt,Massive time waster.
Ben Wyatt,Kills productivity.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, and I'm having a good time."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, sanitation."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,"Let's go eat some batteries I mean, human food."
Ben Wyatt,"This is nothing, right?"
Ben Wyatt,How have I not thought of this before?
Ben Wyatt,Because it's hard to tell.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, the Maverick should be able to trade lumber for agriculture credits."
Ben Wyatt,"""The Cones of Dunshire."""
Ben Wyatt,"Well, yes and no."
Ben Wyatt,Are the cones a metaphor?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,That would be great.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, you are just a machine."
Ben Wyatt,Get stuff done.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, why don't you send it to me when you have a draft? I'll try to help."
Ben Wyatt,How did this happen?
Ben Wyatt,This should be green too.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, well."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you go get 'em."
Ben Wyatt,I love you.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,I can't do that right now.
Ben Wyatt,"Why, yes, I am, April! Let's go now!"
Ben Wyatt,"Wonderful! Hey, be careful out there."
Ben Wyatt,Traffic is nuts on the streets and roads.
Ben Wyatt,"Terrific! Hey, I'm hungry."
Ben Wyatt,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ah, ha, ha."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"This-- it's just cheese, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, let's talk health insurance."
Ben Wyatt,Have some illegal cheese.
Ben Wyatt,Buddy has to fly back to Indianapolis early something about a factory explosion.
Ben Wyatt,I got fired from running the Sweetums Foundation.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Congressman Murray has an 18 point lead."
Ben Wyatt,Calloway is out of money and has stopped campaigning.
Ben Wyatt,"So, congratulations!"
Ben Wyatt,Are you ready?
Ben Wyatt,"No, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Especially everyone.
Ben Wyatt,"This was a team effort, really."
Ben Wyatt,Are you ready?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,How'd you know?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, Miller Lite."
Ben Wyatt,No way! Look how blue it is.
Ben Wyatt,You were all fantastic.
Ben Wyatt,That sounds gross.
Ben Wyatt,"Weird, huh?"
Ben Wyatt,"Two people, who are about to have zero jobs."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,The boys in blue?
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, what can I do for you for?"
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, April, if you want, you can head back to Pawnee early."
Ben Wyatt,Wrap a few things up and
Ben Wyatt,Uh I'll be attached with a little gum.
Ben Wyatt,""" Oh, come on, Leslie, gimme a break."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, nothing except that I had nothing better to do."
Ben Wyatt,Your dependents don't have it anymore.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, blessing in disguise."
Ben Wyatt,"But I've had a week off in between jobs, and I've been cooking up something pretty big."
Ben Wyatt,Interview's off.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, sanitation, sanitation in the house tonight"
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,But the corporal can veto.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously, this would be much taller in the real game."
Ben Wyatt,"Like, for a scavenger hunt."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, um, my girlfriend left a clue here, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, each turn goes: Roll, buy, action."
Ben Wyatt,"Perfect, lots of choices."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, 16."
Ben Wyatt,Then you roll three dice to see how many dice you roll with.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how's it going?"
Ben Wyatt,The thing about the challenge play is that it's basically the gameâ¦ in reverse.
Ben Wyatt,"Nah, never mind."
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, let me tell you more about the trivia cards, 'cause you're gonna need to know about roadblocks first."
Ben Wyatt,The other amazing thing is the challenge play.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll just make a list of places she and I have been together, and hope we luck out and find the last clue."
Ben Wyatt,There's no way we'll finish in time.
Ben Wyatt,"Four cones wins, but in order to get a cone, you have to build a civilization."
Ben Wyatt,""" Well, this is the woman I've chosen to love."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the object is to accumulate cones."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the ledgerman just keeps score, and he wears this hat."
Ben Wyatt,"Two wizards, a Maverick, the arbiter, two warriors, a corporal, and a ledgerman."
Ben Wyatt,"Presenting ""The Cones of Dunshire,"" a brand new gaming experience."
Ben Wyatt,Which probably says more about me than them.
Ben Wyatt,"I took a job at this accounting firm, they've tried to hire me three times, I finally gave in."
Ben Wyatt,Heard about your speech.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, April, what's the score?"
Ben Wyatt,Brittany's dad is Ben Bernanke's dentist.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't appreciate being ambushed, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Let's just go home.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, of course."
Ben Wyatt,Nathaniel is related to Donald Rumsfeld.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Turns out Ellis is Congressman Murray's nephew.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I'm thinking of making some changes.
Ben Wyatt,There's no such thing.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so the clue is inside, but it takes a fiveletter code to open it Andy!"
Ben Wyatt,I get it.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, his powers were more spiritual."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Yoda wouldn't actually need networking."
Ben Wyatt,I really don't think it's that.
Ben Wyatt,And she has.
Ben Wyatt,We've gotten several noise complaints.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,That's a four letter word.
Ben Wyatt,I tried every fiveletter word that has anything to do with our third date.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"So, you always separate your lights from your darks."
Ben Wyatt,I am sorry you had to come in.
Ben Wyatt,"And then, you get your laundry-- Where is your laundry detergent?"
Ben Wyatt,For now.
Ben Wyatt,Every single one of these little twerps is seriously connected.
Ben Wyatt,It's kinda why we came here.
Ben Wyatt,"And then, I am going to teach you how to be adults."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I read it, but it seems like your farmers market rules may be specifically targeting chardbodies."
Ben Wyatt,"""No visible cleavage."""
Ben Wyatt,"""No strobe lights."""
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"""No chard-related innuendo."""
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what train, from which station?"
Ben Wyatt,"Instead of firing them, I am going to kiss their asses like crazy."
Ben Wyatt,"So, new plan."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Are you good?
Ben Wyatt,"Nolan, can I have a second to speak with my-- with Ms. Knope for a second?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,For six weeks of work?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie Knope, will you"
Ben Wyatt,Let me see it!
Ben Wyatt,Marry me?
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, why is that everyone's first suggestion?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,We're not revoking your license.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,You guys-- You wash your clothes in bubble bath?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I guess it's not that complicated."
Ben Wyatt,I better go.
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, I'm having a problem with some of the interns."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, hey, Jen."
Ben Wyatt,Just fire them.
Ben Wyatt,"They're totally replaceable, and I'm their boss."
Ben Wyatt,They're interns.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, Jessica's here."
Ben Wyatt,"God, this is insane."
Ben Wyatt,Remember last year when no one would get flu shots 'cause there was a rumor they turned you European?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, people get jittery about stuff like this."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, I feel like these interns do not respect or like me at all."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Where are you?
Ben Wyatt,This campaign seems beneath you.
Ben Wyatt,"No, you can't"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you and I go stargazing in Harvey James park, while my parents slowly strangle each other in the living room."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Not to sound rude, but what are you doing here?"
Ben Wyatt,"I got sick of treading water, so I swam over to Asia, made a deal."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this is our motivation."
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,He's terrifying.
Ben Wyatt,This is amazing.
Ben Wyatt,My parents got divorced and they hate each other.
Ben Wyatt,This is bubble bath.
Ben Wyatt,My family situation is complicated.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, if there's anyone who can bring my parents together, it's no one."
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, totally."
Ben Wyatt,I just have two small requests.
Ben Wyatt,"Shut up, Bulgaria!"
Ben Wyatt,"I know, well, that's the great thing about treaties, It doesn't even matter."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, babe."
Ben Wyatt,I am off city hall property.
Ben Wyatt,You have to stop.
Ben Wyatt,Firewall.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's interesting."
Ben Wyatt,You know why?
Ben Wyatt,Because
Ben Wyatt,Haha!
Ben Wyatt,Bank!
Ben Wyatt,Private property.
Ben Wyatt,Firewall restored!
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,"Private fountain, private property."
Ben Wyatt,"One, put Twizzlers on the candy table, and two, cancel the party because you invited my parents, and they can't be in the same room together."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Great, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,I'm safe.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie hid the location of our Valentine's meeting place in here."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh actually, I merged our treaty with Russia and China's treaty."
Ben Wyatt,How do you know what a cryptex is?
Ben Wyatt,No one can ever bring them together.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,We're going to clean this place up.
Ben Wyatt,Here's the deal.
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, so did I, in college."
Ben Wyatt,I'll call you when I get there.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,Love ya.
Ben Wyatt,"I've got to say that this report is quite impressive, Miss Knope."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,I hope I didn't screw up your Valentine's Day too much.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the fantastic work of one of your employees, especially if she's adorable."
Ben Wyatt,And work together.
Ben Wyatt,That we finish each other's
Ben Wyatt,What!
Ben Wyatt,I just want to admire it one more time.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, guys."
Ben Wyatt,I got it from here.
Ben Wyatt,"Again, fantastic work."
Ben Wyatt,""" Great."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, dude, do you play Ultimate?"
Ben Wyatt,"In fact, such good work I think I'm in love with you."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"You grab a slice of 'za, brah."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm down for a group hug."
Ben Wyatt,"Ellis, what's up, my male?"
Ben Wyatt,Little G.H.
Ben Wyatt,Bring it in.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm flying back to Washington."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so we've got all the ones from this side with the heart sticker."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I mean, I'm not making any decisions until we talk about this and everything it would mean."
Ben Wyatt,Kurtzwilder wants me to run his campaign from Florida.
Ben Wyatt,"You got it, Howie!"
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, rocked that scoober!"
Ben Wyatt,Someone please tell me we kodaked that moment.
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me?
Ben Wyatt,Nice catch!
Ben Wyatt,Let's do this!
Ben Wyatt,But the Barkley Group is the best at what we do.
Ben Wyatt,We're not in the business of losing elections.
Ben Wyatt,We can get you where you wanna go.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, guys, I'm sorry about all the new rules, But-- you know, I want you to like me."
Ben Wyatt,But I- I also really need you to respect me.
Ben Wyatt,"Let's do it to it, my dudes."
Ben Wyatt,What do you say?
Ben Wyatt,Everybody's invited.
Ben Wyatt,"Tomorrow morning, prework Ultimate in the park."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, listen up, pizza lovers."
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's actually not how respect is spelled."
Ben Wyatt,"No doubt, no doubt."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,"We should lock down some tight disc grabs, am I right, ellbones?"
Ben Wyatt,You can put those pics up anytime.
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,We should play tomorrow morning in the park.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm not exactly sure when the job would even starts, but it would probably mean putting our plans on hold."
Ben Wyatt,Come on
Ben Wyatt,I think he broke my wrist.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not kidding.
Ben Wyatt,I don't think I said that.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Crystal Skull it is.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's ridiculous to think that you could survive a nuclear blast by jumping into a refrigerator."
Ben Wyatt,"But still, it's like"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't think we have to do that."
Ben Wyatt,What is happening?
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, you are really good at this."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so Russia and China are about to propose their own plan, so the kids kinda want to get ours out there."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, when did you make this?"
Ben Wyatt,That's weirdly brilliant.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, how about me make it a cool 40?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I might need to not stay here anymore."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is important too."
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,I'm thinking about my future.
Ben Wyatt,"I am deeply, ridiculously in love with you and above everything else, I just I wanna be with you forever."
Ben Wyatt,"So, Leslie Knope, will"
Ben Wyatt,Glad you agree.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"I just, you know, I have a lot to consider."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to seem ungrateful."
Ben Wyatt,Take a pizza break on me.
Ben Wyatt,Everybody chill out.
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Ben Wyatt,Pizza.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Guess what's in these boxes, everybody?"
Ben Wyatt,One of the fun things.
Ben Wyatt,"""Chardbodies: Get a chard on""?"
Ben Wyatt,What do you want me to do?
Ben Wyatt,"By ""rules of conduct,"" do you mean that wooden sign you made that says, ""Peas be kind to others""?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I admit this is a little iffy, but"
Ben Wyatt,I can't do anything until I check the rules for city vendors.
Ben Wyatt,She is.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there were no bedbugs."
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go buy a bed.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Are you eating turkey chili off of a frisbee?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,What have you guys got against washing dishes?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Harrison Ford movie night."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, this is city business, and I'm not an emperor."
Ben Wyatt,I can't just kick them out for no reason.
Ben Wyatt,"It's just, you know, still kind of weird, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Look, now that we're working together again, maybe it would be good to keep our home life and our work life separate."
Ben Wyatt,"Like we only talk about work stuff when we're at city hall, like a firewall system."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, listen, I'll I'll come for a bit, but if it's okay with you, I'm not going to stay."
Ben Wyatt,"Also, no bed."
Ben Wyatt,"Wood, hello."
Ben Wyatt,Tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,It's fine.
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to order a singing telegram.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"""Data had never felt this way before."
Ben Wyatt,"Of course, data had never felt anything before."
Ben Wyatt,"But Captain Picard couldn't help but note ""the smile that crept over his mechanical but lifelike face."""
Ben Wyatt,I understand.
Ben Wyatt,Just one second.
Ben Wyatt,"""As they walked down the hall into the bridge"""
Ben Wyatt,It's not supposed to be a negotiation.
Ben Wyatt,"For God's sake, I'm asking for 15% effort."
Ben Wyatt,15
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, but do people in this town really believe in curses?"
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"And by the way, you should take it seriously, because I asked you to come work here because I thought you'd enjoy it and I think you're smart, but you have to have some semblance of professionalism, and I need you to give, like, even a 15% effort."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you may not take this seriously, but this job is important to me."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh right, one of those."
Ben Wyatt,All right?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, yeah, I think I'm gonna go."
Ben Wyatt,Shh.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I like it."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, my wife lost her job, so maybe something sad and slow?"
Ben Wyatt,And I see the merits of it.
Ben Wyatt,Do you know anything from the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm hanging up now, bye."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, think about what you're saying."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, I you probably don't want to listen to that"
Ben Wyatt,Another City Council campaign?
Ben Wyatt,"I know what you're doing, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,When he was 8.
Ben Wyatt,Is it you?
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, at least you won't have to deal with that guy anymore."
Ben Wyatt,Are you gonna murder me and bury me at this gas station?
Ben Wyatt,Tom's party sounded kind of fun.
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,This guy is unbelievable.
Ben Wyatt,Another sex scandal?
Ben Wyatt,Just 'cause
Ben Wyatt,"no, listen, it"
Ben Wyatt,We don't we don't
Ben Wyatt,We don't need to April
Ben Wyatt,Trust me.
Ben Wyatt,Don't judge me.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know I'm a broken record, but getting away from the City Council is absolutely the best thing for you."
Ben Wyatt,There'll be other salt packets.
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, it's okay."
Ben Wyatt,We've already been down this street.
Ben Wyatt,This is a bad idea.
Ben Wyatt,You you can't do this.
Ben Wyatt,"Plus, we lost that little pony."
Ben Wyatt,"This is bad, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I do have a little going-away gift."
Ben Wyatt,I honestly felt like I was cursed or something.
Ben Wyatt,Again.
Ben Wyatt,"I got an opportunity I couldn't say no to, and I have to quit."
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,Today's my last day.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, it's moving."
Ben Wyatt,It's moving.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, Barney, I'm afraid I have some bad news."
Ben Wyatt,Finally.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,No! We're out of gas.
Ben Wyatt,"Ice Town, and now, this."
Ben Wyatt,Aah!
Ben Wyatt,Did you find the 25th clue?
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm fine now, as long as we get out of here as quickly as possible and never come back."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I just worry if we're both in Asia, it might limit our scope."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Wow. Why even say that already?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Take that, curse."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry I left.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, gross, but we can handle a little bad publicity."
Ben Wyatt,"Is everything okay or... Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's hilarious."
Ben Wyatt,I'm screwed.
Ben Wyatt,A nice candle!
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go rub it in their face.
Ben Wyatt,Screw romantic dinners.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Right now.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we have to go catch them in the act."
Ben Wyatt,So are you ready to go have our first ever Valentine's dinner?
Ben Wyatt,"Eh, some of them were kind of tough."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, I miss him every day."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, you're a genius."
Ben Wyatt,"She's waiting for me somewhere in Pawnee, and I'm not gonna be there."
Ben Wyatt,Any ideas?
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I want to get her a present to cheer her up on her last day."
Ben Wyatt,Heartwarming.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just a reminder, guys, today is Leslie's last day as a city councilor, so everyone be extra supportive."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"If anyone could appreciate it, it's you guys."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get into it.
Ben Wyatt,What do you guys have for health tips?
Ben Wyatt,Left it in the break room.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, for one, we don't even live in Dexhart's district."
Ben Wyatt,You know we broke up.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't want to spend 51% of our time in his district, it's basically a dumping ground for old shipping containers."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I feel like I should probably just go."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you were totally fine until I got involved."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I'm jinxed or something.
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, well, I'll help you out."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"""Stumbling for the first time in months, ""the Knope campaign seems to be rolling down ""a ramp to nowhere."
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,This is awesome.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I wish I was better at this."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Then you could be making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe we take the fight to her?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean I could try to get you on Perd's show, and you could tell him how she stole your idea."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll just do that."
Ben Wyatt,"I can call, or maybe I'll just go down there."
Ben Wyatt,So we're going?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm excited to bond a little with April."
Ben Wyatt,She's like the little sister I never had.
Ben Wyatt,Because the little sister I do have is normal and not terrifying.
Ben Wyatt,"Mo' money, mo' problems, that's what I always say."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"We're extremely confident that there is no curse, and everyone is going to have a great time tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,I'm really sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"So, I'm going to get out of here."
Ben Wyatt,I found one.
Ben Wyatt,Obviously some more than others.
Ben Wyatt,are heroes?
Ben Wyatt,We have to go get it.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it's not here."
Ben Wyatt,But I did get you one other present to take your mind off of all this.
Ben Wyatt,You're welcome.
Ben Wyatt,That the boys in blue
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, uh, may I say"
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,9 11.
Ben Wyatt,"I Sometimes I say that, too."
Ben Wyatt,Ha ha ha.
Ben Wyatt,I finished it last week.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't know, I was going to try to get a jump on some work this weekend."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,"All right, I'm in."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, we might be able to sneak out early."
Ben Wyatt,You get snacks.
Ben Wyatt,I'll bring music.
Ben Wyatt,We'll jam out to some sweet tunage.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know what you're thinking, but you have a press conference in 10 minutes."
Ben Wyatt,All right?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm the curse, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, Shauna's not here."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"I never break any laws, ever Because I'm deathly afraid of cops."
Ben Wyatt,"Been a long time, eh, cap'n?"
Ben Wyatt,"Why don't we gather everyone in here, you explain to them what you're thinking, and we get some feedback."
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, listen to yourself, loopholes, scorched earth policies. This isn't you."
Ben Wyatt,Perv Dexxxhrt equals birthday mouse?
Ben Wyatt,I love it.
Ben Wyatt,"""Second chunce four Lesle"""
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,You love Italian men?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you do love them both."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I love these things."
Ben Wyatt,"Man, I need to, like, wrap my head around this."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I just think we need to take a deep breath, think about if this is really worth it."
Ben Wyatt,You've got to see this.
Ben Wyatt,"I miss you, too."
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Ben Wyatt,"He's never lost an election because he runs brutal, scorched earth campaigns."
Ben Wyatt,"And also, Dexhart fights dirty."
Ben Wyatt,"Because every time we do, it just makes it harder."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, uh, I kind of look at it like it's your favorite directors making a mix tape just for you."
Ben Wyatt,It's like a raccoon shanty town.
Ben Wyatt,"And I kind of feel like we shouldn't Hang out together, just the two of us."
Ben Wyatt,Or Captain.
Ben Wyatt,Ah.
Ben Wyatt,Is that a picture of you?
Ben Wyatt,Same time zone.
Ben Wyatt,I have no reason to be.
Ben Wyatt,I do.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not afraid of cops.
Ben Wyatt,"Nope, I'm good."
Ben Wyatt,"You remember Jen Barkley, political consultant and power broker."
Ben Wyatt,""" From Dead Poets' Society."
Ben Wyatt,I finally figured it out.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I've been thinking for weeks of what to get you as a ""last day in City Council"" present."
Ben Wyatt,"We were just being honest, but if you really want to do this, of course we'll support you."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry if it felt like everyone piled on.
Ben Wyatt,Always helps to end on the call to action.
Ben Wyatt,I'd swap those two lines.
Ben Wyatt,I kinda want to roll up my sleeves and make geopolitical problem solving my bitch.
Ben Wyatt,"""Oh, Captain, my Captain!"
Ben Wyatt,Almost out of gas.
Ben Wyatt,I'll wait till we're on the highway.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the GPS says we should take 495 to 270, but check out this cool alternate route I found"
Ben Wyatt,Because.
Ben Wyatt,Other cars.
Ben Wyatt,Will you not do that?
Ben Wyatt,Please don't.
Ben Wyatt,Please don't do
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, great, here comes a guy."
Ben Wyatt,I'll just shut off the car till it opens up.
Ben Wyatt,"Holy [Bleep], it's hot."
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,"Good lord, it is hot."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, you did, right there."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I got nine, three and four."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, who are you calling?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Cindy."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,It's really good.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,Did you draw that?
Ben Wyatt,How are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,Everyone.
Ben Wyatt,Everyone has seen it.
Ben Wyatt,It's not.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, Star Wars is not that nerdy."
Ben Wyatt,You're like a ninja crossed with a Jedi or something.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, you are just knocking these off."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh Oh, wow, look at that."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, maybe the maybe the hat."
Ben Wyatt,I found it.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, that was really fun this morning, huh?"
Ben Wyatt,Um hey.
Ben Wyatt,maybe we should put a pause on the fashion show.
Ben Wyatt,We have to go over your talking points.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, okay, Ms. Knope, what is going to be your first major public works project?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't know what the big deal is.
Ben Wyatt,I've just got to be honest.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"If I'm murdered tonight, start the investigation with those two guys."
Ben Wyatt,You asked her out for me?
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, you guys sure take the startup paperwork seriously around here."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Another round, please?"
Ben Wyatt,She kicked our asses.
Ben Wyatt,Um... Vaguely.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, nice work on the jobs research."
Ben Wyatt,What am I looking at?
Ben Wyatt,He's not doing anything.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
Ben Wyatt,Bazooka.
Ben Wyatt,Right in the chest.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, she's like a hurricane."
Ben Wyatt,"Take that, curse."
Ben Wyatt,She's everywhere.
Ben Wyatt,"So, somebody, I don't want to say who, it was totally me, got Sweetums to donate another fifteen cotton candy machines."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,He's not a robot.
Ben Wyatt,He's just thinking.
Ben Wyatt,He's got a lot on his mind.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Why would a robot need to consume organic matter?
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"You know what, they probably put a TV in there, and he's watching old speeches to bone up or something."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go see.
Ben Wyatt,"Congressman, here is the briefing packet for our strategy meeting later."
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, congressman."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we dissolve the loanout and file bankruptcy."
Ben Wyatt,Are you hitting on Leslie for me?
Ben Wyatt,Does he do something?
Ben Wyatt,Ellbow.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ellis."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Kevin."
Ben Wyatt,Frank seems cool.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all good things, I hope."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, sure."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no No, that's okay."
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
Ben Wyatt,Good to see you again.
Ben Wyatt,"How you doing, Barney?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ben Wyatt, reporting for duty."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, it's unbelievable."
Ben Wyatt,Um I think you should just go with something basic No nonsense.
Ben Wyatt,He's gonna smell your dreams now.
Ben Wyatt,Give me Tommy Fresh.
Ben Wyatt,Mr.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hey, that's gotta be Feinstein's car."
Ben Wyatt,We were all seriously confused about that.
Ben Wyatt,So that's why you tried to kiss him.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I just feel like it's kind of odd for me and him to hang out with you."
Ben Wyatt,"Honestly, if you want to just go out with him alone, I'd be totally okay with it."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, like a week ago, right?"
Ben Wyatt,I'll just throw this in the garbage.
Ben Wyatt,I'm good.
Ben Wyatt,What does he do?
Ben Wyatt,"What's the deal with the congressman? Seriously, like, he seems a little robotic Or something?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, you don't need to explain the ritual."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom!"
Ben Wyatt,A question for you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, why is he so famous?"
Ben Wyatt,Do you know anyone who's looking for a roommate?
Ben Wyatt,What's the deal with this pony?
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, ha, ha, ha."
Ben Wyatt,I-- What?
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's me."
Ben Wyatt,Never mind.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's it's a it's from 40 years ago."
Ben Wyatt,"So, what am I missing?"
Ben Wyatt,I'm looking.
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, why don't you just Tell me where it is and I can get out of here?"
Ben Wyatt,I didn't.
Ben Wyatt,I've been staying at the Pawnee Super Suites Motel for seven months.
Ben Wyatt,"It's a charming little inn with wonderfully random wakeup calls, delightfully unstable temperatures, and, as of yesterday, bedbugs."
Ben Wyatt,"""Four stars,"" says nobody."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, see you later."
Ben Wyatt,Drinkin' coffee.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I understand.
Ben Wyatt,Ellchupacabra.
Ben Wyatt,"Please, stop."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
Ben Wyatt,That way only our clients have claim to the assets.
Ben Wyatt,Then we dissolve the trust.
Ben Wyatt,"Clients ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""F,"" they would have to agree, but if they went for it, we could arbitrate."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as a rule, you shouldn't take advice from your opponent's campaign manager."
Ben Wyatt,Hello? He's fantastic.
Ben Wyatt,I totally get it now.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Goodbye.
Ben Wyatt,"What's up, guys?"
Ben Wyatt,I think it's safe to say I made the right choice.
Ben Wyatt,I love calzones!
Ben Wyatt,Those are calzones!
Ben Wyatt,That's not pizza.
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,See what we got here.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Ben Wyatt,Need a cup to perk me up coffee in the morning
Ben Wyatt,I don't get it.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, what if it's a trick?"
Ben Wyatt,At all.
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I didn't really do Model United Nations in high school, so Oh, wait."
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,It's kind of a small horse.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, maybe she thinks our original plan would work, and she convinced you to use her plan instead because she knows that won't work."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, what am I missing? Am I crazy?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't need the details or anything."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,You talked to Barkley without me?
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I would be insane to say no.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I-- wow."
Ben Wyatt,Wh-- Seriously?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I got a raise, and my fridge is full of calzones, so not complaining."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, yes."
Ben Wyatt,"Please, just steer."
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Ben Wyatt,That was a great road trip.
Ben Wyatt,We made it 40 feet.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,So fun.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how about next weekend we fly to Pawnee? Tickets are on me."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,"Nah, never mind."
Ben Wyatt,I don't feel like it.
Ben Wyatt,See how it feels?
Ben Wyatt,No one ever brings that up.
Ben Wyatt,I was also shortstop of my J.V baseball team.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you know, when I was an 18 year old mayor, I tried to build a winter sports complex called Ice Town, and it bankrupted the city."
Ben Wyatt,"So, just type up those ones we talked about, and we'll get it finalized tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,What was all that stuff with you and Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,He really is amazing.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah. No, I totally heard that."
Ben Wyatt,I super did.
Ben Wyatt,"His name is congressman David Murray, he is our boss and he is white."
Ben Wyatt,April's not my daughter.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm your boss, and you can't keep disrespecting me like this."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I don't care who you're related to."
Ben Wyatt,I could check that out.
Ben Wyatt,Tom emailed me.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what is that?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I can't do this."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that sounds cool."
Ben Wyatt,That's not inspiring.
Ben Wyatt,That sounds like something that will be a big success.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just doing my job.
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Ben Wyatt,What if we dissolve the trust?
Ben Wyatt,"Um, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I'm with you."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, like everything that you put your paws on."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you're a you're a great artist."
Ben Wyatt,"Sure, sure."
Ben Wyatt,Your fingers.
Ben Wyatt,She's my friend.
Ben Wyatt,Does everyone think she's my daughter?
Ben Wyatt,Or the real best case scenario is if she just takes the money and doesn't even try.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey."
Ben Wyatt,Don't embarrass me.
Ben Wyatt,"Congressman Murray, I'm Ben Wyatt, coordinating director of D.C. Operations."
Ben Wyatt,She's better at this than I am.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey. Well, I think I'm allergic to chutney."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, I really feel like I know you already."
Ben Wyatt,I've watched all of your speeches and debates.
Ben Wyatt,It's very inspiring.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, what's chutney?"
Ben Wyatt,It was great.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's make sure we're ready for the strategy session tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Do you wish I were taller or what's going on?
Ben Wyatt,"We are going there to get Ned Jones' endorsement, and that's huge."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, don't let Barkley knock us off message."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to."
Ben Wyatt,"Let me get some actual food, and then, do you know that wildflower mural up on the second floor?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah? You wanna meet there?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,It's playing every hour on every channel.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, twice in the last week, and everything is 100% up to code."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, she would never do that to me."
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,Don't say that.
Ben Wyatt,I have no idea what the code is.
Ben Wyatt,"It's beautiful, and it won't."
Ben Wyatt,We are not leaving this fountain until we've figured this out once and for all.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, honestly, how do you think I'm doing?"
Ben Wyatt,Because I feel like we're getting along pretty well.
Ben Wyatt,It's air-tight.
Ben Wyatt,"But I have to warn you, it's not super sexy."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, listen up."
Ben Wyatt,You would be the middleman between dry cleaners and the companies that sell chemicals to dry cleaners.
Ben Wyatt,"First of all, why does everyone in this town use AltaVista? Is it 1997? And second, I am a budget specialist."
Ben Wyatt,Right?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,And I am working very hard to make sure that this town gets back on its feet.
Ben Wyatt,I'm trustworthy.
Ben Wyatt,Trust me.
Ben Wyatt,Because I'm trusty.
Ben Wyatt,Hang on.
Ben Wyatt,Look at this guy.
Ben Wyatt,"""30 years of experience ""with a degree in architecture from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen."""
Ben Wyatt,His name's Wreston St. James.
Ben Wyatt,He's from Eagleton.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is the really exciting part."
Ben Wyatt,"We buy tetrachloroethylene at 1.60 a gallon, but we sell it back at 2.38 a gallon."
Ben Wyatt,Now I know what you're thinking.
Ben Wyatt,What if it's a cleaner who wants to buy glycol ethers?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we don't have a lot of time, and he is the first decent candidate."
Ben Wyatt,So let's at least go meet the guy.
Ben Wyatt,It's gross.
Ben Wyatt,I could take a little jaunt with you.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I know this idea doesn't excite you."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, this better work out."
Ben Wyatt,"So, there you go."
Ben Wyatt,Seems unnecessary?
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,"Restaurants were ranked number one in Accounting Magazine's ""Riskiest Businesses"" issue."
Ben Wyatt,"That was their last issue before they folded, actually."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, this is great, Barney."
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, that's amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,But I have to quit again.
Ben Wyatt,You should totally be chief.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,Magazines are also very risky.
Ben Wyatt,I'm really sorry.
Ben Wyatt,But I just don't want to do this.
Ben Wyatt,"And yeah, I screwed up when I was 18, but who doesn't do dumb stuff when they're 18? Joan?"
Ben Wyatt,I need to move my life in another direction.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, formulas are my formula for moolah."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie's been saying for weeks I should do something I love, and she's right."
Ben Wyatt,"I went to those towns because they were bankrupt, and now, they aren't."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I'm not."
Ben Wyatt,But I do have an idea.
Ben Wyatt,And I'll help Tom or maybe try to do that TV thing or maybe work for the Sweetums foundation.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,Life is short.
Ben Wyatt,"Why be an accountant, you know? I mean, other than the stability and the health plan and the above-average pay."
Ben Wyatt,You could endorse Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,Me too.
Ben Wyatt,I don't like it.
Ben Wyatt,It's disgusting.
Ben Wyatt,Look at my arm.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Rhett Butler.
Ben Wyatt,That's who he reminds me of.
Ben Wyatt,Or Bono!
Ben Wyatt,I'll see what they say.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, look what Wreston commissioned from the balloon artisan."
Ben Wyatt,It's us.
Ben Wyatt,How about we just invest the money?
Ben Wyatt,Make 4% a year.
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man!"
Ben Wyatt,I could tell you what I would like when I was their age.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, set up a nice little nest egg for the city."
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,I regret telling you that very much.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you may not know this, but Leslie was actually born in Eagleton."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Maybe it's not the sexiest idea, Tom, but it's smart."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie and I feel terrible for war breaking out at your Model U.N
Ben Wyatt,"We have a mural called ""The Many Surrenders of Pawnee."""
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Can I speak to you privately for a minute?
Ben Wyatt,I have chills.
Ben Wyatt,But I promise it'll make you a lot of money.
Ben Wyatt,The scientists think it's going to linger for another 40 years.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, isn't that just playing right into what they think of you?"
Ben Wyatt,What's that?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what exactly happened between the two of you, anyway?"
Ben Wyatt,Dull?
Ben Wyatt,Does this look dull to you?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, he's a cop."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,"No, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,"He's in love with you, and he has a gun?"
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. St. James, I have to say, this park is incredible."
Ben Wyatt,Because of all the smiles that occur?
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,He seems super cool.
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,I was perhaps a little icier than I needed to be.
Ben Wyatt,I wish I could say it's possible.
Ben Wyatt,"Once she starts thinking about birthday cake, she's basically useless until she eats birthday cake."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, this is not a good sign."
Ben Wyatt,I just I don't know if it is right now.
Ben Wyatt,I'll take it to the Peruvian senate.
Ben Wyatt,Or whatever.
Ben Wyatt,I'll try.
Ben Wyatt,I... For...
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, except for the smell."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Seems impossible.
Ben Wyatt,How do you know about Camp David?
Ben Wyatt,Let's introduce ourselves.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,This group has an incredibly important job.
Ben Wyatt,You need to figure out how to hold this town together.
Ben Wyatt,Just chill.
Ben Wyatt,Peace out.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, Doug, who cares?"
Ben Wyatt,"""Hey, Doug from Bloomington is thinking about buying a shirt."""
Ben Wyatt,"I move around a lot, so the friends I make in these cities, they're like Facebook friends, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,Happy anniversary.
Ben Wyatt,So I know we agreed on no gifts.
Ben Wyatt,But I did get you a gift.
Ben Wyatt,"A bunch of them, actually."
Ben Wyatt,"I was gonna surprise you with them yesterday, but they never reached you."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I can't believe I actually defeated Leslie Knope at a gift exchange."
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,It's the Iron Throne.
Ben Wyatt,Ohh!
Ben Wyatt,It's the Iron Throne.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know I'm making that dumb surprise face, but I can't help it."
Ben Wyatt,"This is the greatest gift I've ever received, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die."
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, new people."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it does."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,A lot of homes were very gradually flooded.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm I'm sorry, you want me to run your nonprofit wing?"
Ben Wyatt,She's actually handling it pretty well.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie's on her way in."
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, I'm so sorry."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man!"
Ben Wyatt,Larry!
Ben Wyatt,It's 8:00.
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, you made it."
Ben Wyatt,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,It's loosely based on the Klingon greeting salute.
Ben Wyatt,This is where they have their public forums?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, at least our merger is going well."
Ben Wyatt,We even have a secret hand signal in case we think she needs help.
Ben Wyatt,Tom would make a great profile for your show.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this is a guy who's learned through an unbelievable series of bonehead business moves."
Ben Wyatt,Cheers.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Andy and Tom were right when they said the DeMarcos don't matter."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Their generation's the past.
Ben Wyatt,The way to make this merger take hold is to focus on the future.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you, but I'm a little shaky on live TV."
Ben Wyatt,"Back rubs, YouTube videos of turtles and birds becoming friends"
Ben Wyatt,"Anything she could possibly need to get her through these final hours, we got it covered"
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,Come here.
Ben Wyatt,Things will turn around.
Ben Wyatt,Also can you tell me what time that show about storage units is on?
Ben Wyatt,Five more seconds.
Ben Wyatt,There's no other way to get her a bathroom break unless we bring the bathroom to her-- that's nothing.
Ben Wyatt,I've read the entire charter.
Ben Wyatt,You said you genuinely valued my business acumen.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm your boss."
Ben Wyatt,"Nicely done, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,We have 15 sponsorship offers.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's pretty cool."
Ben Wyatt,That's That's not true.
Ben Wyatt,30 minutes to go.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah? Bravo! Thank you very much.
Ben Wyatt,"More like ""Turd Crapley."""
Ben Wyatt,"Now, here's the best part."
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, wait, wait."
Ben Wyatt,I love living there.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, how's work out there, Dave?"
Ben Wyatt,"So, no, I'm not perfect."
Ben Wyatt,Okay? This is the little scar I got when I was nine and I fell off my bike.
Ben Wyatt,"But, no, this is a birthmark, Perd."
Ben Wyatt,And I know you wouldn't do that to me.
Ben Wyatt,But I know that we're buddies.
Ben Wyatt,"If I thought you were serious, I'd be offended, Perd."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, if you're passionate about this, keep at it."
Ben Wyatt,Fair point.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, my accounting job isn't boring."
Ben Wyatt,I turned it down.
Ben Wyatt,"Come hither, peasant."
Ben Wyatt,Come here.
Ben Wyatt,Who are you?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, listen."
Ben Wyatt,If you're not-- if you don't know what you're talking about
Ben Wyatt,Stay out.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm gonna finish my work Oren, no!"
Ben Wyatt,"Then why would you need to put on rollerskates? Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! We're just-- we're just-- skates."
Ben Wyatt,Your fingers are salty.
Ben Wyatt,We don't have to go to the party.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you must be exhausted."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, maybe the birthday party she's throwing for me right now."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for that.
Ben Wyatt,They're just being polite.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, they always ask me to go out with them."
Ben Wyatt,"Probably just gonna take it easy, but thank you."
Ben Wyatt,I don't think so.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, she was just telling me she's been nominated to run against you in the recall."
Ben Wyatt,I'm not mad.
Ben Wyatt,"No, I'm not."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna put on a costume because I'm not really attending this party That's at my house."
Ben Wyatt,"She didn't have time to hug me, but she could do that?"
Ben Wyatt,You were amazing.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but it was just a management position at Urban Outfitters."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, that was great, Thank you."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this was bad press."
Ben Wyatt,Three strikes and she is done.
Ben Wyatt,She has to talk the whole time.
Ben Wyatt,"Me, too, Perd."
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, she worked with James Carville?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, it's fine."
Ben Wyatt,I take it we're having a party.
Ben Wyatt,"But, if something horrible happens, and you want your kids to be left alone with no safety net, just so they can learn some kind of weird lesson, then, by all means, leave your fortune to the wild boar who gores you to death."
Ben Wyatt,What matters is that you teach them the right values.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look, it doesn't matter how much money you leave your kids."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Just know that it's perfectly healthy to be thinking about-- Oh, you're joking."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Am I right?
Ben Wyatt,"Thinking about how to divide up your possessions for when you die, it's tough, confronting your own mortality, and I think it's got you spinning a little bit."
Ben Wyatt,I think I know what's happening.
Ben Wyatt,We need to talk.
Ben Wyatt,"Iced tea, please."
Ben Wyatt,"And can I ask you, how are there palm trees here?"
Ben Wyatt,"What the hell happened, man?"
Ben Wyatt,Well Good!
Ben Wyatt,"If you swear to me that you're serious, maybe we can salvage this."
Ben Wyatt,I think you're wrong.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie is a very forgiving person.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, Donna's been awfully quiet."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah really?
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,Huh?
Ben Wyatt,Why should you guys tell me you're gonna have an enormous party?
Ben Wyatt,"He didn't do it, and he fired the people who did."
Ben Wyatt,No it's not.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't tell you I was gonna be quietly working in my room.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm gonna talk to Wreston, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this."
Ben Wyatt,Look.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, we could just figure out a different strategy for picking a slogan."
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to go on their show.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there were some sticky moments."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we can size her up, but more importantly, it'll humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you."
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to set up a meeting.
Ben Wyatt,Is this gonna work?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, we can't do that."
Ben Wyatt,Because of the party.
Ben Wyatt,Because I won't be able to sleep.
Ben Wyatt,"If you need me, I'll I'll definitely be awake."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he must've shelled out a fortune to hire her."
Ben Wyatt,Newport's scared.
Ben Wyatt,I'm honored.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, I'm--I'm incredibly flattered."
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, is this a joke?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, that's 5%? That is a lot of money."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I guess you are gonna teach them a lesson."
Ben Wyatt,"What, I didn't break it."
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, 5 whole percent."
Ben Wyatt,She ran two Republican congressional campaigns and a Senate race.
Ben Wyatt,"because it's sitting right in front of us, and it's broken."
Ben Wyatt,What up?
Ben Wyatt,But this just doesn't make sense to me.
Ben Wyatt,"Essentially, we're going to put a ramp on every building in town."
Ben Wyatt,Just delete the poll.
Ben Wyatt,Just saying.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,RoboCop didn't have guns for arms.
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, if you can step back and let Larry take control, you can survive anything."
Ben Wyatt,"God, that's"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Uh We should yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, looks like someone's gonna be late for her meeting."
Ben Wyatt,We're gonna go.
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I was just caught off guard."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, screw it."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Isn't that a little childish?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, bud."
Ben Wyatt,So I feel like we haven't gotten a ton of time together since I got back from D.C.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie has plans tonight, so I'm solo."
Ben Wyatt,You wanna hang out?
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Lots of hugs.
Ben Wyatt,Stay strong.
Ben Wyatt,Let them work it out.
Ben Wyatt,And trust Larry.
Ben Wyatt,You see?
Ben Wyatt,Why are we at a mall?
Ben Wyatt,"No, you really didn't."
Ben Wyatt,"Hand the reins to someone else, let them handle things while you manage from a distance."
Ben Wyatt,"You're having a public forum on the slogan, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Let the slogan thing go.
Ben Wyatt,"No, not at all."
Ben Wyatt,It's so small we don't even need to do an environmental impact report.
Ben Wyatt,"It's inexpensive, it benefits the town, it's a total slam dunk."
Ben Wyatt,Ohh.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm actually from Minnesota."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm in love with a woman from here."
Ben Wyatt,"A strange, passionate, goof ball of a woman."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie was just out with her friends blowing off some steam.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, real quick."
Ben Wyatt,Remember when you said you would close up shop on the slogan thing?
Ben Wyatt,"You did do that, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"You didn't somehow get the email addresses for every person who voted for the ""Stick up the butt"" slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email telling them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"What's a ""Donezo list""?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, someone wrote those emails."
Ben Wyatt,And we got about 300 complaints and as a cherry on top some hackers got really mad about the invasion of privacy and attacked the website.
Ben Wyatt,Look what they did to Peebo.
Ben Wyatt,He's wearing a hat made of penises.
Ben Wyatt,"Well I.T. is fixing the website, but it will be down for about three days."
Ben Wyatt,Your suit looks more like garbage.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Ben Wyatt,I like this suit.
Ben Wyatt,"Or, I'm sure the state government would love to use your money to hire more bureaucrats, maybe build a library."
Ben Wyatt,"But that's the whole point of moving up the ladder, you get to think bigger, swim in a bigger pond."
Ben Wyatt,Use it as a test.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm on your side, and I'm furious too."
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm starting to get kind of turned on imagining you as a dictator, is that bad?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know we should figure out how to fix this."
Ben Wyatt,"Now go do work, or I will fire you."
Ben Wyatt,I'm not kidding.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,So you can kiss your park and four years of work goodbye.
Ben Wyatt,Up to you.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,You can do it.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I don't want to over-hype this, but presenting... Dun-da-da-dah!"
Ben Wyatt,the new city of Pawnee website!
Ben Wyatt,Totally revamped!
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's just some mascot thing that the designer put up on the front page."
Ben Wyatt,You can You can do it.
Ben Wyatt,"But more importantly, you can now apply for a utility tax refund online!"
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. St. James, this has been a strange day."
Ben Wyatt,But we wouldn't want to leave you with the wrong impression of Pawnee.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, we would love to have you design the park, and in the spirit of reconciliation, Leslie would like to apologize."
Ben Wyatt,I guess we'll just set fire to the studio or something.
Ben Wyatt,And we'll do it at JJ's Diner.
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a good idea.
Ben Wyatt,"I think if you click on the bamboo, it puts on a top hat."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,A lot.
Ben Wyatt,"Could be one of those dudes that kisses mannequins or whatever, but I like a woman in skates."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,Cool! Thanks for clearing that up.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Then count me in as the second investor in Tom's Bistro.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you've been very rude to him, and you need to apologize."
Ben Wyatt,The session ends at 11:00 P.M.
Ben Wyatt,"We're well-aware of that, but believe me, Tom has thought this out."
Ben Wyatt,"See, there's plenty of real estate available in the old Eagleton part of town."
Ben Wyatt,"And with the recent closures, there's massive demand for affordable dining that feels high-end."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"I know this is a dire situation, but I swear to God, this is like a crazy sex fantasy for me."
Ben Wyatt,Fine with me.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, is it too late to cancel?"
Ben Wyatt,Home field advantage.
Ben Wyatt,It's an early '90s party.
Ben Wyatt,Let's just focus on the problem.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, if we don't stop that interview from airing in the morning, this campaign is dead."
Ben Wyatt,So We have to go to Indianapolis.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,A mid-'90s party?
Ben Wyatt,"It's like, what is this?"
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,"Really happy that worked out for you, Tom, but you kinda sold me out back there."
Ben Wyatt,Were you listening to him when he was talking about serving the public and making our communities better?
Ben Wyatt,"You know who he sounds like, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"He's got Monster, but not Automatic For the People."
Ben Wyatt,I just asked the DJ what REM albums he has.
Ben Wyatt,"To each his own, I guess."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,You.
Ben Wyatt,Get this.
Ben Wyatt,And then you can come to our wedding.
Ben Wyatt,"As far as things go, it's pretty innocuous."
Ben Wyatt,"Everyone has a thing, and that's mine."
Ben Wyatt,"I swear, I keep seeing a bird in this studio."
Ben Wyatt,Is there a bird in here?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you know, sometimes, I feel like I might need glasses."
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I told you, I'm not gonna participate in your weird Julia Roberts, cameraman husband fantasy."
Ben Wyatt,"And after 36 years, they are still divorced."
Ben Wyatt,My parents' method of problem solving is to kind of keep everything bottled up and just subtly hint at what's bothering them.
Ben Wyatt,My family is very nonconfrontational.
Ben Wyatt,Who?
Ben Wyatt,Who hasn't had gay thoughts?
Ben Wyatt,So All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, the good news is your poll was a big hit."
Ben Wyatt,Thousands of people voted.
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"The current leader is ""Pawnee, welcome to Douche nation."""
Ben Wyatt,Crazy Ira and the Douche got their bonehead radio fans to flood the poll with write-in votes.
Ben Wyatt,Why did we include a write-in option?
Ben Wyatt,Aw!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I guess go ahead."
Ben Wyatt,Out.
Ben Wyatt,Now.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, stay back, stay back."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe that's all there is to it.
Ben Wyatt,I was 18 when I was elected mayor.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"So, excuse me for that."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"It's in May, and we haven't planned it yet, but save the date."
Ben Wyatt,I have a thing for women in skates.
Ben Wyatt,We're going to this address in Indianapolis.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm proud of myself for that.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not freaking out!
Ben Wyatt,I'm not freaking Uh
Ben Wyatt,And I'm not going to.
Ben Wyatt,"No, I shouldn't."
Ben Wyatt,"I know, that's I know."
Ben Wyatt,"So it seems like it went really well, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"She can't lean on anything for support, and no one else can help her."
Ben Wyatt,You want to squeeze in one more practice session?
Ben Wyatt,He's a horrible monster.
Ben Wyatt,I can.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,So we're just about ready to go live with the slogan poll.
Ben Wyatt,You want to see?
Ben Wyatt,I don't have them on me.
Ben Wyatt,I should.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy."
Ben Wyatt,Do you know how that I should call her.
Ben Wyatt,Cindy Eckert had just turned me down for senior prom.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, what?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I did."
Ben Wyatt,But let's focus on the more important issue.
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Ben Wyatt,"The Sweetums molasses storage vat exploded, resulting in a slow moving ecological disaster."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, yes."
Ben Wyatt,I'll see you there as soon as possible.
Ben Wyatt,"So, I'm not going to spend 150 dollars on a tent."
Ben Wyatt,So what's your plan?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just gonna sleep on the floor.
Ben Wyatt,Not bad.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,They're out shopping.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man, that would be amazing."
Ben Wyatt,I moved into the spare room.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah sure of course."
Ben Wyatt,Why do they want to destroy it.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,No no no.
Ben Wyatt,She's never down for that long.
Ben Wyatt,"yeah no, I'm sure it is."
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,The thing about being part of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force is that it's a very easy job.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"If Chris gets cranky around noon, just stuff some chia seeds into a fig works every time."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, she's just running around trying to pull off an elaborate, thoughtful surprise for you."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Where's Chris?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that old Chestnut."
Ben Wyatt,I feel kinda bad just getting him a gift card.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, you gave it a try, but this quilt thing is not going to work."
Ben Wyatt,What was the third time?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I still don't think it's gonna work, but I am really attracted to you right now."
Ben Wyatt,Great meeting.
Ben Wyatt,13's just obnoxious.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, this one has my name on it."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, and, uh, 12 point."
Ben Wyatt,And obviously make sure the content's perfect too.
Ben Wyatt,"These college interns really need to be whipped into shape, but don't worry, because they call me Devo, 'cause I can ""whip 'em good."""
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, April."
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"No Geneva, no Garamond, definitely no Papyrus."
Ben Wyatt,"Times New Roman, across the board."
Ben Wyatt,2008 Indiana state audit spreadsheets?
Ben Wyatt,"Man, that year was insane!"
Ben Wyatt,"Let's try to be consistent with our fonts, okay? There's a crazy amount in these memos."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I've been going over your reports."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,He plays for the NFL.
Ben Wyatt,You don't even want to talk to that guy?
Ben Wyatt,That might actually work.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so we have a little farewell gift for you."
Ben Wyatt,"We all pitched in and got you a gift card from that home store, ""Pots and Pans."""
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that card's for three pans."
Ben Wyatt,"Man, he put a lot of work into our presents."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like those are perfect gifts for you.
Ben Wyatt,There's like a 30% chance they'll both die.
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
Ben Wyatt,Flipped through the bylaws.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,Less cute.
Ben Wyatt,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,She's so cute when she's coming up with destructive ideas.
Ben Wyatt,I couldn't help it.
Ben Wyatt,Don't let her get a tattoo.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,"Later, bro Heisen."
Ben Wyatt,It makes a lot of sense.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, that's cute."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, Dad, Leslie worked really hard on this, so can you just cool it for, like, 30 seconds?"
Ben Wyatt,"""Box 1 of 12""?"
Ben Wyatt,Mom!
Ben Wyatt,Ann!
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, there's a lot of stuff in here."
Ben Wyatt,New pajamas.
Ben Wyatt,JJ's diner mug.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, Waffle Mix."
Ben Wyatt,"""Love, Leslie."""
Ben Wyatt,It absolutely did not have to be done.
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"""Hey Ben, just a few things to remind you of home."""
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,Toasts are fun.
Ben Wyatt,Camping?
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Ben Wyatt,Do you guys do this a lot?
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,I don't think there's anything I can do.
Ben Wyatt,Hopefully there are a few other reasons.
Ben Wyatt,Looks like we hit a wall.
Ben Wyatt,That's not gonna happen.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what do we have for Chris?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I found some old receipts from lunches we had together."
Ben Wyatt,Is that anything?
Ben Wyatt,I flushed my car keys down the toilet.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, it is one of the basic rules of government that you shouldn't offend people."
Ben Wyatt,"No, God oh God."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Just respect me.
Ben Wyatt,Stop using my comforter for your pillow forts.
Ben Wyatt,Stop referring to my bedroom as a common space.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, tell me about stuff happening in the house."
Ben Wyatt,All right maybe you have to start thinking about how how your actions affect me.
Ben Wyatt,He should probably change his name to something a little more exotic if he wants to make it big in perfume.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,"Dennis Feinstein, though?"
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,Me too.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Ugh, does it hurt?"
Ben Wyatt,That's horrifying.
Ben Wyatt,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,I have total faith in you.
Ben Wyatt,"Point is, stick to the list and you'll do great."
Ben Wyatt,Stop being obtuse.
Ben Wyatt,Was it Nathaniel?
Ben Wyatt,You're all my friends too.
Ben Wyatt,Who do you think drew it?
Ben Wyatt,And are you going to finish doing them?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Ellis, have you put the campaign pictures up on the website?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure, in a wrestling match, Kirk would win."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, you can say that again."
Ben Wyatt,"But overall, who would you rather have at the helm of your Sovereign class starship?"
Ben Wyatt,JeanLuc Picard.
Ben Wyatt,"If anything, I'm holding her back."
Ben Wyatt,No contest.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, we need to do some basic organization."
Ben Wyatt,And... Uh... Bye.
Ben Wyatt,Where do you put your bills when they come?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Mom."
Ben Wyatt,Nice to see you.
Ben Wyatt,"This is Leslie Knope, my fiancee."
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you have to pay these."
Ben Wyatt,"No fighting tonight, Mom."
Ben Wyatt,Good thing I didn't lose them.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,New lesson.
Ben Wyatt,Basic finance.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna teach you how to balance a checkbook.
Ben Wyatt,Are we gonna die here?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I can't move."
Ben Wyatt,I think that was the right call.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, just look I thought I could handle being friends with you."
Ben Wyatt,"But I can't, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"I do, as a person, but as city manager, I'm not 100% sure you have a case."
Ben Wyatt,I won't.
Ben Wyatt,You're not listening to my side.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, sometimes when we disagree, you're so passionate, I feel like I'm arguing with the sun."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I won't."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm not planning on hurting her."
Ben Wyatt,I think I can crack the code.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not!
Ben Wyatt,Ellis?
Ben Wyatt,Why would any of you think I would hurt Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Now, we agreed the other night that we can't spend time together."
Ben Wyatt,Amazing news Buddy Wood's flight was delayed.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, let's just admit it."
Ben Wyatt,We're in a weird position.
Ben Wyatt,We're married.
Ben Wyatt,"Our professional status has flipped, like, five times."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, now I'm your boss."
Ben Wyatt,"This is ""un-charded"" territory for us."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,I learned from the best.
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, forget firewalls."
Ben Wyatt,"Let's just be respectful and communicate, and we'll find the right balance."
Ben Wyatt,"So, if we can get to the airport right now, the interview's back on."
Ben Wyatt,Let's get out of this fountain.
Ben Wyatt,I am going to teach you how to open a bank account.
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, that's specific."
Ben Wyatt,I'll admit it.
Ben Wyatt,This town is full of lunatics.
Ben Wyatt,And you have great ideas.
Ben Wyatt,"But, you're great."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, this was a terrible idea."
Ben Wyatt,Bleh.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"But why don't we just talk about it later, in this building?"
Ben Wyatt,"Um, I don't think I can."
Ben Wyatt,"How about I swing by later and we'll just, you know, we'll go over everything?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, that's why we were at the police station today."
Ben Wyatt,We're trying to get Chief Trumple's endorsement.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I did get in trouble for shaking one"
Ben Wyatt,I have to say.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually checked out that snow globe museum that you recommended, and it was pretty awesome."
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't work that way.
Ben Wyatt,You can't just chop up the aspects of a relationship into discrete parts and select the ones you want like a buffet.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here is a list of errands and things that human adults need."
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm giving you an advance on next month's rent, and I want you guys to go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond and get everything on that list."
Ben Wyatt,You can handle this.
Ben Wyatt,"No, I can't, I have a date."
Ben Wyatt,"It's actually not, Chris set it up."
Ben Wyatt,Never mind.
Ben Wyatt,Because it's selfish.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, if this is the way people want to buy their produce, so be it."
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just glad that we could all come to an agreement.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,Things are going surprisingly well.
Ben Wyatt,And pack it up.
Ben Wyatt,"It's over, we're screwed."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, a bomb?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Dad, hi."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,Unh.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Ulani."
Ben Wyatt,Thought you weren't coming.
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, thanks, everybody, for coming."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,They usually signify the end of a party.
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry you all have to go home.
Ben Wyatt,I called a cab.
Ben Wyatt,It's outside.
Ben Wyatt,"I gave the driver 100 bucks to sit and wait, so whenever we're ready to go like, maybe right now all we have to do is walk outside."
Ben Wyatt,And Oohah!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,Best thing to do is distract them with innocuous talk about the stuff they care about.
Ben Wyatt,Happy Valentine's Day.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they're white people from Minnesota, so hockey, fishing, skiing, sailing, and after a few drinks, put on a Prince album."
Ben Wyatt,Don't mention the Green Bay Packers or the state of Iowa.
Ben Wyatt,"And also, I have enough frequent flyer miles to get us to Australia tonight."
Ben Wyatt,I call this wonderful spot.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't really go camping ever, Jerry."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we will."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Here you are, Ulani."
Ben Wyatt,"It's kind of cute, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I am really sorry."
Ben Wyatt,I need to I need to pay.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,You might wanna borrow this.
Ben Wyatt,"Gotta say, I'm impressed."
Ben Wyatt,"Your mission statement made sense, and you didn't use one R. Kelly lyric."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I already have a job, but I'll help as a friend."
Ben Wyatt,As long as you take what I say seriously.
Ben Wyatt,I don't want another Entertainment 720 disaster on our hands.
Ben Wyatt,Stop where you are and take off your clothes.
Ben Wyatt,It's couples massage.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,Where's Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's a danger of doing things a day early, I guess."
Ben Wyatt,Should I text her and try again?
Ben Wyatt,It's not dirty underwear.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I have been kind of tense lately.
Ben Wyatt,Just thinking about the new Star Wars sequel.
Ben Wyatt,I'm afraid they're gonna rely too heavily on CGI.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm carrying it all in my shoulders.
Ben Wyatt,I know you must feel awful.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh Larry, would you like to get a couples massage with me?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, champion."
Ben Wyatt,The owner of the motel I'm staying at said she was gonna screen Hope Floats in the lobby.
Ben Wyatt,I got it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, what's the new company?"
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,Pass.
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a really great idea.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,Why not?
Ben Wyatt,Whoo!
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, did I peak when I was 18?"
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, see, iit was important for me-- See, I took a job in City budget crisis management, and now I work for a candy charity."
Ben Wyatt,"But, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure, I mean, part of that sounds very appealing."
Ben Wyatt,Something totally different.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I was probably just gonna stick with this."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I'll stop by."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground?
Ben Wyatt,But you just have to keep climbing back up that hill.
Ben Wyatt,Is the Eagleton side really that much better than the Pawnee side?
Ben Wyatt,"I was impeached when I was 18, and it was brutal."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I know the feeling."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, I think, um Things are starting to get a little out of control here."
Ben Wyatt,Asked me if I wanted to watch.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's not totally true."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that joke killed at the accounting firm."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's say goodbye to Ms. Knope, kids."
Ben Wyatt,No worries.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it's not too late to cancel the waffle buffet or the Hilary impersonator, but a lot of these deposits were non-refundable."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Larry."
Ben Wyatt,You up for a boys' day out in a horsedrawn carriage?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thus begins our enchanted adventure."
Ben Wyatt,"God, that movie really was amazing."
Ben Wyatt,And you know what doesn't get enough credit in that movie?
Ben Wyatt,The score.
Ben Wyatt,"Good sir, tally ho."
Ben Wyatt,That is definitely from the movie.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,"Um, can you let me go?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Wicks, if you've read our proposal, you'll see that an alliance between RentASwag and Sweetums could be mutually beneficial."
Ben Wyatt,"And you know what I think it needs, actually, is a papier-mache Li'l Sebastian!"
Ben Wyatt,But we should focus on the haunted house.
Ben Wyatt,I thought it best to revisit the concession speech at a later time.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man, that is so good."
Ben Wyatt,What are you Stop it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, please, come into my room."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Is that okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm just having a butterfinger."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"It's a white flag, and you may as well start waving it right now"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,I'm out front.
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,"excuse me, Madame Ambassador."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah you seem fine."
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Ben Wyatt,Then why do I have the microphone?
Ben Wyatt,I move that the Security Council formally condemn Denmark and stop them from making any more unwarranted acts of aggression.
Ben Wyatt,All in favor of the resolution.
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's great."
Ben Wyatt,So you're gonna do great.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's interesting."
Ben Wyatt,What's that?
Ben Wyatt,The resolution passes with flying colors.
Ben Wyatt,Denmark is formally condemned.
Ben Wyatt,Bam!
Ben Wyatt,I am so prepared.
Ben Wyatt,I watched Enchanted three times to get all the details right.
Ben Wyatt,"And then another two times, because that movie is amazing."
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, there."
Ben Wyatt,I'm Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,I'm assistant city manager
Ben Wyatt,Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,You want to go grab lunch together?
Ben Wyatt,Super casual.
Ben Wyatt,"So just call me Bond, municipal bond."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm getting married, and I wanted a good stable job, so I'm going back to Accounting."
Ben Wyatt,Probably go home and grab something.
Ben Wyatt,"You're starting a new life with your new family, so it's an empty buddy box to fill with memories for your little buddy."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, it was a group effort."
Ben Wyatt,"You too, man."
Ben Wyatt,Come here.
Ben Wyatt,This is the idea of the century.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Awww!
Ben Wyatt,This was supposed to be a happy occasion.
Ben Wyatt,"You were supposed to come here, celebrate your son's engagement, maybe bury the ax? And not in each other's back."
Ben Wyatt,"What, no, no, Andy."
Ben Wyatt,She did not.
Ben Wyatt,I think we like each other.
Ben Wyatt,"But Chris has this very strict rule, coworkers can't date."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, in fact, we insist that you don't."
Ben Wyatt,But you do have to show up and tell us that you had a great time.
Ben Wyatt,That's the deal.
Ben Wyatt,"You can either take it, or you can take it."
Ben Wyatt,So it's not even an option.
Ben Wyatt,We are sober.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Guys.
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, sir."
Ben Wyatt,What is it?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,We only have 30 bucks left.
Ben Wyatt,"Nothing, we're friends, just regular friendship development."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we got one more gift for you."
Ben Wyatt,Though you know you're not supposed to bring your dishes into work right.
Ben Wyatt,We feel bad because you got us such thoughtful gifts and we got you three pans and a bag of nothing.
Ben Wyatt,You're what?
Ben Wyatt,What about the wedding?
Ben Wyatt,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Wyatt family."
Ben Wyatt,To the future.
Ben Wyatt,Okay
Ben Wyatt,Is this in Arabic?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's real cute."
Ben Wyatt,I have an idea.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I got your text."
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,"So, how did we do?"
Ben Wyatt,Do you have anything to numb the pain?
Ben Wyatt,"No, did you buy plates"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie
Ben Wyatt,"Normally, I would get in the cab with you, but I am so sick of them ruining everything, and I really liked that unity quilt."
Ben Wyatt,It was an awesome quilt.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, my parents are insane, but they need to be at our wedding."
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,It's time for this team to come up with a new plan.
Ben Wyatt,I would love to do that.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just not sure if the driver would be okay with it.
Ben Wyatt,Let's do this.
Ben Wyatt,Hey man.
Ben Wyatt,No problem.
Ben Wyatt,I'm serious.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, she wasn't really my type."
Ben Wyatt,Listen Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Let go of me.
Ben Wyatt,A few hundred favors.
Ben Wyatt,Mr. Vice President.
Ben Wyatt,Ben Wyatt from congressman Murray's office.
Ben Wyatt,You need to let go of me.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not gonna make my stupid surprise face this year because this time I got her the most amazing gift ever.
Ben Wyatt,"And she'll never see it coming because I'm giving it to her today, one day early."
Ben Wyatt,So she's gonna make the face this year.
Ben Wyatt,She will make that stupid face!
Ben Wyatt,I think we're all done.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you for accommodating us on such short notice.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, Mr."
Ben Wyatt,Vice President.
Ben Wyatt,Had enough?
Ben Wyatt,This is a pacifist protest.
Ben Wyatt,What's that?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's actually the same accounting firm I almost joined last year, and they gave me a great package Three weeks of vacation, matching 401(K), and a pretty sweet windbreaker."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, remember, under no circumstances can Leslie know about what's going on."
Ben Wyatt,"She has to make that face, do you understand?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"I asked for Larry's help because he has the most successful marriage of anyone I know, to a gorgeous woman."
Ben Wyatt,"Which, honestly, is still a mystery to me."
Ben Wyatt,"Like, was it a hypnosis accident or something, where they put Gayle under and made her fall in love with Larry and never said the magic word to snap her out of it?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, if I say ""nutmeg,"" will she wake up and start screaming?"
Ben Wyatt,Called in a few favors.
Ben Wyatt,At least we have each other.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's a little better than that."
Ben Wyatt,Whizzingham manor.
Ben Wyatt,It's illegal.
Ben Wyatt,It's another funny name for the bathroom That I thought of.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, Andy, I am so sorry."
Ben Wyatt,I was there.
Ben Wyatt,I did.
Ben Wyatt,You're my wife.
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, the big day is tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,Not exclusively.
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, Chris, we have to tell you something."
Ben Wyatt,Uh that's a stretch.
Ben Wyatt,What are the anniversary rules?
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I love you too.
Ben Wyatt,"That's right, no gifts."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, that sounds kind of great."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for coming with me to get my stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, just remembered."
Ben Wyatt,I kind of got you an engagement present.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know who that is.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,So let's go over this again.
Ben Wyatt,And... And I look forward to the moments in my day where I... Where I get to hang out with the town and talk to the town about stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"Really, that?"
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"The newspaper headline was, ""Ice Town Costs Ice Clown His Town Crown."""
Ben Wyatt,They were big into rhymes.
Ben Wyatt,Andy has a meeting?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Got your message.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"It's not a big deal, but."
Ben Wyatt,It's an old family recipe.
Ben Wyatt,"Mmm, I love me a calzone."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, she was just flirting a little."
Ben Wyatt,You don't have toâ¦
Ben Wyatt,"You could build a much bigger campus in this neighborhood, and basically break even."
Ben Wyatt,"We've laid out construction costs, retail space options."
Ben Wyatt,Here's a complete proposal for Gryzzl's new regional corporate headquarters.
Ben Wyatt,"Cruel, but fair."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure she's not really interested in me.
Ben Wyatt,"Left the chicken soup there, just in case."
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, what are you doing?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I guess you will."
Ben Wyatt,"It was never completed, and I got impeached."
Ben Wyatt,"So, nice work, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, kind of."
Ben Wyatt,Called it Ice Town.
Ben Wyatt,"Damn it, you're transferring your crying thing over to me."
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Ben Wyatt,"You ready, babe?"
Ben Wyatt,"You literally never said the words ""city council."""
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you never even mentioned you were running for office."
Ben Wyatt,"Come on in, man."
Ben Wyatt,"What's up, Chris?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you need a ride back to the office?"
Ben Wyatt,Penguin wedding?
Ben Wyatt,That's cute.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"Seal the edges by crimping the fork aw, crap."
Ben Wyatt,Good Lord.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, they need our help."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"You know, the festival thing's getting pretty huge, and a couple loose ends that need tying up."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, definitely."
Ben Wyatt,Look.
Ben Wyatt,"When I was 18 and I became mayor of my hometown, I used every last dollar we had to open a giant winter sports complex."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, yeah, that was awful."
Ben Wyatt,Donna.
Ben Wyatt,But I'm not gonna take care of him for you.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not gonna send a three legged dog to his death.
Ben Wyatt,"So, all that matters is that we are good."
Ben Wyatt,And it's not like this is the only career option for either of us.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, me neither."
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"So, did anyone have any insights on our ""running for governor"" situation?"
Ben Wyatt,"Because I'm finally doing what I love, and I know how hard it is to get to that place."
Ben Wyatt,Ooh!
Ben Wyatt,"And I want you to be happy, because you're my friend."
Ben Wyatt,"Last time I took it, I was a Tom."
Ben Wyatt,Where did you get a Washington Monument figurine at midnight on a Tuesday?
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie and I are dating.
Ben Wyatt,That's great.
Ben Wyatt,You're behaving very strangely.
Ben Wyatt,We haven't told anyone because there's a rule against office relationships.
Ben Wyatt,But it's happening.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry we didn't tell you before you touched my knee, and I trust you won't tell anyone now since it could get your daughter fired."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,We'll find you something you like.
Ben Wyatt,I've got a few more ideas.
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, man, just go home."
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,April.
Ben Wyatt,Just makes sense.
Ben Wyatt,"Indiana native, supremely qualified, and she wrote that she wanted to be governor in her kindergarten dream journal."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, she got approached by the DNC and they think she has a great shot to win."
Ben Wyatt,What're you up to?
Ben Wyatt,Leslie is running for governor of Indiana.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"We have 110, and counting."
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,I was wearing this.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you said you needed eighty total businesses to participate."
Ben Wyatt,You want to leave this to chance?
Ben Wyatt,"You, Leslie Knope, the queen of planning and binders and pro and con lists."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,April.
Ben Wyatt,You looked at one horrifying job.
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Go ahead and let it out, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it got so late."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just exploring whatever fun activity pops into my brain.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they call me ""the Swiss Army Accountant."""
Ben Wyatt,They don't call me that.
Ben Wyatt,"I guess we could go to a pharmacy, but I really don't want to use like a cheap plastic ring."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, absolutely."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, uh Calc you later."
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, honestly, I'm great."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you like that one, huh?"
Ben Wyatt,Do you want one?
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Or, as you Americans like to say, calzones."
Ben Wyatt,I am out of ideas.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just learning how to make a ""calizoinza."""
Ben Wyatt,Joan Callamezzo has a book club?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, things aren't that chaotic."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,She's fine.
Ben Wyatt,We just weren't sure you were still coming.
Ben Wyatt,Everybody's either in bed or out looking for Champion.
Ben Wyatt,Seems silly to stay at a hotel that's 10 minutes from our house.
Ben Wyatt,Children.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm Ben, this is April."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm scared of death.
Ben Wyatt,Every department is losing a Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,Champion ran away.
Ben Wyatt,Don't even joke about that.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"My boss in Indianapolis, he wants me back on the road in a week."
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently they want me to bring Avatar, and 50 pairs of 3D glasses, and a 3D capable television."
Ben Wyatt,I'm teaching myself how to do Claymation videos.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Ron, we're moving on."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, check this out."
Ben Wyatt,Not me.
Ben Wyatt,You would maintain fiscal responsibility after we're gone.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,It's precisely because of your beliefs that we need to keep you.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Isn't this just so cool?
Ben Wyatt,"I got you some waffles here, courtesy of JJ's diner, and chicken soup, courtesy of me."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, if you really wanted to do it, we'd find a way."
Ben Wyatt,Jewelry store.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, it's unfortunate, but the stakes are too high."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you two are on a date."
Ben Wyatt,"So, Leslie and I should probably get going."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God!"
Ben Wyatt,"His 60 foot boat, Bobby's boat, handed to him when he was 12."
Ben Wyatt,"His cushy job at his dad's candy company, handed to him."
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's been handed everything on a silver platter.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie is so good at so many things and so bad at that.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Tom Haverford.
Ben Wyatt,"""Never stop dreaming."""
Ben Wyatt,"But then this morning, Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him."
Ben Wyatt,Surprise.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, did I did I do it right?"
Ben Wyatt,I've been moving around so much the past few years.
Ben Wyatt,It might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
Ben Wyatt,How's it look?
Ben Wyatt,We can't just stop campaigning.
Ben Wyatt,"We stop, we lose."
Ben Wyatt,"Your victory speech, Councilwoman Knope."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, every time you come to our house, we are so happy to see you."
Ben Wyatt,Don't you even want to know what she has to say?
Ben Wyatt,"No, that's closed, that's why we're doing this."
Ben Wyatt,How?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,It's part of her house.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, okay."
Ben Wyatt,Jen is a powerful political operative.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.
Ben Wyatt,I think maybe that's not such a good idea.
Ben Wyatt,And none of them caused the city's unemployment rate to hit 30%.
Ben Wyatt,"Great, actually."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten."
Ben Wyatt,Can't believe they're finally giving me the key to the city.
Ben Wyatt,"Your mom kind of, um, made a pass at me."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, congratulations to you."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm so used to packing for them, I almost put in diapers for myself."
Ben Wyatt,I hate this so much.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you very much."
Ben Wyatt,I never wrote it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Ben Wyatt,"I'm a little chilly, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, there."
Ben Wyatt,Two.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport.
Ben Wyatt,It will take two minutes.
Ben Wyatt,I love you and I like you.
Ben Wyatt,"And all signatures need to be notarized, and I really don't want to have to schedule two different notary appointments."
Ben Wyatt,Water makes it worse.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Ooh.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, she makes the second highest salary in the department."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"In the last few weeks, we've turned this campaign into a well oiled machine."
Ben Wyatt,"It's just, Jen Barkley kind of approached me about running."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I mean, that's amazing."
Ben Wyatt,How long are you two going to go on like this?
Ben Wyatt,That kind of sucks.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Water makes it worse.
Ben Wyatt,You're acting like a little kid.
Ben Wyatt,There you are.
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, don't forget"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie's stump speech is 10 minutes and 40 seconds every time.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"I lived in villages with eight people, rural farming communities, college towns."
Ben Wyatt,I was sent to every corner of Indiana.
Ben Wyatt,And then I came here.
Ben Wyatt,"And I realized that, this whole time, I was just wandering around, everywhere, just looking for you."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, now we're just wasting time, Jerry."
Ben Wyatt,We're going to get the final results any minute.
Ben Wyatt,See how the Parks Department has changed.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, maybe we can drop by the old stomping grounds."
Ben Wyatt,Good idea.
Ben Wyatt,It will go a long way.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby.
Ben Wyatt,Could you please focus?
Ben Wyatt,"That's fine, that's fine."
Ben Wyatt,"So, we've solved it."
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,I think we can just keep going.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah?"
Ben Wyatt,Please don't bail on me because of what just happened.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, but it's the ninth highest selling multiplayer figurine based strategy fantasy sequel game in history."
Ben Wyatt,And it's all going to be great.
Ben Wyatt,A lot.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, we should just go, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Someday.
Ben Wyatt,It will happen.
Ben Wyatt,Careful.
Ben Wyatt,But we have to pick up the kids and we have a flight to catch.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, okay."
Ben Wyatt,It's possible.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how's Leslie's ad going?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, this is the Hawaiian god of anger."
Ben Wyatt,It reminded us of you when you're at work.
Ben Wyatt,No one knows where she is?
Ben Wyatt,"Right, right."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
Ben Wyatt,This is a nice house.
Ben Wyatt,Not that sneaky.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, that's a problem?"
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Jen, I didn't know you were here."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry to bother you, but I need you to sign this Point of Sale document."
Ben Wyatt,And please sign it in cursive.
Ben Wyatt,It raises a lot of red flags if you don't.
Ben Wyatt,"Here, check this out."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Need to remain neutral.
Ben Wyatt,"See, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Terry, come on, man."
Ben Wyatt,"When you attacked, you kind of came off like a bully, and he looked sympathetic, so, you know, you did a really good job of easing off."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's my briefcase."
Ben Wyatt,You've got to be kidding me.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Can't we just say it was there?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just trying to distract you, so you don't have a nervous breakdown."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't think I should discuss that, given that you're in competition."
Ben Wyatt,Bye.
Ben Wyatt,"In my time working for the state government, my job sent me to 46 cities in 11 years."
Ben Wyatt,There will be a big laugh right now.
Ben Wyatt,You're putting an awful lot of salgar on your pasta.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, unfortunately, Leslie has another very important meeting right now. So if you have any other questions, you can just direct them towards me."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that accounting firm is gonna make me a job offer."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it pays well."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,"The commute is a little long, but that's okay."
Ben Wyatt,"I didn't love the carpeting, but eh."
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure about this?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how was the rally?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,We've lost the auction.
Ben Wyatt,So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or?
Ben Wyatt,That was That was Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,That was Kirk Gibson hobbling up to the plate and hitting a homer off of Dennis Eckersley.
Ben Wyatt,"Somebody swooped in at the last second, and now we're both screwed."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,That was a flu-ridden Michael Jordan at the '97 NBA finals.
Ben Wyatt,The Beatles.
Ben Wyatt,"Literally, there's someone reading a magazine, and someone applying nail Polish."
Ben Wyatt,I love you.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, honey."
Ben Wyatt,What's that what is she doing? She's just playing with an iPad.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, no, you're not."
Ben Wyatt,It's actually the Lamplighter.
Ben Wyatt,I'm getting it for her for waffle day.
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, you have a breakfast day too?"
Ben Wyatt,Mine's in June.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, imagine being married to her."
Ben Wyatt,"Everybody says they care about the issues, but at the end of the day, all anyone really wants is free clothing shot at them from a cannon."
Ben Wyatt,It's like being smothered with a hand quilted pillow filled with cherished memories.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's a common misconception that the Oculus holds all of the power."
Ben Wyatt,I told you I'm turning it down.
Ben Wyatt,"And to answer your question, sir, there will be sales-tax incentives this year."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,What is that? What are you supposed to do with that thing?
Ben Wyatt,Look at that thing.
Ben Wyatt,There's this video of a boat.
Ben Wyatt,"She's probably being paid upwards of 100,000 dollars a year."
Ben Wyatt,there's someone over there in a deep sleep.
Ben Wyatt,That chair that has a roof.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe I'm complaining about how thoughtful my wife is.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom told me that chair was 27,000 dollars."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's Excuse me."
Ben Wyatt,You're FutureMrsTigerWoods?
Ben Wyatt,"And, you know, you can still improve the city."
Ben Wyatt,Do it as a private citizen.
Ben Wyatt,I'll do it.
Ben Wyatt,I'm in.
Ben Wyatt,I've done enough exploring.
Ben Wyatt,I'm good.
Ben Wyatt,"She insists on trying it every time, and it never works."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,I don't even have time to tell you how wrong you are.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie, I need both you and Ron to sign this City Point of Sale document, since the land you're gunning for lies within city limits."
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, it's gonna bug me if I don't."
Ben Wyatt,"The Lannisters, while very wealthy, do not possess the magical abilities of, say, the warlocks of Qarth for example."
Ben Wyatt,"We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago, raccoons ate the wheels right off it."
Ben Wyatt,Can we run over to Ron's office and take care of this?
Ben Wyatt,Nothing's worked.
Ben Wyatt,We tried to clean up this neighborhood so many times.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Want some broccoli?
Ben Wyatt,Bye.
Ben Wyatt,"And now, a two second awkward silence after Leslie does her Rodney Dangerfield impression."
Ben Wyatt,"But the rest of the speech, fantastic."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, good idea."
Ben Wyatt,Let's call them.
Ben Wyatt,Or you know what else we could do?
Ben Wyatt,You really you need to stop giving these away like candy.
Ben Wyatt,You don't need five accountants.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, first thing you need to do: Get rid of four of those accountants."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I can hear you breathing, and, yes, you can finish her pasta."
Ben Wyatt,But we've talked about this.
Ben Wyatt,That was amazing.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you're doing fine."
Ben Wyatt,Should we move away from here?
Ben Wyatt,"You can't work right now, or run a campaign."
Ben Wyatt,You seem calmer than I expected you'd be.
Ben Wyatt,How are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so you're really gonna say no to Ann?"
Ben Wyatt,Want to bet?
Ben Wyatt,Watch what happens when she says
Ben Wyatt,"Everyone in the same room, at the same time."
Ben Wyatt,"It's what you wanted, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Just talk to them in person.
Ben Wyatt,Here's the best part.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,Are you chilly?
Ben Wyatt,What's the deal with her?
Ben Wyatt,She's married.
Ben Wyatt,I'm goodie goodie.
Ben Wyatt,"Pfft, nah."
Ben Wyatt,You all are great.
Ben Wyatt,"it was my idea, I'm totally in."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, counterpoint."
Ben Wyatt,"So when you use the word ""nerd"" derogatorily, means you'the one that's out of the zeitgeist."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, nerd culture is mainstream now."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, Donna and Joe are great."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you are aware that we've seen each other several times today."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, I am, babydoll."
Ben Wyatt,I think I do.
Ben Wyatt,Seems to be going the usual amount of gross.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, wait, before we get married, there is something we need to discuss."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we've never talked about it, but I really want you to take my last name."
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,"""We love each other."""
Ben Wyatt,"""You're my sexy roommate."""
Ben Wyatt,"You just do your thing, baby smurf."
Ben Wyatt,Is she gonna powder her vagina?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get some music and dancing going.
Ben Wyatt,There was probably a better way for you to tell us that.
Ben Wyatt,Nope.
Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Pinewood, Leslie's public health initiative has been a huge success."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,What are you Ah.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, we can get married May 16th, or June 1st, or July 57th."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, we're shutting this down."
Ben Wyatt,"But doesn't it feel right, today?"
Ben Wyatt,And I think I know what you're gonna say.
Ben Wyatt,"Give it to me, no"
Ben Wyatt,My head... Last night was so fun but my head... Died.
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,The universe is love.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe they're doing all this for me.
Ben Wyatt,They only bring him out for special occasions.
Ben Wyatt,Fred the Sled?
Ben Wyatt,"And I am Ben Wyatt, and I very much approve this message!"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,And this wedding is gonna to be amazing.
Ben Wyatt,That's a powerful metaphor.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, I just didn't get into it."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Where do I go?
Ben Wyatt,Con... I feel condifent.
Ben Wyatt,"Come to my office as soon as you're done, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I feel so good and condifent.
Ben Wyatt,The falcon is entering!
Ben Wyatt,I'm drunk.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, also, I have a little secret."
Ben Wyatt,"See, just thinking I'm a Congressman makes me feel like one."
Ben Wyatt,"I am, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Watch out for those riding lawnmowers, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you remember staying home sick from school watching the price is right?"
Ben Wyatt,"This is the right call, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,We air my ad.
Ben Wyatt,I'm I'm here.
Ben Wyatt,It's unanimous.
Ben Wyatt,We're not split.
Ben Wyatt,"Price Is Right is on, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"So, it's my understanding that despite what I said in our meeting, you have somehow increased your request for more school buses."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh I guess it's time for cake?"
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"You know when I first moved here, Iâ¦"
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I never gave miles Davis proper shrift.
Ben Wyatt,"""It's you, I love you."""
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
Ben Wyatt,"Because every day you come home and you're just like ""What?"""
Ben Wyatt,"But on to less grisly news, thank you for participating in our special founder's week public forum led by councilwoman Leslie Knope."
Ben Wyatt,"And I have to say, you know, getting married is the bravest, most wonderful thing you can do."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's just really important to me, symbolically, that Leslie Knope disappears and becomes Leslie Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, we, of course, are here to celebrate Donna and Joe."
Ben Wyatt,Or Councilwoman Mrs. Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,Chris and I used to slash budgets individually.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,It's a deal breaker.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,Are you talking to my butt?
Ben Wyatt,And thank you to Tom for that moving tribute to you.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I had to give it a shot."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey everybody, I'm Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,I'll toast it up.
Ben Wyatt,You want me to make a toast?
Ben Wyatt,And thank you to the Boys and Girls Club for the incredibly lifelike papier-mache statue.
Ben Wyatt,That's fine too.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, when he would do it by himself, nothing got done, and when I did it by myself, I'd get death threats."
Ben Wyatt,"Together, it seems to work."
Ben Wyatt,"The concert is canceled, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,Again?
Ben Wyatt,Damn it.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, that's all the questions for now."
Ben Wyatt,"So, for the introduction, I'd love it if you could just keep it brief."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,"I want to come out strong on education, then I'll tack hard into fiscal responsibility."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Like stick to my fiscal accomplishments.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, can we push the meeting an hour?"
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Ben Wyatt,I know I left you a message last night but I really do think you should have checked with me before throwing me into this.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Jen."
Ben Wyatt,Constantly.
Ben Wyatt,"We go to Bobby Newport, you apologize"
Ben Wyatt,Run!
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, guys, just hold it-- hold on a sec, okay? Mr. Feinstein, with all due respect you are a major dick."
Ben Wyatt,"This check is made out to ""Go [bleep] yourself."""
Ben Wyatt,You are gonna tell me everything there is to know about your mom.
Ben Wyatt,"And I'm gonna have another meeting with her, and we're gonna have it out."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, each department will be getting blue bins Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?"
Ben Wyatt,Watch what happens when I vote for Bobby Newport.
Ben Wyatt,I hope it doesn't affect your campaign.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, it's okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you so much for seeing us again, sir."
Ben Wyatt,We just came to apologize.
Ben Wyatt,Pants.
Ben Wyatt,I'm being honored at a gala tonight because I'm in charge of the Pawnee Bicentennial Celebration.
Ben Wyatt,"Cocktail party at the HayAdams, and I got us all on the list."
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I told the firemen they should use the lot as triage and then gave them and all the dead and wounded two free drink tickets."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, there's a swanky D.C."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I have a surprise for you."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. Feinstein, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,How'd it go?
Ben Wyatt,"And then we leak the details to the press, which restores your reputation and buys us enough time to finish the bus tour."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,This is extremely generous.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Ron went on Joan's show and kicked ass."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"It's my biggest project since Ice Town, so it really means a lot that I'm being recognized as a city leader instead of being yelled at and pelted with things."
Ben Wyatt,"You don't think this is all an elaborate setup to pelt me with things, do you?"
Ben Wyatt,I guess
Ben Wyatt,Why not?
Ben Wyatt,"How could she do this to-- Oh, God, I'm remembering things."
Ben Wyatt,The gala ends at 11:00.
Ben Wyatt,"At 11:01, we get married."
Ben Wyatt,Pawnee's rich and famous will all be here tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you start there.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"You need to get tougher, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,I'm running.
Ben Wyatt,"Jen posted the campaign ad, it's everywhere."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,We're now ninth.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I really don't wanna crush your childhood dreams, but I bet in your dreams you weren't losing an election by 70 points."
Ben Wyatt,Pawnee is no longer the fourth most obese city in America.
Ben Wyatt,Focus.
Ben Wyatt,I like you too.
Ben Wyatt,We did?
Ben Wyatt,This is my office.
Ben Wyatt,90 million dollars?
Ben Wyatt,Tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Let's get married.
Ben Wyatt,Let's just do it then.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to discuss the new school bus.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we only have three more months."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Well Let's just do it, then."
Ben Wyatt,"Let's get married Here, tonight."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we're all in black tie."
Ben Wyatt,"We've got plenty of food and entertainment And you did want to invite the whole town to the wedding, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Let's get married Tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,Um.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,God!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, should we just start over?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"We called Jen last night, didn't we?"
Ben Wyatt,"Deliverance, the movie?"
Ben Wyatt,You just have to.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Perfect timing.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, we need rings and marriage licenses."
Ben Wyatt,"No rings, just a tennis bracelet and a necklace that says ""Wine Chick."""
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,I think I'm feeling better.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, it's snowing."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,Mmmhmm.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey."
Ben Wyatt,Who?
Ben Wyatt,I can't see.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Li'l Sebastian?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,She thinks she's in Batman.
Ben Wyatt,How are you? How was the wedding?
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, you guys are really cute together."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I was on your show."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, I can."
Ben Wyatt,How did you know? I didn't even know.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I wasn't sure, but Leslie gave me the extra push, and I figured it'd be nice to put the ice town thing behind me once and for all."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,There's probably a compromise here.
Ben Wyatt,"It's a job doing inhouse accounting work for an accounting firm, so could be pretty interesting."
Ben Wyatt,"No, because he's been famously dead for 60 years."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it is, according to Andrew Carnegie."
Ben Wyatt,"But your demands remind me of a different quote, from the great Bill Watterson."
Ben Wyatt,"No, that doesn't apply."
Ben Wyatt,"Our lives are so busy, and if I won, I would be a Congressman or woman, I mean, equal rights."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, how would this even work?"
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,we've met.
Ben Wyatt,"""I'll get a saw."""
Ben Wyatt,"You know, if I hadn't resigned in disgrace, I might never have explored the private sector."
Ben Wyatt,Um What's that?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, me too."
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove?
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove.
Ben Wyatt,"It's like, why didn't I resign in disgrace 12 years ago?"
Ben Wyatt,Good call.
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove.
Ben Wyatt,That's the spirit.
Ben Wyatt,"Me, too!"
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Ms. Griggs-Knope."
Ben Wyatt,Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"It's succinct, it's punchy."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, people, this is an ad."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Could you, please, just get to the point?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I know what you're trying to do, and you're not that good at being sneaky."
Ben Wyatt,"No, you're not."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, she did say that."
Ben Wyatt,But no.
Ben Wyatt,"Clearly, you're not."
Ben Wyatt,She knew she wanted to be on TV when she was 10.
Ben Wyatt,"From the wedding ceremony, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,Don't.
Ben Wyatt,She's doing what?
Ben Wyatt,"So, what did you wanna be when you were 10?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you don't say."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"She got married, like, 20 minutes ago."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie gets the credit."
Ben Wyatt,"Just confirming a suspicion I had, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,You think?
Ben Wyatt,Sorry?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Orin's behind me, isn't he?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I think so."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, April."
Ben Wyatt,I'm staying here.
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Ben Wyatt,I already accepted the job.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,"So, not fine."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, well, well."
Ben Wyatt,I am not qualified for that.
Ben Wyatt,Like where... Like bills become laws.
Ben Wyatt,"Hang on, this is Congress you're talking about."
Ben Wyatt,"That's right, you were coming here tonight on a date."
Ben Wyatt,"And hey, Leslie is joining you on this wonderfully romantic occasion."
Ben Wyatt,How about that?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, hold on."
Ben Wyatt,Do you remember what Joan said at the ceremony?
Ben Wyatt,To do what?
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, we got you an autographed portrait of your personal hero."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I do want to apologize for not being able to accommodate some of your requests.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, come here."
Ben Wyatt,You have a condo in Seattle?
Ben Wyatt,How do you know that?
Ben Wyatt,They were yours.
Ben Wyatt,They were his.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,What is he on?
Ben Wyatt,I want candy.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I love it."
Ben Wyatt,I actually have to go too.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, hon."
Ben Wyatt,It's like worlds collide.
Ben Wyatt,Yikes.
Ben Wyatt,It's so great to see you too.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, when the Chamber of Commerce asked you to introduce me, I was a little worried you would spend the entire time talking about yourself, which is exactly what you did."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie and Dr. Clipperton Wow, man, I'm so glad you guys are meeting."
Ben Wyatt,I'm having twins!
Ben Wyatt,It's twins!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Ben Wyatt,Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?
Ben Wyatt,I'm serious.
Ben Wyatt,You're like a flower.
Ben Wyatt,"Or, no, like a snugbug or like a snuggerdoodle or something like that."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm making that speech, and I'm simply gonna explain to the crowd that love is everywhere and they have to surrender to the flow of the universe, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, this town expects me to wuss out."
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we're gonna talk about this now."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh, yikes."
Ben Wyatt,We need an officiant.
Ben Wyatt,"Or if you'd prefer, I could put a permanent freeze on the education budget."
Ben Wyatt,It's your call.
Ben Wyatt,Guys!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, but you know what you should see while you're here is George Washington's fare"
Ben Wyatt,But I just wanted to come wish you luck before your presentation.
Ben Wyatt,"I have, like, 1,000 meetings."
Ben Wyatt,That never happened.
Ben Wyatt,There's no backup cake.
Ben Wyatt,"And, um I got you something."
Ben Wyatt,Life.
Ben Wyatt,"We should just go for it, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,We're looking for a couple wedding rings.
Ben Wyatt,"For example, we couldn't get a bottle of Chateau Marmont because it's a hotel in Los Angeles, not a wine."
Ben Wyatt,"No, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Is that possible?
Ben Wyatt,So we didn't find any rings.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"God, we really could've used the money, though."
Ben Wyatt,Just wish we'd made a bigger impression.
Ben Wyatt,"That's very generous, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,Feinstein's the worst.
Ben Wyatt,I hope he gets into an accident driving that Rolex Mobile.
Ben Wyatt,Don't panic.
Ben Wyatt,I swear there's some rings in this old box of stuff my mom gave me.
Ben Wyatt,Still here at April and Andy's house.
Ben Wyatt,Want to come help me look?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you did convince three unsuspecting toddlers that peas turn into cupcakes in their tummies."
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,It's just not possible.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I still think Kevin James was a weird choice for the reboot."
Ben Wyatt,Ease back.
Ben Wyatt,"And don't even bother trying to outflank me either, because you will fail."
Ben Wyatt,And what do you think I should do?
Ben Wyatt,"Joan, on behalf of the entire city, congratulations."
Ben Wyatt,You got it.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Meagle, I presume."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm sorry Ms. Callahan."
Ben Wyatt,It was a pretty good speech.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it was a little sappy maybe."
Ben Wyatt,But I think I liked it.
Ben Wyatt,I think I'm giving birth.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Do I look sweat I feel oh, I need to use the bathroom one more time."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, I'm feeling sweaty."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Steph."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"It's not, just open it."
Ben Wyatt,I was the first one to tell you that?
Ben Wyatt,We're taking her to lunch now?
Ben Wyatt,Tastes like a belt.
Ben Wyatt,"So, what?"
Ben Wyatt,What could that possibly be good on?
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Ben Wyatt,Are you crying again?
Ben Wyatt,"Despite everything that happened 20 years ago, this will always be my hometown."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I hope that you are a podiatrist or a dentist because I seem to have a case of foot in mouth disorder."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I feel the same way about resigning in disgrace."
Ben Wyatt,"April, as requested, we threw that box you gave us into that volcano."
Ben Wyatt,Ron.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, as you requested, got you a three pack of white Tshirts from Target."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know why you jumped straight to model trains.
Ben Wyatt,I mean it's accurate.
Ben Wyatt,Is it?
Ben Wyatt,Gryzzl is not allowed to collect and use customer data for any purposes.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's also exactly right."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I should have thought of that.
Ben Wyatt,"I was just planning to introduce myself, nonmusically, and then, get everyone to refer to their packets."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Garry.
Ben Wyatt,"More good news, I finally found someone to be mayor."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's awesome."
Ben Wyatt,The lady who waxes you?
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Sounds like a good dude.
Ben Wyatt,So was he like a really great mayor?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, great."
Ben Wyatt,Walter Gunderson served Pawnee for 39 years.
Ben Wyatt,"And blah, blah, blah."
Ben Wyatt,"No, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,True.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Maggie Thatcher, let me help you with that."
Ben Wyatt,it's going to be a bumpy ride to this summit meeting.
Ben Wyatt,Our countries have a very special relationship.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that is very responsible and mature."
Ben Wyatt,So let's get to work.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,It's pretty clear.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, I've interviewed around, uh, but I'm actually about to take a job doing in-house accounting for an accounting firm."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I wanted to talk to you."
Ben Wyatt,Can we please just call it a day?
Ben Wyatt,"I just wanted to thank you so much for your help, Andy."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry we didn't wind up choosing the after school music program.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you tried, but I took a day off to spend with you, not with you and Jerry and a dead mayor."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I promise you I won't halfass this."
Ben Wyatt,You need to go over every single detail with me.
Ben Wyatt,You'll see.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's exactly right."
Ben Wyatt,"And as per his final wish, his body will lie in state, in the city council chambers for a day."
Ben Wyatt,Which is just a real cool thing for a public space.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, he sent us a brief video message to be played for this event."
Ben Wyatt,I like that Ice Town happened.
Ben Wyatt,Who knows where I'd be without it.
Ben Wyatt,"It led me to Pawnee, to my job, to Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,It set me on this path.
Ben Wyatt,"I spent so long trying to forget about Ice Town, but it's part of my life."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,I don't wanna do this.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I mean, you know, a situation could arise where you do something good, and I congratulate you."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, kind of like this."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that was really something."
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe I'm about to be the mayor.
Ben Wyatt,And no more visits from a masseuse or fancy lunches.
Ben Wyatt,It's way out of hand.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, ""Oh, congratulations."""
Ben Wyatt,"I know, and it's a huge waste of money."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, there's plenty of cheap office space around."
Ben Wyatt,And I have an idea for how to use some of the money we'll save.
Ben Wyatt,Please don't.
Ben Wyatt,"No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I just put on my Star Wars pajamas and sit in my mom's basement and pore over some spreadsheets."
Ben Wyatt,"No, of course."
Ben Wyatt,And I don't wanna erase it.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I would guess they'll be bankrupt by the end of This sentence."
Ben Wyatt,"If you don't mind me asking, how much are they paying you?"
Ben Wyatt,Are you the receptionist?
Ben Wyatt,"We went in with a day, figuring she'd counter with a month."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, hi."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is different from what I expected to find."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, I just wanted to tell you something in person."
Ben Wyatt,Where are we?
Ben Wyatt,Goodbye.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,We can figure out the photo later.
Ben Wyatt,Excellent.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, also, as President of the foundation, I'm making a few changes."
Ben Wyatt,I'm giving up this office.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"How would you like to be the next mayor of Pawnee, Indiana?"
Ben Wyatt,Garry Gergich.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we promised Leslie we'd prep for the meeting."
Ben Wyatt,Just no more fooling around at work.
Ben Wyatt,See?
Ben Wyatt,"Every year, there will be one day, ""Ann Day,"" where you can celebrate all of Ann's holidays and ""Ben Day"" where we can celebrate all of ours."
Ben Wyatt,But we have a compromise.
Ben Wyatt,Professional basketball players.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie, would you like to do the honors?"
Ben Wyatt,"Big, big news."
Ben Wyatt,Jean-Ralphio.
Ben Wyatt,Tom.
Ben Wyatt,It will speed things up.
Ben Wyatt,"Craig, can you sign the requisition form?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,What a surprise.
Ben Wyatt,"The government has been shut for two days, and one city employee has tried to schedule 14 meetings with me."
Ben Wyatt,Can you guess who?
Ben Wyatt,"No, there isn't."
Ben Wyatt,Happy waffle day.
Ben Wyatt,Everyone's gonna hate me again.
Ben Wyatt,"All of this work, everything I've done for this city, it's all a wash now."
Ben Wyatt,I'm thinking about it.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Kick his ass.
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Judge Perd."
Ben Wyatt,Can I ask you guys a question?
Ben Wyatt,How exactly are you making money?
Ben Wyatt,You should be upfront about what you're doing and allow people the ability to opt out.
Ben Wyatt,A person should not have to have an advanced law degree to avoid being taken advantage of by a multibillion dollar company.
Ben Wyatt,"And I think you do know that data-mining isn't chill, because you snuck it into the 27th update of a 500-page user agreement."
Ben Wyatt,"Add a line at the end about how you're pro business, and we'll deal with the fallout tomorrow, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I need to see all of your books.
Ben Wyatt,What's the matter with you?
Ben Wyatt,"This has to stop, right now."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,You're welcome.
Ben Wyatt,You can't just print your own money.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the Internet is no longer optional."
Ben Wyatt,Selfish?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we kind of do."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,I'm running a charity.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, screw it."
Ben Wyatt,"What Gryzzl is doing with our private information may not technically be illegal, but it's definitely not chill."
Ben Wyatt,Go get him.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager."
Ben Wyatt,It's a necessity for everyone.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, Pawnee is broke."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,Are you Did you forget the Did you Can I get that thing?
Ben Wyatt,It's Ice Town all over again.
Ben Wyatt,So we can't access the computers.
Ben Wyatt,It's my fault.
Ben Wyatt,I did this to the town.
Ben Wyatt,And none of us has a login.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, everything is paperless now."
Ben Wyatt,"Can we just, uh Did you bring it?"
Ben Wyatt,This isn't convincing.
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Eleanor likes the tongue.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, show me Pelosi again."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, thanks for texting me to hang out."
Ben Wyatt,"I've really felt like we've developed a cool friendship, and anyway, it was just nice to have that validated."
Ben Wyatt,How did I miss this?
Ben Wyatt,It says here they can gather and use any information they want.
Ben Wyatt,She took it well?
Ben Wyatt,Why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone?
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, you're just who I was looking for."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, JeanRalphio."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, the guy at the plaque store thought you had died."
Ben Wyatt,"It was a rush job, so we didn't have time to change it."
Ben Wyatt,But Ann and I wanted to tell you that this is the last Breakfast Day and Waffle Day we'll be celebrating.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, Idaho cut their Parks Department by 80%, and Idaho is basically one giant park."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, why couldn't Donna do it?"
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, guys."
Ben Wyatt,Listen.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie's gonna walk in and say something that sounds very boring, but is actually a really big deal."
Ben Wyatt,"No, Pawnee is not special."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,There's no money for a concert.
Ben Wyatt,"Your department, all the way down here, is not a priority."
Ben Wyatt,You're non-essential.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hey."
Ben Wyatt,"I know, it's on your badge."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,"So when I give the signal, just, everybody, cheer like crazy."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that went roughly as well as I thought it would."
Ben Wyatt,Here we go.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"And frankly, you're not even supposed to be in the building, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,And I think we should make an attack ad against Bobby Newport.
Ben Wyatt,If you want to just jump right in.
Ben Wyatt,I'll handle the general outline.
Ben Wyatt,True.
Ben Wyatt,In Washington.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,"So, you were born in the 1990s?"
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,We'll cover your duties here.
Ben Wyatt,You should just take the rest of the day off.
Ben Wyatt,Oh my God.
Ben Wyatt,"That's so nice, that's so nice."
Ben Wyatt,"That's okay, right?"
Ben Wyatt,I have no idea.
Ben Wyatt,He plays for the Pacers.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, go home."
Ben Wyatt,Jen offered me a job working on a congressional campaign
Ben Wyatt,"With current and projected deficits, we need to cut expenditures by 32%."
Ben Wyatt,Should I change my Brita filter?
Ben Wyatt,That's not necessary.
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, what's a good place to buy jeans?"
Ben Wyatt,Are you happy or angry?
Ben Wyatt,Which one is that?
Ben Wyatt,Commerce.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, so that's what the hug was all about."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but does it have to be this family?"
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a good point.
Ben Wyatt,"Away from you, but you know, we should talk about it."
Ben Wyatt,"I have to say, The Douche, I'm skeptical that your interest is sincere."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it sounds amazing, but you know, six months in Washington, D.C."
Ben Wyatt,""" I haven't had a chance to think about it."
Ben Wyatt,I turned down that accounting job.
Ben Wyatt,Just didn't feel right.
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,It's great to see you George.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,That's fine.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,I was just congratulating her because she got some good news.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Jerry was never really the type to rise above mediocrity or to it."
Ben Wyatt,"No, there's no money."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"We were both kind of up for this thing, this really"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,We are David.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,It's nothing.
Ben Wyatt,She she's nothing.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"No, you were perfect."
Ben Wyatt,That's an actual NBA player.
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,Your eyes are glassy.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, I guess I'll just see you at home."
Ben Wyatt,But it's illegal.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, I think you should go in alone."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Bobby."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for coming in.
Ben Wyatt,City Councilor.
Ben Wyatt,Steady.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, no."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Choosing to ignore what you just said, we need an interim mayor, just for two months."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"And given your family name and how well liked you are, I thought you might be interested."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,You're burning up.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you take pictures of that?
Ben Wyatt,I thought we had a meeting.
Ben Wyatt,Are you leaving?
Ben Wyatt,"No, I just yeah, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,"And now, here to say a few words is Mayor Gunderson's longtime friend and coworker, Ethel Beavers."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,My Brita filter's older than their relationship.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,All that's left is the waiting.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, uh--"
Ben Wyatt,We're done.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, relax."
Ben Wyatt,Nothing.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Finished both of them last night.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, please."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, that's how it works."
Ben Wyatt,How are you feeling?
Ben Wyatt,Did you make your dadcision yet?
Ben Wyatt,Are you asking me or telling me?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as your CFO, I recommend getting rid of her immediately."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, when I was in high school, we had to spend a week carrying around a sack of flour, pretending it was a kid."
Ben Wyatt,"Why don't you make Tom your sack of flour, see how it feels to parent him a little?"
Ben Wyatt,"One if you win, one if you lose."
Ben Wyatt,Been calling your office trying to set up a debate.
Ben Wyatt,Well.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Now will you help me find someone?
Ben Wyatt,They're just a company.
Ben Wyatt,It can be anyone over the age of 30 who's a good symbolic face for the town.
Ben Wyatt,They're not that powerful.
Ben Wyatt,Those are really fun.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I told Garry he could help too.
Ben Wyatt,There are pictures.
Ben Wyatt,There are lots of pictures.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you not throw these away or incinerate them?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, sure."
Ben Wyatt,I'll take a look.
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,What you right now?
Ben Wyatt,Uh. I have work.
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, I could use someone to help me at the foundation as a part-time assistant but also an idea man."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, they also have a squadron of flying robots giving presents to everyone."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I said we all remember."
Ben Wyatt,I've seen you beat tougher odds than this.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, break evens?"
Ben Wyatt,Sounds great.
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,what'd you got?
Ben Wyatt,"We take all our money, we air a TV ad right at halftime."
Ben Wyatt,"So, you're in good hands."
Ben Wyatt,How did you already have these?
Ben Wyatt,"Now, in this town it's bigger than the super bowl."
Ben Wyatt,"No, the Pawnee Eagleton high school basketball game."
Ben Wyatt,I can hear you.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, April."
Ben Wyatt,This is our slingshot.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, as city manager, I'm in charge of appointing an interim mayor until the special election."
Ben Wyatt,Newport is goliath.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"I didn't find the article about you teaching sex ed to seniors, but I did find this folder labeled ""Senior sex ed thank you notes."""
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I was a mayor once before."
Ben Wyatt,We all remember how that went.
Ben Wyatt,"Good attitude, honey."
Ben Wyatt,Will you help me out with something?
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for coming in.
Ben Wyatt,"I've done presentations like this before, and Tom will be with me."
Ben Wyatt,And it is not Tom
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, exactly."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,They must be datamining.
Ben Wyatt,Searching our texts and emails and gathering profiles on all of us.
Ben Wyatt,"This is a huge invasion of privacy, not to mention illegal."
Ben Wyatt,"When they installed their free WiFi in town, I made sure that there was language preventing this."
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,It'll be good for you.
Ben Wyatt,So it's really just a coffee sales app.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, then, who's your doctor?"
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,They are?
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Ben Wyatt,There's got to be someone.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Think.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, come on."
Ben Wyatt,Ah.
Ben Wyatt,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,"""Had to""?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'll help with anything."
Ben Wyatt,A thousand?
Ben Wyatt,"Look, don't worry."
Ben Wyatt,Ben and Leslie's day off.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, Andy, it's you."
Ben Wyatt,I think you may have a knack for charitable giving.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go relax.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"What No, Andy, I've already chosen the person."
Ben Wyatt,Will you come work for me? Uh-oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, you've worked nonstop."
Ben Wyatt,What's happening? Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Holidays and weekends.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, open that box they sent you."
Ben Wyatt,MonaLisa Saperstein?
Ben Wyatt,Does that mean
Ben Wyatt,You're just gonna take a day off.
Ben Wyatt,I'm making us a mac and cheese pizza for
Ben Wyatt,Just promise we'll do it quickly.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's your fever."
Ben Wyatt,Here's what we're gonna do.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, miss Knope is a candidate for city council."
Ben Wyatt,But you're the cutest.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, uh, I've been in government accounting for more than a decade, and I just think it's time for a change."
Ben Wyatt,So just open the box.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, then I'll just open the box for you."
Ben Wyatt,I figured it out a while ago.
Ben Wyatt,Hmm!
Ben Wyatt,Looks like Newport Trust is making an announcement.
Ben Wyatt,Huh.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's force of habit."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks for coming, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm super swamped, and I need your help."
Ben Wyatt,Tom Haverford.
Ben Wyatt,"""I love you."""
Ben Wyatt,"""You are a true inspiration to me."""
Ben Wyatt,"""When I think of success, I think of you."""
Ben Wyatt,You came down here to pass on helping me?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Tom, glad you could make it."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, I think she's doing a little better than okay."
Ben Wyatt,You have a nice day with your spa buddies?
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, are you okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, I know Ann."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,"I thought what we could talk about is how fast you could get there using an airplane, a train or a car."
Ben Wyatt,"Now as you can see, the airplane is the fastest."
Ben Wyatt,"I can't let you do this, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"We're stating facts about him, and, yeah, they happen to be negative because he's a bonehead."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this just seals the deal."
Ben Wyatt,"Washington's really far away, and I don't know if I want to work with Jen."
Ben Wyatt,It's just a list of facts.
Ben Wyatt,It's not a negative ad.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I was on the fence about it anyway."
Ben Wyatt,"That would be really fun, but it's impossible."
Ben Wyatt,Easy.
Ben Wyatt,Teleportation is impossible.
Ben Wyatt,It's about theoretical physics.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, then I won't go."
Ben Wyatt,You asked me to do this.
Ben Wyatt,This was a favor--
Ben Wyatt,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, maybe I'll do that."
Ben Wyatt,Or did you miss the applause she got on the raccoon safety question?
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Ed who who's Eddie?
Ben Wyatt,Why don't you just Photoshop that out?
Ben Wyatt,Do you have to say that every time?
Ben Wyatt,Don't you even want to win the debate?
Ben Wyatt,We have to break up.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie, everything you've accomplished, you have earned and you have worked for."
Ben Wyatt,I don't want anyone to think that you got where you are today by sleeping with your boss.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,What do you need a computer fan for?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,What's that?
Ben Wyatt,Why don't we sit down.
Ben Wyatt,Please.
Ben Wyatt,Please.
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,"For the love of all that is holy, both of you, please, sign this form."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, listen, I've been thinking."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Jen Barkley offered me a job in Washington."
Ben Wyatt,"Gin and tonic, please."
Ben Wyatt,But I just I wanted this to last as long as possible.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, I'm in."
Ben Wyatt,"A great job, but I think Leslie wants me to stay."
Ben Wyatt,"I have to pick our first charity by tomorrow, and there's a million applications."
Ben Wyatt,Can you guys help me sort 'em out?
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you're so casual about this.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they bring me fancy lunches here."
Ben Wyatt,"If you stay, you can have some."
Ben Wyatt,Heyuh!
Ben Wyatt,Then good luck to the both of us.
Ben Wyatt,"But if Leslie wins, you get my old job, assistant city manager, right?"
Ben Wyatt,So you really want things to just stay exactly the same?
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you, Johnny, are moving to Washington, D.C."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, all the permits cleared for the horse funeral."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,I'm very sad about this.
Ben Wyatt,Why don't you just tell me what you're thinking.
Ben Wyatt,"I am your chief strategist, so I'm sure we can work it out."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you have a vision of how your campaign should go."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, here's a question, do you like the idea?"
Ben Wyatt,You do?
Ben Wyatt,What would you do?
Ben Wyatt,I should've told you I knew.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Today we're going to learn about geography.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, kids."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, listen, I don't know if you got my email, but I thought since this is our final show, maybe we not use the Boring Buzzer."
Ben Wyatt,Did you take my advice?
Ben Wyatt,It's going to cost an arm and a leg.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey Ann, how's it going."
Ben Wyatt,This is incredible.
Ben Wyatt,And look at that art.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I am not--"
Ben Wyatt,I'm also curious about how it's going.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,I really like helping people.
Ben Wyatt,They got Annabel Porter to be the celebrity face of their group.
Ben Wyatt,Running the new Sweetums Foundation charity allows me to do that and work in an office with more mahogany wood than currently remains in the Amazon rain forest.
Ben Wyatt,That's well within the margin for a recount.
Ben Wyatt,"So, win win."
Ben Wyatt,Except for the rain forest.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, there's even a rumor going around that the chocolate is made of rat parts."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,I cannot believe the weird notary hell I've been trapped in.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, you're not thinking clearly."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God you're still here."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's try this again."
Ben Wyatt,All pages accounted for.
Ben Wyatt,Just sign right here.
Ben Wyatt,"Again, I don't want to talk about her plan with you, nor yours with her."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure you understand.
Ben Wyatt,I was wondering if you could help me out.
Ben Wyatt,"Terry, come on!"
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,Where is she?
Ben Wyatt,Including the rat thing?
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,"They said the recount could take two hours, but who knows."
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,Now I'm not leaving until you make the call.
Ben Wyatt,It's the law.
Ben Wyatt,"Commissioner, the recount has to start immediately."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,Mr.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I think Leslie should say something to the troops just to get everyone's spirits up."
Ben Wyatt,Not that it matters.
Ben Wyatt,She drew a kiss monster on the note.
Ben Wyatt,Newport won by 21 votes.
Ben Wyatt,You too.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"I thought we locked those vans down, like, a week ago."
Ben Wyatt,Time you delivered her mail.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, we get it."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Feinstein."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll counter with 100 bucks."
Ben Wyatt,What if they don't?
Ben Wyatt,And you guys are all on board with this.
Ben Wyatt,Who is it?
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you said your new landlord didn't give you a chance to counter."
Ben Wyatt,500 bucks.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, all right."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I have to ask this, I'm sorry, but how many legs did that dog have when you found him?"
Ben Wyatt,That is a three legged dog.
Ben Wyatt,I'll stay.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Johnny."
Ben Wyatt,Uh-huh.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, Gayle looks amazing."
Ben Wyatt,"How about we do this, we split up into teams, we each make a demo version of our ad."
Ben Wyatt,Why are you laughing?
Ben Wyatt,There's a recount.
Ben Wyatt,Recount!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, we don't, you know, we just like to work in the same place."
Ben Wyatt,and then we talk and hold hands.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it sounded bad when I said it."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Nope.
Ben Wyatt,Different thing.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I do--"
Ben Wyatt,I saw that you recently won an auction for the JJ's diner waffle iron.
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to buy it.
Ben Wyatt,You and everyone else.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, go down there and get those vans back."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Who are you?
Ben Wyatt,Eh.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,They spelled his name wrong on the tombstone.
Ben Wyatt,Whichever one we like better we use.
Ben Wyatt,And I'd like to that's it right there.
Ben Wyatt,How would you feel about going in on the waffle iron together?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I think I may have a plan that'll get us out of breakfast day and waffle day and all the other days without making us seem like ungrateful people who are annoyed at how amazing Leslie is."
Ben Wyatt,I'm definitely going to wake up tomorrow morning with the same forms for you to sign.
Ben Wyatt,You drove here.
Ben Wyatt,I am?
Ben Wyatt,And say what?
Ben Wyatt,"So, April's still on the fence about kids, huh?"
Ben Wyatt,We didn't plan for this.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, I just thought you might want to talk."
Ben Wyatt,What would you even say?
Ben Wyatt,Sometimes I think they're somehow the first humans who don't need sleep.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Andy, why don't you give me a hand in the kitchen?"
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Ben Wyatt,No kids at all.
Ben Wyatt,It's just us grownups tonight.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, they're trick-or-treating in Georgetown with some friends."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm sorry."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, what?"
Ben Wyatt,"Gameplay Magazine called it ""punishingly intricate."""
Ben Wyatt,"And I am the Lamplighter, a character from my new board game sequel, Cones of Dunshire, Winds of Tremorrah."
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I just closed a big donation to the Redwood Music Program, a charity he discovered, so I suggested we all go out for a celebratory drink."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,And somehow I just ended up becoming the designated driver.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, do you have to run that right now?"
Ben Wyatt,Of course not.
Ben Wyatt,"Maybe we should get, like, a suite here for them, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,It's Andy's day.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"Then, yes, knight me, please."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, this is amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Winter is coming for Ser Ben Lightstorm.
Ben Wyatt,But we've run out of options.
Ben Wyatt,What is that?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I know how valuable she is, believe me."
Ben Wyatt,"If we're gonna stop them, and you're gonna beat them on the Newport land, we need more ammo."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just sorry we couldn't find something illegal on Gryzzl.
Ben Wyatt,"So, seems like the best option is job cuts."
Ben Wyatt,"And thanks to Ron, the services budget has already been cut significantly."
Ben Wyatt,They sound kinda crappy to me.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,I should be more assertive.
Ben Wyatt,And I didn't get to choose the bar.
Ben Wyatt,And paying for everyone.
Ben Wyatt,Starting with Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Ben Wyatt,It's called Rural Ambucare.
Ben Wyatt,That sounds perfect.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's talk about Parks and Rec."
Ben Wyatt,The latest poll has us only two points behind Bobby Newport!
Ben Wyatt,"As I suspected, airtight."
Ben Wyatt,"And after you fell asleep making Jerry's scrapbook, I went back to season one of Fringe to check for plot holes."
Ben Wyatt,It's all right.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is a great service that will help a lot of needy people."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Andy."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, right."
Ben Wyatt,So you can put that one away.
Ben Wyatt,I think we got through it.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, deep breath."
Ben Wyatt,It's totally fine.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, congratulations."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,I love you too.
Ben Wyatt,"To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of Peter Jackson's interpretation."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, while you were over at Jerry's, did you happen to get any information about his history with Gayle?"
Ben Wyatt,This one is a little complicated.
Ben Wyatt,"I don't think it's Jimmy Carter, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,"Like, was she a Russian spy and the KGB forced her to marry Jerry as a cover?"
Ben Wyatt,They want to buy an ambulance for people who live far away from the hospital.
Ben Wyatt,"I thought I wanted to branch out a little careerwise, but that was a mistake."
Ben Wyatt,That's a fact.
Ben Wyatt,It looks like there are some tiny initials.
Ben Wyatt,Come on in.
Ben Wyatt,"Unless you start working on an actual plan, you're dead in a month."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you guys can swagger around all you want, but businesses need revenue, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Keep Eddie.
Ben Wyatt,I do not want this job.
Ben Wyatt,Think I have our winner.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"And two, you have to keep detailed financial records."
Ben Wyatt,"""J.C?"""
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you don't need this airplane hangar"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, if you want this company to survive, you immediately need to downsize."
Ben Wyatt,Just go with the closing statement we rehearsed.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, does she think Jerry is a friendly hat?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, maybe Gayle has one of those Oliver Sacks brain disorder thingies?"
Ben Wyatt,It keeps me awake at night.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I can't."
Ben Wyatt,It's too risky.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but you're the candidate."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"What, you trust me with a congressional campaign?"
Ben Wyatt,"I know it's hard to hear that, but You're boring, and frankly you disgust me."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's gonna be really hard, and we could still get fired."
Ben Wyatt,Echh!
Ben Wyatt,This is like when the triplets fight except I can't just give Leslie and Ron stuffed animals to make them calm down.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, that might work."
Ben Wyatt,Have we tried that?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,You okay?
Ben Wyatt,I know you're furious at him.
Ben Wyatt,"But please, come to a neutral site and sit with Ron for 30 seconds so I can get this dumb document signed."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"I'll let you rename the triplets Ruth, Bader, and Ginsburg."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,Let me get that for you.
Ben Wyatt,Got them!
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,You guys are being ridiculous.
Ben Wyatt,"This has gone too far, and you are not leaving this office until you've made peace."
Ben Wyatt,I just don't like you anymore.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not ready for a commitment.
Ben Wyatt,This is your pick?
Ben Wyatt,They provide legal assistance to the KKK.
Ben Wyatt,Because I've died somehow and now I'm a ghost living in purgatory until I complete my unfinished business.
Ben Wyatt,"Side note, I would again strongly recommend adding calzones to the menu."
Ben Wyatt,All the numbers line up.
Ben Wyatt,But you've done your homework.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there are always going to be risks when you open new restaurants."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Andy."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, just put it aside, and I'll read it later."
Ben Wyatt,Can you at least call me Ben?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm a congressman, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,Don't fire Eddie.
Ben Wyatt,Did you just hear what I said?
Ben Wyatt,Because I'm a ghost.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I wouldn't open with that."
Ben Wyatt,Stop talking.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, it's not you, it's me."
Ben Wyatt,That's a great idea.
Ben Wyatt,Anyone else come across anything good?
Ben Wyatt,Tom?
Ben Wyatt,"No, of course you didn't."
Ben Wyatt,Is this a trick?
Ben Wyatt,Why would you have him in here in this interview?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Ben Wyatt,"I have so many presents, it's weird."
Ben Wyatt,Where do I put these?
Ben Wyatt,"I know it came unexpectedly early, but pretty cool he was born in Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,"Congrats, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"And the town has really nice blond hair, too, and has read a shocking number of political biographies for a town, which I like."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Fitting, really."
Ben Wyatt,How much?
Ben Wyatt,"What, you want to break up?"
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, you're really burning up."
Ben Wyatt,"You, too."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that sounds great, but the Pacers called, and they're asking me to be their starting point guard."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,To whom?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Hang on.
Ben Wyatt,Can you actually do this?
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"It was simple, but I liked it."
Ben Wyatt,"Granted, you always do that, but they got really specific and moving."
Ben Wyatt,"He was always enthusiastic, but he also kept track of his appointments by writing them on his arm."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,Doors are locked.
Ben Wyatt,Just burn it and bury the ashes and pray it doesn't haunt you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then You want to tell Chris."
Ben Wyatt,We've taken your keycards and your phones and the automatic timer won't go off until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.
Ben Wyatt,You're trapped in there.
Ben Wyatt,Good stuff.
Ben Wyatt,What are you talking about?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, there was a dude in the ladies' yacht club."
Ben Wyatt,"Eddie, I am sorry"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, our baby monitor is on the table."
Ben Wyatt,"If you guys can talk this out and settle your differences like grownups, turn it on and I will come to get you from my office."
Ben Wyatt,"Otherwise, we will see you at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I find it a little insulting that you don't trust me to handle this."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Also, you've been making campaign speeches in your sleep."
Ben Wyatt,He then became a bureaucratic assistant.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, honey."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, it makes sense if you've read the books."
Ben Wyatt,I'll have the same.
Ben Wyatt,"""You need a lobotomy."""
Ben Wyatt,The meeting's at 2:00?
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,I think this might be a dead end.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,They're going to develop a great rivalry.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Chris, hypothetical crisis."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie just tried to answer a question and audibly farted then threw up.
Ben Wyatt,Spin.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it's Kate Upton.
Ben Wyatt,It was.
Ben Wyatt,"Here, I'll show you my Claymation project, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I've sunk myself into my hobbies.
Ben Wyatt,What does that mean?
Ben Wyatt,How's your head?
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, JJ."
Ben Wyatt,You're the best.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Pizza?
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,Nice.
Ben Wyatt,My friend Jack and I used to fish this lake in the summer.
Ben Wyatt,Andy
Ben Wyatt,"One time, our boat almost tipped over, but then it didn't."
Ben Wyatt,Your job would be to preserve the most beautiful places on earth so millions of people could enjoy them.
Ben Wyatt,"And those places, the greatest treasures America has to offer, will all have signs with your name right there."
Ben Wyatt,There is one thing that you will be doing.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, that's probably what it was."
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, in Indiana, if you don't provide a basketball league, people get very upset."
Ben Wyatt,"And quite frankly, throw things at you and call you names."
Ben Wyatt,Like Turdboy.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, what do I do?"
Ben Wyatt,"My choice almost killed us, and we can't agree on another one, so"
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it has to be from Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Huh.
Ben Wyatt,"Smoothly handled, Lester."
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,I just know that's what Leslie wants.
Ben Wyatt,He has?
Ben Wyatt,"Ugh, forget it."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,The point is I reinstated youth basketball.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, if this gets out, every time you want to do anything, some guy's gonna come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, that's boring."
Ben Wyatt,"But more importantly, we change the idea of what a pie is."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, picture this... Crust on the bottom."
Ben Wyatt,Filling.
Ben Wyatt,"Small town called Partridge, Minnesota."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, the relocation package seems fair, but the dental plan is more than fair."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, three annual cleanings for the spouse?"
Ben Wyatt,Kaching.
Ben Wyatt,Crust on top.
Ben Wyatt,What am I describing?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"But you're in the right ""zone."""
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, back up!"
Ben Wyatt,Calzone!
Ben Wyatt,"Pies are just sweet calzones, honey."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm good at making calzones.
Ben Wyatt,I can win this thing.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, we're dead."
Ben Wyatt,Back it up!
Ben Wyatt,It's over.
Ben Wyatt,Exactly.
Ben Wyatt,Uh Go forward!
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what happened to, ""A perfect encapsulation of life in Pawnee""?"
Ben Wyatt,"I have, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"It was a setup, wasn't it?"
Ben Wyatt,Never heard of it.
Ben Wyatt,"That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,"So, what kind of building is it?"
Ben Wyatt,"She also wants ""passionate interest in subject matter."""
Ben Wyatt,"So far, so good."
Ben Wyatt,"Soon, maybe a month."
Ben Wyatt,"You just don't do the pie contest, obviously."
Ben Wyatt,They were gonna make fun of me?
Ben Wyatt,"This whole region-- Mount Rushmore, the Badlands, the Ozarks, Abe Lincoln's childhood home you would be in charge of all of it."
Ben Wyatt,I'm not faffing around.
Ben Wyatt,"""Get to be my own boss."""
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Go forward!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, he's not here."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, how about this?"
Ben Wyatt,What if I register for the contest?
Ben Wyatt,I bake the pie.
Ben Wyatt,He took off.
Ben Wyatt,I act as my own wife.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Have you ever wondered why there isn't a fast food option for Italian food?
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, I've been working pretty hard on this, and I think it's really good."
Ben Wyatt,"I even got an extra whipped cream can, one for baking, one for directly into mouth."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Go, go, go, go, go."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, there's fast food hamburgers."
Ben Wyatt,How about some music?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, sorry, it was symbolic."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you know what then?"
Ben Wyatt,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Mexican.
Ben Wyatt,And consulting is perfect for April.
Ben Wyatt,But they recently opened up a consulting wing.
Ben Wyatt,"Mm, let me see the key."
Ben Wyatt,You could debate Newport in your sleep.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's an accounting firm.
Ben Wyatt,You made up your mind yesterday.
Ben Wyatt,You-- Michelle Obama.
Ben Wyatt,"So just hang on to your hat, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,I got everything you need for pie domination.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"Glad you asked, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Awesome.
Ben Wyatt,4 feet. Exact same size as the podium you use in the Parks department.
Ben Wyatt,Opening statement.
Ben Wyatt,Ron subbed for you on Pawnee Today.
Ben Wyatt,Oh listen to this.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, get your normal conversation in with me while you can."
Ben Wyatt,"""Dear Quiet Corn, thank you for your beautiful inn. My wife and I spent three nights of ecstasy in this room."""
Ben Wyatt,You got this.
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread."
Ben Wyatt,We sleep in the same bed.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's all over the Internet-- Austin, Charlotte, San Diego."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'll look into that, but at least because of it, Pawnee will get free wireless, and we can both move away with a clear conscience."
Ben Wyatt,Uh-oh.
Ben Wyatt,What's wrong?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how's it going?"
Ben Wyatt,Got about 20 minutes before I get all loopy again.
Ben Wyatt,Kate works at the Pentagon and Lacey works for Eric Cantor.
Ben Wyatt,Where the hell am I?
Ben Wyatt,"So, how's it going?"
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,And I have you.
Ben Wyatt,Focus on what it actually means.
Ben Wyatt,We're standing in a national park that stretches 50 miles.
Ben Wyatt,Daddy want pie.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,Where did you get that?
Ben Wyatt,#NAME?
Ben Wyatt,That's the Presidio over there.
Ben Wyatt,"The bad news, which I get to deliver, is this."
Ben Wyatt,Your only work for the time being will be existing park maintenance.
Ben Wyatt,It's a national park.
Ben Wyatt,Blah blah blah.
Ben Wyatt,"So is Alcatraz, and so are the redwoods we just walked through, by the way."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I had a pretty uneventful childhood."
Ben Wyatt,"So, that just means that we're in maintenance mode."
Ben Wyatt,"So, Dennis, not to interrupt"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"You take this job, places like this will be your office."
Ben Wyatt,"When we got back from London, you said that it's a very big world and you've seen very little of it."
Ben Wyatt,"This is your chance, honey."
Ben Wyatt,You've been thinking about this job in the abstract.
Ben Wyatt,"Chop chop, time to get bakin'."
Ben Wyatt,Look at this.
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, the oven's ready."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I mean, I love Partridge, but I have Pawnee now."
Ben Wyatt,Drive here.
Ben Wyatt,It's been hell.
Ben Wyatt,There's no way.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it's not you.
Ben Wyatt,But I don't want this.
Ben Wyatt,You're going to destroy him.
Ben Wyatt,You're the best wife in the world.
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to wipe the floor with his face.
Ben Wyatt,I have an idea.
Ben Wyatt,You're going to rip out his spine with your teeth and then chew it up and gargle with it.
Ben Wyatt,Just trust me.
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,I'm on Endor.
Ben Wyatt,These are the redwoods George Lucas used to create the forest moon of Endor.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Chinese.
Ben Wyatt,That's not why we're here.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it is."
Ben Wyatt,But don't look at that.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's right up here."
Ben Wyatt,"Seriously, can you do his TV show?"
Ben Wyatt,"What I'm talking about is a portable, delicious meal, that is it's own container."
Ben Wyatt,Turn around!
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, no."
Ben Wyatt,Godspeed.
Ben Wyatt,I love you.
Ben Wyatt,I did cry last time.
Ben Wyatt,Fair point.
Ben Wyatt,No worries.
Ben Wyatt,"No offense, Ron, but I don't think you'd be great on TV."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie was gonna go on Pawnee Today to promote the gala.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,"No one asks me, ""Where are your kids?"" Or, ""Who's taking care of them?"" By the way, who is taking care of the kids right now?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, get some chairs from somewhere."
Ben Wyatt,"If you talk to her directly and honestly, she can be surprisingly open minded."
Ben Wyatt,"Donna, are we on schedule for the tent setup?"
Ben Wyatt,"And by the way, no one's ever asked me that question."
Ben Wyatt,"I spilled it, but you know how it goes."
Ben Wyatt,You know what happened?
Ben Wyatt,"April, I told you that was an absurd idea."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I'm feeding your eagle.
Ben Wyatt,He's starving.
Ben Wyatt,This is the copyright to Cones of Dunshire.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, pack your suitcases, because we're going to a little town, Called Napoli In Italy."
Ben Wyatt,This is amazing.
Ben Wyatt,That's beautiful.
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, free me from what?"
Ben Wyatt,Did the Dalai Lama say that?
Ben Wyatt,How can I ever repay you?
Ben Wyatt,It's a whole new spin on Italian fast casual dining.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hang on."
Ben Wyatt,Why isn't the other candidate's wife being scrutinized like this?
Ben Wyatt,And you of all people will like this.
Ben Wyatt,We could organize a black tie gala with food and music and maybe a silent auction to raise money.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"No, sorry."
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna use low fat ingredients.
Ben Wyatt,I can't.
Ben Wyatt,"And I will call my new Italian fast casual eatery ""The Lowcal Calzone Zone."""
Ben Wyatt,"Right, some of that is possible."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,What if we register for the park instead of the stuff?
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to introduce yourself every time.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Any time your name comes up, I panic and change the subject to the Twin Peaks reboot until she gets bored."
Ben Wyatt,What Who was that?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I think I know what's going on in your head."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the cost of living is way lower here, and renting the entire third floor of this building would be way cheaper than a much smaller space in Chicago."
Ben Wyatt,With my Claymaish?
Ben Wyatt,Good afternoon.
Ben Wyatt,I'm here today to share with you all my vision for the economic future of Southern Indiana.
Ben Wyatt,"But first, Leslie Knope, my wife, has a brief statement."
Ben Wyatt,The financial savings here are enormous.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, hang on."
Ben Wyatt,Stop.
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, this whole thing just makes me queasy."
Ben Wyatt,"I love how independent my wife is, and because of that, I will not let her speak."
Ben Wyatt,That came out wrong.
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, Leslie is a great mother, public servant, all-around person, and I am tired of everybody constantly telling her that she's making the wrong choice."
Ben Wyatt,Good to see you.
Ben Wyatt,"So you can say whatever you want, I couldn't care less about the political consequences."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,What are you talking about?
Ben Wyatt,Kind of tearing this Claymation video a new one right now.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, thanks, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,Ladies' yacht club?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,I'm Mr.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I can't keep your secret much longer."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Ben Wyatt,Apologize for what?
Ben Wyatt,You need to tell Leslie that you want to leave your job.
Ben Wyatt,Opening statement.
Ben Wyatt,You're going to spend the next couple of days with her.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Go, go, go, go, go."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, in that case, yes, I am."
Ben Wyatt,To Donna and Joe.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I talked Newport's people into giving us ten minutes alone with Bobby, so we get in there, we apologize, and then we get back on the campaign trail."
Ben Wyatt,"Can I get everyone's attention, please? Our goal was to get 2,000 signatures in support of the merger."
Ben Wyatt,"We got almost 4,000 on the first night."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,That is correct.
Ben Wyatt,"Babe babe, stop wagging your finger."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we don't know how long Leslie's going to be gone, so let's just knock some of this stuff off."
Ben Wyatt,We're good.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie has her own busy life and I happen to be an excellent pie maker, so we figured we'd switch it up a bit."
Ben Wyatt,"And actually, right now it's Mr. Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"I love you, Kay Hanley!"
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Mean Ben?
Ben Wyatt,Sounds good.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I'd say that's fifty-fifty boos and cheers.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,Do you think a depressed person could make this?
Ben Wyatt,Do you see him?
Ben Wyatt,"I think at some point, you and I should probably make out with each other."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look at what I've accomplished."
Ben Wyatt,"Are you sure you're cool with JJ's Diner catering what you've referred to as ""The wedding of the millennium""?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, we should take separate cars to the restaurant tonight."
Ben Wyatt,Chris is deadly serious about this
Ben Wyatt,Is that smoke?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie, he does make a compelling argument."
Ben Wyatt,I'm the furthest thing from depressed.
Ben Wyatt,Depressed?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Just don't know why I got my hopes up.
Ben Wyatt,The worst part was my parents grounded me.
Ben Wyatt,So I pretty much ran the place into the ground after two months and got impeached.
Ben Wyatt,They're idiots.
Ben Wyatt,We got to get out of here.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,It's a trap!
Ben Wyatt,The biggest service was getting you to stop singing.
Ben Wyatt,It's a trap.
Ben Wyatt,We have to cut 32% of the--
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, this is really great today, but there's going to be a lot of pain ahead, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"And if you have any further questions hold on to them, because she has a lot of work to do."
Ben Wyatt,Is that what you guys call me?
Ben Wyatt,That concludes councilwoman Knope's press conference.
Ben Wyatt,Ice Town was a debacle.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we didn't want to steal your thunder."
Ben Wyatt,They'll never get over it.
Ben Wyatt,She's really tired.
Ben Wyatt,I am.
Ben Wyatt,"When I was 18, I ran for mayor of my small town."
Ben Wyatt,And won.
Ben Wyatt,"A little bit of anti-establishment voter rebellion, I guess."
Ben Wyatt,"Here's the thing, though, about 18 year olds."
Ben Wyatt,Just a few hours.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"So Leslie, can you do Perd Hapley?"
Ben Wyatt,"By the way, I have a meeting with Marlene GriggsKnope."
Ben Wyatt,Is this your brother?
Ben Wyatt,I don't like seeing you like this.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you have to be able to make decisions like this, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"You have to be harsh, you know? No one's going to elect you to do anything if you don't show that you're a responsible grown-up."
Ben Wyatt,It It's probably not possible.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Please, Mr. Mayor, let me."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Whoomp there it is.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Barney."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't make a pie.
Ben Wyatt,It's ready.
Ben Wyatt,"The question is, are they?"
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,It's actually Ms. Knope.
Ben Wyatt,You have a brother?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you want to run for office someday, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you'd last about 30 seconds with that work."
Ben Wyatt,"When we went to Hawaii, you woke me up at 3:00 A.M. to watch Meet the Press."
Ben Wyatt,I want the kids to have their concert.
Ben Wyatt,Is that any relation?
Ben Wyatt,Do you stand behind everything you've done?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"So what? That's good, because there shouldn't be just one idea anyway."
Ben Wyatt,"So, maybe Leslie doesn't fit your personal idea of what a candidate's wife should be."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,We are getting a lot of media requests about this.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm not a monster."
Ben Wyatt,Then screw 'em.
Ben Wyatt,Whoomp! There it is.
Ben Wyatt,That's what it was.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,But let me ask you this: Do you think this town is better off than it was a year ago?
Ben Wyatt,You shouldn't have been.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it ended up kind of ruining my life."
Ben Wyatt,"And now, I'm balancing budgets so I can show people I'm responsible."
Ben Wyatt,"So I can run for office again someday and not be laughed at, you know."
Ben Wyatt,It's allowed.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you can hate your job sometimes."
Ben Wyatt,Did you hear back from Elise?
Ben Wyatt,Oh good Lord.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so there's a couple more people I want you to meet."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,That was my brother.
Ben Wyatt,There he is.
Ben Wyatt,He just had a baby girl.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,And you seem like you could use a beer.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Andy
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, before you say anything, let me just show you what I got at Doug's Donuts."
Ben Wyatt,It's an Lshaped eclair!
Ben Wyatt,Let's get a beer.
Ben Wyatt,At the 11th hour the Newports are trying to install these voting machines at several precincts around town.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, actually."
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,This is city council candidate Leslie Knope when she was ten years old.
Ben Wyatt,"This is Andy Dwyer, and it is an honor to meet you, sir."
Ben Wyatt,"Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, at one point, for no reason, I just took off my shoes and held them in my hand."
Ben Wyatt,You want to get a beer?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,That's three weeks of work.
Ben Wyatt,He is coming over.
Ben Wyatt,We just have to convince Barney to give her a shot.
Ben Wyatt,I wouldn't call it that.
Ben Wyatt,It was more like a savory pastry.
Ben Wyatt,I think that job is perfect for April.
Ben Wyatt,So your company is involved with one of the bidders?
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, I know your business is failing, but this just isn't worth it."
Ben Wyatt,"I emailed Leslie two days ago and I compared it to Avatar, Chris, and how can it not be longer?"
Ben Wyatt,"Delicate little dough pocket filled with tomato sauce, cheese, and seasoned meat."
Ben Wyatt,Just a stunning culinary innovation.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"A lot of charities waste their money on overhead, but we at the Sweetums Foundation, spend our money wisely."
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"You see, in my head, I thought that was really, really cool."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, I'm not."
Ben Wyatt,"I got ""Blood Spurt."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh Let it out, I guess."
Ben Wyatt,"And we'll leak that it was Leslie's decision and yours seem tough and fair, what with sacrificing her old department"
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, that would make anyone cranky."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,That's all we ask.
Ben Wyatt,I came off like an idiot.
Ben Wyatt,He knows we're American.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, I'm gonna say no."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, he might have hated me."
Ben Wyatt,Why are you wearing a poncho?
Ben Wyatt,This is weird.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you can have this week."
Ben Wyatt,We'll take the next one.
Ben Wyatt,Should we talk about how you claimed your mom was a Filipino woman you'd never met?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,"There was this British kid in my high school who always called me ""Big Ben"" and would punch me really hard on the arm, and go, ""Bong! Bong! Bo"""
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I are meeting with an English charity foundation to expand our afterschool music program, and British people love me."
Ben Wyatt,How much beer were you drinking?
Ben Wyatt,I have a photo op with Gryzzl tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,Between now and then we have a ton of stuff scheduled.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, we are."
Ben Wyatt,So the only thing you did was stop drinking beer?
Ben Wyatt,Looks like we're gonna have to skip the pie baking event and the ceremonial squash toss.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, what are you doing here?"
Ben Wyatt,They do have one thing in common.
Ben Wyatt,She doesn't want the job.
Ben Wyatt,I was completely flustered.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not."
Ben Wyatt,This is city council candidate Bobby Newport today.
Ben Wyatt,And we should not have driven here on a bus with your face on it.
Ben Wyatt,That's the whole thing.
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, I hate to state the obvious, but you chose a life in politics."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the more you actually accomplish, the more heat you're gonna draw."
Ben Wyatt,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, I should have seen this coming."
Ben Wyatt,I'll probably Shouldn't we just go back to Pawnee?
Ben Wyatt,That's only supposed to be--
Ben Wyatt,"And if she disappoints you, you can hold me accountableâ¦. Right?"
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm just going to that-- All right, I'II..."
Ben Wyatt,Hold on.
Ben Wyatt,April? Hey.
Ben Wyatt,We were just talking about you.
Ben Wyatt,We've got some good news.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Knope had better ideas when she was ten than Bobby Newport has now.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, and I think that presentation we put together says it all."
Ben Wyatt,"First problem, she's not as qualified as the other applicants."
Ben Wyatt,I really loved that appetizer.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna go with the first place.
Ben Wyatt,Oatmeal Ann or catfish Ann?
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I are meeting with a tech company called ""Gryzzl."""
Ben Wyatt,"Now, they're giving away free wifi to a few cities across America, and we're going to pitch Pawnee to them."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what are you doing?"
Ben Wyatt,And what exactly does Gryzzl do?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, ""It's the cloud for your cloud."""
Ben Wyatt,No idea.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"So Gryzzl's really taken off, huh?"
Ben Wyatt,Donna.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I know it's tough to hear these things, but just try not to get obsessed over one comment."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I think Pawnee is a great candidate for your free wireless initiative."
Ben Wyatt,We lead the country in online pizza ordering.
Ben Wyatt,"In fact, a lot of people go to the library just to order pizza online."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"Obviously, we're no Akron."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we're more like Dayton."
Ben Wyatt,"But with your help, we can become Toledo."
Ben Wyatt,Which Ann is screaming like a maniac?
Ben Wyatt,Swirl me.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"So this after school music program has been really successful in Pawnee, and we've expanded it to eight other towns in Indiana, but we feel with your help, we can"
Ben Wyatt,"And I know we can get into trouble, but I can't take this anymore, and I feel like we have to at least talk about it."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's not just me, right?"
Ben Wyatt,You really have to let that go.
Ben Wyatt,Are you Are you all right?
Ben Wyatt,"That is good, but only 33% said that they would consider voting for you."
Ben Wyatt,71% said you have a strong command of the issues.
Ben Wyatt,How about that?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here we go."
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you were able to recite that entire movie from memory on the plane ride.
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, camping is awesome."
Ben Wyatt,They give tours.
Ben Wyatt,"As I was saying, we've really made this music program work in Indiana, and we think, with your help, we could turn this into a wide reaching international program."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should let him play with the blue helicopter.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, we are guests of Lord Covington."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry about it.
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, boy, here it comes."
Ben Wyatt,I thought you'd enjoy meeting numbers 4 and 26 on Leslie's list of amazing women.
Ben Wyatt,Your City Council and your Mayor are the threats to your department.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, now that I'm a pushover, why not ask for 10, or 20, or 100 new school buses and a fleet of school yachts?"
Ben Wyatt,How is that better?
Ben Wyatt,I love it.
Ben Wyatt,"Effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice."
Ben Wyatt,That's nonsense.
Ben Wyatt,What if she starts going around telling people I'm a pushover?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I didn't think so."
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not fine."
Ben Wyatt,You guys want to do all the mindless work?
Ben Wyatt,You want to photocopy?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I was pretty sure it was gonna happen one way or the other."
Ben Wyatt,How about you?
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,I'm doing it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I've had better."
Ben Wyatt,They're making a sequel I'm assuming with the same alternate timeline.
Ben Wyatt,"So, while they repaint the lines in the parking lot, we're asking everyone to do street parking."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah she died like 20 minutes after that.
Ben Wyatt,"That's Craig, Donna, and most importantly--"
Ben Wyatt,"But if J.J. Abrams and company expect us to believe that it's Spock with the romantic tension with Uhura and not Kirk Well, let's just say, the message boards are goin' nuts."
Ben Wyatt,I'm leaving.
Ben Wyatt,We're going to need all hands on deck.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so we make her an actual resume, then put on a big presentation, show Barney that she's more than qualified."
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, everyone is."
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Ben Wyatt,Get me Garry Gergich.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, what about you?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, great job, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"We didn't do anything to get you into this situation, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I'm in charge of food for the wedding.
Ben Wyatt,"With all this, Barney will at least have to give her a shot."
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Ben Wyatt,That was as long as it was loud.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, he's disgusting, but I want to take his money and give it to needy people, so I'm just gonna keep on smiling."
Ben Wyatt,"You okay, Ron?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,Nothing you're saying is helpful.
Ben Wyatt,So I brought in Pawnee's three best caterers and a panel of experts.
Ben Wyatt,Ron loves meat.
Ben Wyatt,"And Tom considers himself a foodie, which apparently means taking instagrams of food instead of eating it."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,You can really help your personal brand if you show that you're a mogul that gives as much as he gets.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's not true."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, moving on to recycling."
Ben Wyatt,I know it.
Ben Wyatt,"In exchange, no more puppy killer ads for the rest of the campaign."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so I liked number one, Chris liked number two, and Ron liked number three."
Ben Wyatt,Chris loves vegetables.
Ben Wyatt,How in the world am I supposed to run for office? Our lives are like one big unexpected stuffed zebra emergency.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm wearing his clothes.
Ben Wyatt,"Huh, Barney?"
Ben Wyatt,"Joe, I've determined that the lewd picture was sent by you because you sent it from your personal email address, stinkmaster69@alumni.sarahlawrencecollege.edu."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Sarah Lawrence?
Ben Wyatt,You also bragged about it to many of your coworkers.
Ben Wyatt,I doubt that's a saying.
Ben Wyatt,We are terminating you effective immediately.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, April, and Andy, you'll be throwing a party for our biggest donors."
Ben Wyatt,It's rude to say it.
Ben Wyatt,You have an opinion on pockets.
Ben Wyatt,So the Sweetums Foundation has really accomplished a lot recently.
Ben Wyatt,Our health care outreach program has reduced pink eye in the rural community by 30% to 70%.
Ben Wyatt,"Play an action card, build a bell tower inside your citadel."
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you turned this situation into a political sideshow.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no, no, you're a smart guy, clearly picked up some flashy tricks, but you made one crucial mistake."
Ben Wyatt,You forgot about the essence of the game.
Ben Wyatt,It's about the Cones.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, don't say that."
Ben Wyatt,"Move my abbot to the ocean hex, which moves my Brinksman to the Devil's Lair, and pushes my farmer-- yes, my humble farmer-- directly into the central cone."
Ben Wyatt,What is this?
Ben Wyatt,Great job.
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, you have never been neutral on anything in your life."
Ben Wyatt,Where are the kids?
Ben Wyatt,"No, this is more important."
Ben Wyatt,Now this debate is our best chance to close that gap.
Ben Wyatt,"But now, thanks to the new Gryzzl headquarters, this district will soon transform into a hub of innovation for decades to come."
Ben Wyatt,Let's just go hear what they have to say.
Ben Wyatt,"The ""L"" is for Leslie For your name."
Ben Wyatt,Everyone's waiting downstairs in my office.
Ben Wyatt,What are what?
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, Ann, and Tom, you guys will be talking to reporters, providing facts, general spin."
Ben Wyatt,Keep me posted.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Ben Wyatt,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie?"
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Senators."
Ben Wyatt,Chris?
Ben Wyatt,I'm dying.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we have to run."
Ben Wyatt,We'll see you all at my economic address.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks for coming, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,Because he didn't eat anything.
Ben Wyatt,"He just took pictures and talked about the ""wow"" factor."
Ben Wyatt,They like me here.
Ben Wyatt,I wouldn't say that.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm dealing with an actual problem right now, okay? Which, by the way, is what I do for a living."
Ben Wyatt,And now some firemen are using the lot as a triage center for the emergency drill.
Ben Wyatt,I solve problems.
Ben Wyatt,We don't know where Jerry is.
Ben Wyatt,Donna still can't find any chairs.
Ben Wyatt,"As a budget specialist, and for five years as a City Manager and I'm pretty good at it."
Ben Wyatt,Elise?
Ben Wyatt,"This is just nonsense, it'll blow over."
Ben Wyatt,"I have worked hard to transform this area into a fiscally sound destination for people who want good jobs and a good public education, and I think the results speak for themselves."
Ben Wyatt,Let's get to work.
Ben Wyatt,My name is Ben Wyatt and I'm running for Congress.
Ben Wyatt,And the Pie Mary is ridiculous and antiquated.
Ben Wyatt,I wanted to introduce my friend Leslie Knope Senators Barbara Boxer and Olympia Snow.
Ben Wyatt,Here it goes.
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Ben Wyatt,"Ben Wyatt, from Congressman Murray's campaign."
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Senators?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's what you get when your opponent's the most famous person in town."
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, listen to me, please."
Ben Wyatt,The debate is in nine hours.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm holding zebras.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,The calzones betrayed me?
Ben Wyatt,"It is ""actuarily"" very good to see you guys."
Ben Wyatt,"Never again, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"As God as my witness, they're dead to me."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know if I can beat her.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, it's not."
Ben Wyatt,"Andy... for the record, I did invent this game."
Ben Wyatt,"But it doesn't even matter, because I won and I get another chance to prove that there's something truly special about Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now."
Ben Wyatt,The election is in two weeks.
Ben Wyatt,You can beat Newport.
Ben Wyatt,Should we reschedule or?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, please, everyone."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,We're at a wedding.
Ben Wyatt,Jen's a killer.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, what are you doing?"
Ben Wyatt,None! Just let April do everything.
Ben Wyatt,I'm the Maverick.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, everybody, latest poll is Newport, 40%, Leslie, 32%, with everyone else way back."
Ben Wyatt,It's important to me that you know that.
Ben Wyatt,Do you know that?
Ben Wyatt,Does that compound your interest?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, can we go?"
Ben Wyatt,Hogwarts is fictional.
Ben Wyatt,"No, that's Buckingham Palace."
Ben Wyatt,The Newports have owned this land for 100 years.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,You sure?
Ben Wyatt,Why didn't you lead with that?
Ben Wyatt,London?
Ben Wyatt,She's brilliant and a very fast learner.
Ben Wyatt,"Trust me, Barney."
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold that thought."
Ben Wyatt,What's the point of that?
Ben Wyatt,Whew!
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, don't get me wrong."
Ben Wyatt,"Or possibly, insecticide."
Ben Wyatt,Why now?
Ben Wyatt,Huh?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll lay out the benefits of donating."
Ben Wyatt,Tom will flatter and schmooze as only tom can.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, you know, this is just a learning experience for you, so you just watch and listen."
Ben Wyatt,I kind of like the way they land.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah? Okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, look Good job, again, today."
Ben Wyatt,It was
Ben Wyatt,"For a better Pawnee, vote Knope for city council."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I hang on."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but no calls from reporters, no interview requests."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's get her on the bed."
Ben Wyatt,What do you say?
Ben Wyatt,Neither.
Ben Wyatt,"Try to enjoy this, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Let's go watch the parade.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, you're in London."
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is a bad idea."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie, we're gonna head to the meeting."
Ben Wyatt,"These people are weirdoes, but they're weirdoes who care."
Ben Wyatt,I thought he was gonna be on it.
Ben Wyatt,Really? Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,You know you can't resist a parade.
Ben Wyatt,"You're 4,000 miles away from home."
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, what do you think I should do?"
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,Are you gonna be able to be civil in there?
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I don't know who he's working for, but I guess he's part of one of the bidding groups."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, I know that you're opening up a consulting wing, and I just think that April would be a great hire."
Ben Wyatt,This neighborhood has been mostly abandoned for years.
Ben Wyatt,The guy whose name you forbid me from saying out loud because it fills you with rage.
Ben Wyatt,There can't be an Alchemist of the Hinterlands.
Ben Wyatt,The Hinterlands is a Shadow Kingdom that can only sustain a provost or a denier.
Ben Wyatt,He's here.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, before we go in there, you need to know something."
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, what are you doing?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how about this?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Your boy looks a little lost out there.
Ben Wyatt,"I love you, and I like you."
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Ben Wyatt,Let's play.
Ben Wyatt,You ready?
Ben Wyatt,But that's okay.
Ben Wyatt,Probably not.
Ben Wyatt,"If I win, you give me another shot at free wireless for Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,"Just to remind you, I don't work for the National Park Service."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm trying to get more big companies to donate to the Sweetums Foundation, and tom got us a meeting with Dennis Feinstein, Pawnee's premiere manufacturer of perfumes and cologne."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, ""Spasm."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"No, ""Butter Face""!"
Ben Wyatt,Usually people don't care about anything.
Ben Wyatt,Easily a top five phase.
Ben Wyatt,I've been to a lot of towns.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I gotta say, I think it's kind of impressive."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"I agree, we need something massive and attention getting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we have to convince 'em that Pawnee is a special city."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,One.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, what's up?"
Ben Wyatt,"If we're leaving Pawnee, I'm gonna give 'em a goingaway present free wifi for all."
Ben Wyatt,"Every time someone in Pawnee clicks through a slideshow of American music award red carpet side-boob fails, they'll say, ""Thank you, Ben Wyatt."""
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Ben Wyatt,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,Perfect.
Ben Wyatt,They're playing Cones of Dunshire.
Ben Wyatt,How the hell did they-- Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,How did you guys get your hands on this game?
Ben Wyatt,I invented Cones of Dunshire.
Ben Wyatt,"I am not gonna take ""no"" for an answer."
Bertram Rolands,"I'm Bertram Rolands, a citizen of Eagleton."
Bertram Rolands,Hello.
Bertram Rolands,"With all due respect, Ms. Knope, can't you just clean up your side of the park, put some new equipment there?"
Bertram Rolands,"They're a little-- oh, what's the word? Have-no-money."
Bertram Rolands,"And frankly, I don't like the idea of living in Pawnee."
Bertram Rolands,I live in Eagleton.
Beth,Wow.
Beth,"Yeah, Tammy stinks."
Beth,Nice to meet you.
Beth,Whoa.
Beth,How old is he?
Bill,I'm not changing my mind.
Bill,"Hey, what about you, Mr."
Bill,"And you brought the whole posse with you, huh?"
Bill,It was a hell of a day.
Bill,Price has gone up.
Bill,"No, I'm not."
Bill,And I don't need free publicity.
Bill,"Now for a guy whose only assets are 22 crappy white vans, it's pretty much a dream scenario, so I'm just going to ride this out, see where it takes me."
Bill,That is not what happened.
Bill,"Yeah, it was $900, but now it's $10,000."
Bill,Gah!
Bill,"Hey! What the hell, guys? Move!"
Bill,I'm taking the money.
Bill,I can just pay for it.
Bill,No.
Bill,"With my $10,000."
Bill,"Yeah, but now that I know your bad idea, I can start the company myself."
Bill,"With my $10,000."
Bill,People need to know about it.
Bill,"Look, I own a fleet of 22 crappy white vans, and for some reason there's a massive bidding war going on over them."
Bill,The Newport campaign offered me 10 grand to just rent the vans and park them somewhere.
Bill,"""A man's word is sacred""?"
Bill,Anything else?
Bill,"Okay, what's your stance on pinky swears, George Washington?"
Bill,"So I'm going to tear up your contract, and I'm going to take the money."
Bill,"Now it's $12,000."
Bill,What the hell?
Bill,Yeah.
Bill,"And now it's 15,000."
Bill,Great.
Bill,No?
Bill Haggerty,I discovered that Harrison had a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land you're trying to acquire.
Bill Haggerty,It concerns William Henry Harrison.
Bill Haggerty,"I heard you were looking for information on the Newport land, and I have some very exciting news for you."
Bill Haggerty,Bill Haggerty from the Pawnee Historical Society.
Bill Haggerty,What a shocker.
Bill Haggerty,"Though you do get a yearly stipend of 50,000 Harrison Bucks."
Bill Haggerty,"Sorry, everyone here is a volunteer."
Bill Haggerty,Accepted only at that vending machine.
Bill Haggerty,"Hi, Leslie."
Bill Haggerty,"I've recently self published a biography about Harrison entitled ""Barely a President. William Henry Harrison's Thirty Two Days in the White House."""
Bill Haggerty,One.
Bill Haggerty,Here we are.
Bill Haggerty,No.
Bill Haggerty,"Bill Haggerty, Pawnee Historical Society."
Bill Haggerty,This is all that's left.
Bill Haggerty,Let's head to the Harrison museum over in Vincennes.
Bill Haggerty,Yes.
Bill Haggerty,Her husband is Nick Newport Sr. from Sweetums.
Bill Haggerty,I volunteer there part time.
Bill Haggerty,Everyone in this town is afraid to say no to him.
Bill Haggerty,I'm supposed to be meeting with Ron Swanson.
Bill Haggerty,"I've been trying to meet with him for three months, and now he's not available."
Bill Haggerty,A distant nephew named Zach Harrison.
Bill Haggerty,"It's probably too late now, but, some rich woman, Jessica Wicks, has rented out Turnbill Mansion for a party, and she's making alterations."
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Aw, sweet!"
Bjorn Lerpiss,I'll never consider that.
Bjorn Lerpiss,There was supposed to be a Paunch Burger in this lot next to my house.
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Now, if I wanna start my day off with a tripledecker pancake breakfast pizza, I gotta go to the one that's 10 minutes away, and that makes me 20 minutes late to work every day."
Bjorn Lerpiss,A new Paunch Burger.
Bjorn Lerpiss,Bjorn Lerpiss of the Pawnee Lerpiss family.
Bjorn Lerpiss,I work at home.
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Yeah, but they taste real good."
Bjorn Lerpiss,"And then, you stripped my freedom by putting a park there."
Bobby,Yay!
Bobby Knight Ranger,"Thank you, Pawnee!"
Bobby Knight Ranger,We have been Bobby Knight Ranger!
Bobby Knight Ranger,But you're motoring Yeah motoring Sister Christian.
Bobby Newport,Hurt my feelings.
Bobby Newport,Hi.
Bobby Newport,My dad was this amazing athlete when he was a kid.
Bobby Newport,See?
Bobby Newport,You're supposed to be this positive person.
Bobby Newport,"You know, Leslie's been getting a lot of heat today, but I want you all to know that we talked person-to-person, and she's really great."
Bobby Newport,"In fact, I don't know why they call it a ""campain."""
Bobby Newport,"I guess I want to do a good job because, um, I like it when people think I do a good job."
Bobby Newport,"Ah, that's okay, Joan."
Bobby Newport,And I want your vote because I want Pawnee and my dad to see what I'm made of.
Bobby Newport,The little guy looks like me.
Bobby Newport,"Come on, give me it."
Bobby Newport,Please.
Bobby Newport,"Then I can win the election, and I'll have a big party, and I'll put you both on the guest list, plus one."
Bobby Newport,It would be so cool of you if you just quit.
Bobby Newport,I like this one better.
Bobby Newport,"I'm sorry, please."
Bobby Newport,"I'm just I'm nervous, man."
Bobby Newport,I'm okay.
Bobby Newport,Munchmeat that I think that stinks that happened to him.
Bobby Newport,That that hurt my feelings.
Bobby Newport,People should stop being so mean to her.
Bobby Newport,"Holy [Bleep], Leslie, that was awesome."
Bobby Newport,A lot of people have been asking me how I feel about everything that's happened today.
Bobby Newport,"Here, have a Bobby bar."
Bobby Newport,"Hi, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,"Hey, Jason."
Bobby Newport,"Come on, ugh! Come on, guy."
Bobby Newport,That's okay.
Bobby Newport,"Like, good magic."
Bobby Newport,"So just stop running, okay? Just that stop."
Bobby Newport,Who let you guys in?
Bobby Newport,Look at that thing.
Bobby Newport,"Not, like, cheesy magic."
Bobby Newport,I'm gonna have a man who does magic.
Bobby Newport,The wrecking crew.
Bobby Newport,"Well, let me tell you a little story."
Bobby Newport,What's so funny?
Bobby Newport,Will you come up here?
Bobby Newport,"Go ahead, my dad made 'em."
Bobby Newport,So let's do this.
Bobby Newport,"You know, we're two days into this campaign, and so far it's going great."
Bobby Newport,He's really good.
Bobby Newport,I'm nervous.
Bobby Newport,"Hey, all right."
Bobby Newport,"In fact, if you don't vote for me tomorrow, you should vote for her, because she's super, super awesome lady."
Bobby Newport,Because I want it.
Bobby Newport,I am voting for you.
Bobby Newport,"Come on, come up here."
Bobby Newport,I'm a regular guy.
Bobby Newport,"Now, I'm not saying that is gonna happen, but I do know this."
Bobby Newport,"Ink all over my hands, and the pen thingy came off the chain."
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, you can't vote for yourself, I don't think."
Bobby Newport,I want to run this town like a business.
Bobby Newport,"Hi, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,My dad is friends with John cougar mellencamp.
Bobby Newport,"I'm here with my persian greyhound raclette, who was given to me by my buddy, the pretender to the crown of Alsace-Lorraine."
Bobby Newport,Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
Bobby Newport,"My opponent, Leslie Knope, has a very antibusiness agenda."
Bobby Newport,I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Bobby Newport,That's pretty cool.
Bobby Newport,Can you help me?
Bobby Newport,Want to play bowling?
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, I can't figure this thing out."
Bobby Newport,"I'm pretty sure I'm running unopposed, right?"
Bobby Newport,"Thanks, guy."
Bobby Newport,"The only reason I did this campaign was to impress him, and he couldn't have cared less."
Bobby Newport,And he was kind of a jerk.
Bobby Newport,How do we fix this town?
Bobby Newport,"Because up until now it's been a ""campleasure."""
Bobby Newport,"He was, like, a million years old."
Bobby Newport,"Recently, my dad told me that if Leslie Knope wins the election, they'll probably have to move Sweetums to Mexico."
Bobby Newport,If I win I bet I could get them to stay.
Bobby Newport,"That would be terrible, of course."
Bobby Newport,"When I was in junior high, I started doing track just to impress him Even though I hated it."
Bobby Newport,"Thousands of people in this town would lose their jobs, and we all wouldn't have candy."
Bobby Newport,I don't get it!
Bobby Newport,What is that?
Bobby Newport,"Here, have a Bobby bar."
Bobby Newport,"Oh, hi."
Bobby Newport,And I won.
Bobby Newport,"You know, one time a guy stole some downhill skis out of my jeep."
Bobby Newport,"You guys want anything? This is a restaurant, so they have food and stuff."
Bobby Newport,"No, stop running the campaign."
Bobby Newport,Give me it.
Bobby Newport,Just quit.
Bobby Newport,Give me it.
Bobby Newport,"Come on, give me it."
Bobby Newport,"At the end of the year, I entered the 5,000 meters."
Bobby Newport,"And I was so mad, I punched a mailbox."
Bobby Newport,"I'm against crime, and I'm not ashamed to admit it."
Bobby Newport,"I'm not 100% sure I get the point, but"
Bobby Newport,Just give me the election.
Bobby Newport,"Honestly, I've never been more relieved in my entire life."
Bobby Newport,That's a great story.
Bobby Newport,That's just a great story that happened between me and my dad and nobody else.
Bobby Newport,I like dogs.
Bobby Newport,"Hey, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,Hey.
Bobby Newport,"My dad wrapped me in a big hug, said he was proud of me."
Bobby Newport,Huh?
Bobby Newport,"All right, hey, why don't we line up for autographs and free Bobby bars."
Bobby Newport,My dad made 'em.
Bobby Newport,It was awesome.
Bobby Newport,Gah.
Bobby Newport,Oh.
Bobby Newport,That's right.
Bobby Newport,"Thanks, Leslie."
Bobby Newport,"You know, I guess I would like to tell Mr."
Bobby Newport,"I love it, yeah."
Bobby Newport,Just one thing.
Bobby Newport,I'm sure the Russian guys who built the rocket would be cool with it.
Bobby Newport,"Yeah, hi."
Bobby Newport,You guys are mean.
Bobby Newport,It was it was mean.
Bobby Newport,But you probably knew that already.
Bobby Newport,Seriously.
Bobby Newport,""" And from that day on, my room was gross."
Bobby Newport,You telling me.
Bobby Newport,"And one day she said, ""little Bobby, I'm not going to clean your room no mas."
Bobby Newport,"Ah, okeydoke."
Bobby Newport,"What, mayor?"
Bobby Newport,I'm an American.
Bobby Newport,That's what I'm counting on.
Bobby Newport,What joke?
Bobby Newport,You should check it out.
Bobby Newport,"Yeah, 'cause I'm getting ready to go on a big trip."
Bobby Newport,Really bummed me out.
Bobby Newport,She basically raised me.
Bobby Newport,What do you guys do?
Bobby Newport,So do you want me to sign that to miss lope or just Nesney?
Bobby Newport,"You know what, I had this cleaning lady named Yolanda who was very wise."
Bobby Newport,"Yes, um, why'd you guys post that video of me, man? I mean, that didn't make me feel good."
Bobby Newport,I like dogs.
Bobby Newport,"Hey, Ben, have you ever been to space?"
Bobby Newport,Right?
Bobby Newport,Another awesome point by Leslie.
Bobby Newport,"Man, that would be fun."
Bobby Newport,My father is an American.
Bobby Newport,"Oh, terrific."
Bobby Newport,Can't we just talk about things we like?
Bobby Newport,"Woo! We did it! We did it! Oh, my God, I was so nervous, but we completely go through it."
Bobby Newport,It's been a while.
Bobby Newport,How's Leslie?
Bobby Newport,"I guess my thoughts on abortion are You know, let's just all have a good time."
Bobby Newport,"Is she still, um Uh Oh."
Bobby Newport,I'm Bobby Newport.

Bobby Newport,"Do you have 600,000 dollars?"
Bobby Newport,"What was that thing we ran for, again?"
Bobby Newport,Nice try.
Bobby Newport,"Well, all right."
Bobby Newport,No Timothy Dalton.
Bobby Newport,If you say so.
Bobby Newport,"Hey, party at my dad's lake house."
Bobby Newport,Bring whoever you want.
Bobby Newport,"I tell ya, it's so hard to remember boring stuff like that."
Bobby Newport,"Before I go, I want to bring up a special guest."
Bobby Newport,That's what they need for the deposit.
Bobby Newport,That's why I'm voting for you.
Bobby Newport,My godfather is the viceroy of the principality of Liechtenstein.
Bobby Newport,My mother is an American.
Bobby Newport,That's the guy from Toy Story.
Bobby Newport,How'd you do that?
Bobby Newport,Good to see you guys.
Bobby Newport,"Um, I'm pretty sure I'll figure it out."
Bobby Newport,"I think we should make our parks look like my room after Yolanda finally, you know, gave in and cleaned it up for me."
Bobby Newport,"How 'bout you quit running, then I win, but then I let you do all the work."
Bobby Newport,"What? What does that even mean? Hey, I've got an idea."
Bobby Newport,Leslie?
Bobby Newport,"See, this guy knows what's what."
Bobby Newport,You tell me.
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, we did it!"
Bobby Newport,"By the year 2013, we will have a fully functional mall on Jupiter."
Bobby Newport,Nice to see you.
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, this is fun, isn't it?"
Bobby Newport,"What about you, why are you doing it? Who's your dad?"
Bobby Newport,"If something is dirty, we should clean it up."
Bobby Newport,"People keep asking me: Bobby, what are you gonna do once you get into office?"
Bobby Newport,Who wants a Bobby bar?
Bobby Newport,This seemed easy.
Bobby Newport,"You know what, I need something to do to get my dad off my back."
Bobby Newport,I know this.
Bobby Newport,How's it going?
Bobby Newport,"Everything in life is always just so fun, right?"
Bobby Newport,"- Ah, it's not padded!"
Bobby Newport,"That'll be really fun, too."
Bobby Newport,I have no idea.
Bobby Newport,To space.
Bobby Newport,"Hey, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,"Oh, no, you guys are wrong."
Bobby Newport,Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
Bobby Newport,And isn't my family what this town's really about?
Bobby Newport,Let's start there.
Bobby Newport,Your mom and my dad are both dicks.
Bobby Newport,"God, I don't think I can do it, though."
Bobby Newport,My family owns nine square Miles of land in this town.
Bobby Newport,My friends keep sending me links to that video and they just make fun of me.
Bobby Newport,My dad made 'em.
Bobby Newport,"All right, let me lay it out for you."

Bobby Newport,Do you think you can talk to her and let her do an ad for me?
Bobby Newport,Now I get it.
Bobby Newport,Why are you guys smiling? I feel bad.
Bouncer,"No, you're not."
Bouncer,ID.
Bouncer,ID.
Bouncer,"You're good, bro."
Bouncer,You're not even gonna show me a fake?

Brandi Maxxxx,I had a small part in Argo as well as the porn version Our Goo.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Hello, everyone."
Brandi Maxxxx,"Star of such films as the incredible Burt Wonderbone, A Good Guy to Lay Hard, and Argo."
Brandi Maxxxx,"Oh, we already filmed it."
Brandi Maxxxx,Thank you.
Brandi Maxxxx,"If it weren't for Leslie Knope, there would be far, far less pornography in this town."
Brandi Maxxxx,So I'm thrilled to tell you that I'm playing Leslie Knope in the porn version of the story of this government bailout!
Brandi Maxxxx,Leslie is the best.
Brandi Maxxxx,The porn industry in town was really faltering.
Brandi Maxxxx,"For the record, I'd appear in a film with any of my fellow candidates."
Brandi Maxxxx,"And just like Leslie, I know what it's like to be the only woman in a room full of men."
Brandi Maxxxx,No.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Leslie, you've always been a huge supporter of my work."
Brandi Maxxxx,But now we're back.
Brandi Maxxxx,I'm Brandi Maxxxx
Brandi Maxxxx,"I'd just like to say that, like Leslie, I don't have people do my work for me."
Brandi Maxxxx,Aw! That's so cute.
Brandi Maxxxx,Leslie and I do our work ourselves.
Brandi Maxxxx,I got this one.
Brandi Maxxxx,All my movies are based on books.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Joan, Leslie Knope and I are united--"
Brandi Maxxxx,"I'm glad you're here, Dong Swanson."
Brandi Maxxxx,You look familiar to me.
Brandi Maxxxx,Pleasure to be here.
Brandi Maxxxx,In the painting.
Brandi Maxxxx,What Leslie and I do is obviously art.
Brandi Maxxxx,You're our hero!
Brandi Maxxxx,"Perd, I think this whole debate is ridiculous."
Brandi Maxxxx,That's you.
Brandi Maxxxx,""" Well, I've produced and starred in over 400 adult films this year alone."
Brandi Maxxxx,You're the fat baby.
Brandi Maxxxx,Last year.
Brandi Maxxxx,"My work, of course, is having sex with men and women on camera."
Brandi Maxxxx,Money shot.
Brandi Maxxxx,What Leslie and I want people to know is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want and show it anywhere you want.
Brandi Maxxxx,"It's okay, Leslie."
Brandi Maxxxx,"Whether it's girl-on-girl action, bondage, or what have you."
Brandi Maxxxx,"As President of City Council, I, Councilwoman Brandi Maxxxx, star of more than 11,000 adult films in the last two years, officially declare Garry Gergich Mayor of Pawnee, Indiana, for the fourth time."
Brandi Maxxxx,"You might be thinking, ""what does an adult film star know about politics?"
Brandi Maxxxx,"Hello everyone, I'm Brandi Maxxxx."
Brandi Maxxxx,"For me, it's when the penis goes in."
Brandi Maxxxx,Let's give a big round of applause to Councilwoman Knope for keeping this store in business!
Brandi Maxxxx,"Leslie, if you're watching, I, Brandi Maxxxx, star of 69 Jump Street and Fifty Shaved Old Gays, have your back."
Brandi Maxxxx,In our disgust of this week's events.
Brandi Maxxxx,We have to save it.
Brandi Maxxxx,The local video store's about to go under.

Brett,Okay.
Brett,Right.
Brett,Last week this real scary ghost came down here looking for it.
Brett,Wings of love.
Brett,"How you know my name, homie?"
Brett,"We tried to turn it into a work whistle, like in the beginning of The Flintstones."
Brett,"So how do I kill 'em like, with a gun?"
Brett,Yo.
Brett,"Yo, let's go to Jamaica."
Brett,Go fly away.
Brett,"Yeah, we got, like, a huge vermin problem."

Brett,"Yo, my name is Brett."
Brett,Yeah.
Brett,"This is for the drill, right?"
Brett,There's four ways to skin a cat.
Brett,All right.
Brett,"Let's make it happen, Captain."
Brett,I could fill up a bathtub and just drown 'em one at a time.
Brett,"It had black hair, but you could see through his skin."
Brett,What up?
Brett,"You sure, dude?"
Brett,Regular blade
Brian,I like the one on the left.
Brian,"Hey, I'm Brian."
Brian,I didn't even know that one existed.
Buddy Wood,"Yeah, I got your 50 messages."
Buddy Wood,"Hey, you're blocking my driveway."
Buddy Wood,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Buddy Wood,You're being serious.
Buddy Wood,"But getting back to your affair with Ben Wyatt, who's now your campaign manager"
Buddy Wood,Leslie Knope? - What are you doing?
Buddy Wood,Buddy Wood.
Buddy Wood,"We're setting up over there, found a small piece of carpet without a horrifying smellscape."
Buddy Wood,Oh.
Buddy Wood,I don't.
Buddy Wood,Good luck with that.
Buddy Wood,Leslie Knope.
Buddy Wood,What?
Buddy Wood,Glad you could make it.
Buddy Wood,Are you kidding?
Buddy Wood,"Pawnee's airport is symbolic of the town out of touch, out of date, perhaps, lost, insignificant, and sad."
Buddy Wood,Are you familiar with the term?
Buddy Wood,This sleepy mini Metropolis is the site of a fascinating city council race.
Buddy Wood,"I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, are you inebriated?"
Buddy Wood,I say it's sad.
Buddy Wood,"Okay, this airport seems to me like a metaphor."
Buddy Wood,This is as great for me as it is terrible for you.
Buddy Wood,Moving on
Buddy Wood,Tiramisu is an Italian dessert often
Buddy Wood,"A fitting end to a bizarre interview and a sad moment in a depressing city with no hope, in the waning moments of the bitter saga that has been a contentious campaign."
Buddy Wood,Okay.
Buddy Wood,"Sorry, but Tomorrow morning this gets broadcast around the entire Indianasphere."
Buddy Wood,"Leslie, we're here at the Pawnee municipal airport, which I must add is rather decrepit."
Buddy Wood,"Leslie, welcome to Good Morning."
Buddy Wood,"Joining us today is one of the candidates, Leslie Knope."
Buddy Wood,I'd like to talk about you and Ben Wyatt.
Buddy Wood,"This is a Buddy Wood first an exclusive interview with potential city councilwoman Leslie Knope, who appears to be drunk right now on camera."
Buddy Wood,"Your campaign hit a snag of sorts, with the revelation that you and your boss, Ben Wyatt, were having une affaire de coeur affair of the heart."
Buddy Wood,If you say so.
Buddy Wood,"As much as I enjoy the groveling, I can't destroy the tape because I don't have it, because your sad, tiny backwater airport lost my bags."
Buddy Wood,"Is it this sad, pathetic town that makes you drink this way?"
Buddy Wood,"Okay, Ms. Knope."
Buddy Wood,"You'd think a commuter airport could handle the luggage of 11 people at once, but apparently not."
Buddy Wood,The sheep that watch my show are gonna eat this up like tiramisu.
Buddy Wood,Completely ruined a great story.
Buddy Wood,Your thoughts?
Buddy Wood,Thank God for that mitten factory tragedy.
Buddy Wood,"Pawnee, Indiana, home to the Sweetums Candy Corporation, 19 toxic waste repositories, and not much else."
Burly,So I guess you could say Dave Matthews was doing what we were doing.
Burly,We are Rat Mouse.
Burly,We were basically playing covers of Dave Matthews songs.
Burly,No one was doing what we were doing.
Burly,Did you book us a gig at a kids' party?
Burly,"It's just, you didn't show up for practice, and we like to play."
Burly,Why don't you melt the cheese?
Burly,"That's a pretty good name, actually."
Burly,"Well, that's not really true."
Burly,Everything that used to
Burly,"Well, we never wanted to kick you out."
Burly,You said we were playing at a festival.
Burly,"Whoa, wait six year olds?"
Burly,"Also, The Bag of Smells was a fun experiment, but it has to stop."
Burly,No.
Burly,"Look, if you're not gonna pay rent, at least clean up your dishes."
Burly,"Spread your wings and fly, yeah"
Burly,"Thank you, everyone."
Burly,You mean imperfectly?
Burly,"You know, that's not really how I pictured us breaking up, you know."
Burly,"Hey, man, you were really great out there."
Burly,So we have to play it perfectly every time?
Burly,"Hey, listen, man, I'm really sorry things ended so weird with mouse rat."
Burly,What's going on?
Burly,"Okay, that was the national anthem of Canada."
Burly,He's a really big fan.
Burly,"Remember my nephew, Jack?"
Burly,"If you wanna come back in, you can."
Burly,"Pretty good, man."

Burly,"Welcome back, buddy."
Burly,All right.
Burly,"Hey, man, what's up?"
Burly,Hey.
Burly,Yeah.

Burly,"You win again, Macklin!"
Burly,"Andy, dude, I love you, but shape up or move out."
Burly,I'll admit to everything!
Burly,I hate puppies!
Burly,No!
Burly,No one's had the guts to tell you.
Burly,"First of all, your nachos are terrible."
Burly,What?
Burly,We're not the Wiggles.
Burly,"And now, I'm going to see how long I can hold a D chord."
Burly,Mouse Rat is a rock band.
Burly,Take it easy.
Caller,"Yeah, how can you justify raising taxes for something that will hurt the town?"
Caller,I'll take my answer off the air.
Caller,And I think you should resign.
Caller,"Yeah, I think that lady should resign."
Caller,You should resign and repay your salary.
Caller,"Yeah, if you let penguins get married, where does it end? I mean, would you let me marry my guinea pig?"
Caller,Because I really do want to marry my guinea pig.
Caller,"I just want to say that I love the zoo, and the zoo is really fun."
Carl,"It's terrible, isn't it?"
Carl,First Salvatore and now Mayor Gunderson.
Carl,Salvatore passed away yesterday.
Carl,Ron.
Carl,"Oh, Ron, you didn't hear?"
Carl Lorthner,You know what?
Carl Lorthner,And the third one was recently stolen.
Carl Lorthner,Boom!
Carl Lorthner,"Well, you might not be so confident once you've walked a mile in my size sevens."
Carl Lorthner,I feel hot.
Carl Lorthner,"I call it ""worm log."""
Carl Lorthner,"We used to have three carts, actually."
Carl Lorthner,This is the second one.
Carl Lorthner,How you guys doing?
Carl Lorthner,The raccoon piss one.
Carl Lorthner,"I was wearing this tshirt that said ""Kiss me, I'm Irish."""
Carl Lorthner,I'm going to show you guys all the problems we've been facing.
Carl Lorthner,All right.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, you think you know how to do my job?"
Carl Lorthner,So.
Carl Lorthner,Leslie Knope!
Carl Lorthner,I'm going to show you that we've been doing everything we can.
Carl Lorthner,"And ladies, too."
Carl Lorthner,So we're going to just head out.
Carl Lorthner,"And after that, I'm going to show you this log I found."
Carl Lorthner,You're too important for me until one of your own gets attacked.
Carl Lorthner,"But if there's any criminals out there watching, I never get tired."
Carl Lorthner,"It's got, like, fifty worms on it."
Carl Lorthner,The first one got pushed into the creek by some kids.
Carl Lorthner,I think we've got too much weight.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, no."
Carl Lorthner,But no one would kiss me.
Carl Lorthner,There was urine everywhere.
Carl Lorthner,I didn't mean to yell.
Carl Lorthner,"All right, I'm going to make a hard left here."
Carl Lorthner,A citizen handed in a very interesting home video that I think the people of Pawnee will find very interesting.
Carl Lorthner,Haverford.
Carl Lorthner,"Good to see you, man."
Carl Lorthner,Okay.
Carl Lorthner,Take a peek at this.
Carl Lorthner,Keep your eyes on the creek.
Carl Lorthner,There he is.
Carl Lorthner,This is my favorite part.
Carl Lorthner,"I wanted to read the book first, but then I realized there's no book version of Avatar."
Carl Lorthner,"With budget cuts, we can't afford a single safety light."
Carl Lorthner,Not willing to share with a dog.
Carl Lorthner,"So, I want to tell you a little bit about the park."
Carl Lorthner,"So, it would appear that Park Security was not to blame after all."
Carl Lorthner,I never saw Avatar.
Carl Lorthner,Up here on the left is one of our most beautiful grass fields.
Carl Lorthner,I'll have sex with you in exchange for the tape.
Carl Lorthner,There's been 10 assaults already this year.
Carl Lorthner,It's primarily grass.
Carl Lorthner,Is it hot in here?
Carl Lorthner,"Yes, that's correct."
Carl Lorthner,I came on today because I have some very important information to share.
Carl Lorthner,I finally saw Avatar and I thought it lived up to the hype.
Carl Lorthner,"Stick with us, Tom."
Carl Lorthner,Are you guys hot?
Carl Lorthner,What?
Carl Lorthner,I'm good.
Carl Lorthner,Disagreement.
Carl Lorthner,"Yeah, I've always been a bit of an outdoorsman."
Carl Lorthner,Fine.
Carl Lorthner,"What's up, pencil pushers?"
Carl Lorthner,Take a look at this path.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, Leslie."
Carl Lorthner,"When I was a kid, my parents used to make me hang out in the backyard a lot and just run around until I got tired."
Carl Lorthner,You guys ready?
Carl Lorthner,You guys got any snacks?
Carl Lorthner,Any of this looking familiar?
Carl Lorthner,I'm sorry.
Carl Lorthner,Here we go.
Carl Lorthner,What did you guys do for St. Patty's Day?
Carl Lorthner,Okay.
Carl Lorthner,"Well, since you decided to drag my name through the mud on TV, I figured why not return the favor."
Carl Lorthner,Going fast.
Carl Lorthner,Who do you think they're assaulting?
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, yeah."
Carl Lorthner,"The second one, raccoons got onto."
Carl Lorthner,I'm not surprised.
Carl Lorthner,"Hey, Leslie."
Carl Lorthner,Have you seen Avatar?
Carl Lorthner,We have!
Casey,I disagree.
Casey,I think there's a benefit to educating the genders separately.
Chance Frenlm,Topless park.
Chance Frenlm,I think we ought to throw those bars out and eat ham and mayonnaise sandwiches.
Chance Frenlm,There is no strategy to chutes and ladders.
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this!
Chance Frenlm,Her daughter is an idiot!
Chance Frenlm,Ham and mayonnaise!
Chance Frenlm,"My cat, Turnip, was the greatest cat ever, and I'd like to put his ashes in the time capsule."
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Chance Frenlm,Eagleton is terrible! Why should I bail them out with the hard-earned money from my unemployment check?
Chance Frenlm,Her daughter is an idiot!
Chance Frenlm,"Well, your daughter is an idiot."
Chance Frenlm,It's just luck.
Chance Frenlm,"I think the slogan should be ""Pawnee, home of crackers, the orangest goldfish in Indiana."""
Chance Frenlm,"Oh, come on!"
Chance Frenlm,Ham and mayonnaise!
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Chance Frenlm,Except for Turnip! Except for Turnip!
Chance Frenlm,Her daughter is an idiot!
Chance Frenlm,It's natural.
Chance Frenlm,Syrup comes from a bush.
Chance Frenlm,Forget whatever that Pawnee Commons is.
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this!
Chance Frenlm,"Yeah, yeah."
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this.
Chance Frenlm,Corn's a fruit.
Chance Frenlm,"I like their phones, but they've gone too far, sending this stuff to our houses."
Chance Frenlm,Gryzzl has no right to search our private data.
Chance Frenlm,What's so bad about corn syrup?
Chance Frenlm,I'm with that pervert.
Chang,"We tried to tell you about the show, man."
Chang,"I called your cell, like, 20 times."

Charles Woliner,I made Jessica.
Charles Woliner,I'm Charles Woliner.
Charles Woliner,I've judged every Miss Pawnee Pageant for the last 30 years.
Chef,"He's being modest, it is thanks to him my family remains in this country."
Chef,And it was all pro bono.
Chef,Would you like to try the camel stomach?
Chelsea,Penne and the Jets.
Chief Fugleberg,We could use his brains on the force.
Chief Fugleberg,Hey.
Chief Fugleberg,It's weird.
Chief Fugleberg,"He got 100% on his written test, first guy in history to do it, but he failed his personality examination."
Chief Fugleberg,"Oh, has Chris Traeger not told you?"
Chief Fugleberg,He's certainly something of a genius.
Chief Fugleberg,"That's your buddy Andy Dwyer over there, isn't it? Such a shame."
Chief Fugleberg,"He's a sweet kid, just doesn't have what it takes to be a cop."
Chief Fugleberg,Too bad.
Chief Fugleberg,Sorry.
Chief Fugleberg,Won't they become infected?
Chief Konner,"Just some stuff we liked, you know? Anyway, we had a lot of fun putting it together."
Chief Konner,And this is an attractive lady with a hamburger for a head.
Chief Konner,Thanks.
Chief Konner,"Well, we aren't really artists."
Chief Konner,But we gave it a shot.
Chief Konner,Ms. Knope.
Chief Konner,This is my nephew over here.
Chief Konner,"It's your basic dogs playing poker, but with an everything's on fire theme."
Chief Konner,We think it's a winner.
Chief Trumple,I just said it was good pizza.
Chief Trumple,What the hell is wrong with this guy?
Chief Trumple,Pizza's good.
Chief Trumple,Nothing but trouble there.
Chief Trumple,"In fact, I don't want him within 500 feet of the library."
Chief Trumple,But keep him away from that crazy librarian.
Chief Trumple,All right.
Chief Trumple,"For God's sake Knope, get a grip."
Chief Trumple,"I think my Eagleton colleagues would agree that we don't want to make a federal case out of this, so I suggest you both apologize to each never and we can pretend this never happened."
Chief Trumple,"Hi, Hey, Knope."
Chief Trumple,"Ladies, if you don't apologize, we're going to have to toss the both of you in jail, so just swallow your pride say you're sorry."
Chief Trumple,We had no choice.
Chief Trumple,They started having sex at the court house.
Chief Trumple,Wyatt.
Chief Trumple,Good pizza.
Chief Trumple,It's good.
Chief Trumple,Thanks for the party.
Chief Trumple,"And frankly, they've donated a lot of money to the department."
Chief Trumple,"Yeah, how's it going?"
Chief Trumple,Leslie Knope gets as many favors as she needs.
Chief Trumple,Because she's the kind of a person who uses favors to help other people.

Choir,I prayed for someone like you
Choir,All my life--
Chris,I know.
Chris,I get it.
Chris,Clever lady.
Chris,"God, I gotta borrow some of your ice!"
Chris,"Well, not for this."
Chris,It looked so much easier on the Internet.
Chris,Someone steps into the room.
Chris,"Oh, God!"
Chris,Okay.
Chris,I will now extinguish this candle with my bare hand.
Chris,"Imagine a mother of three, maybe she's a teacher."
Chris,Great question.
Chris,99% real.
Chris,"Hey, watch this."
Chris,It's gonna be a little crammed in there.
Chris,"Don't worry, I'll be right on the other side of that glass."
Chris,That really hurt!
Chris,"Oh, you're not on your period, are you?"
Chris,"Oh, no, thanks, I'm not thirsty."
Chris,"Sometimes smiling is read as ""AIDS."""
Chris,You can look inside anything.
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,"Get your MRI and get out, huh?"
Chris,"So, did you want to go back to your place?"
Chris,I'd have to do an MRI.
Chris,"Yeah, but what's inside that bread? Could be cheese."
Chris,"In less than an hour, I know what it is."
Chris,She's scared.
Chris,What?
Chris,"Well, I'm offering you a free scan."
Chris,"It usually costs up to 2,000 dollars."
Chris,"She knows something's wrong, but she doesn't know what it is."
Chris,Imagine being able to look inside his head.
Chris,I'm kind of spoiling you here.
Chris,Good.
Chris,"Frankly, I don't want to invest in someone who only has three months to live."
Chris,See that guy over there?
Chris,Try not to smile too much. It'll affect the diagnosis.
Chris,"You could look inside this steak or you could look inside this butter or these potatoes, or this candle, or this beer, or this flower, or this bread."
Chris,"But the best part about being an MRI technician is, I can see inside everything."
Chris,Strike two.
Chris,"All right, Leslie. You're going to start hearing some loud noises and see some flashing lights."
Chris,"Well, I went to Wisconsin for both undergrad and grad school."
Chris,Can you imagine if you had to spend the rest of your life sipping a steak through a straw?
Chris,"Yeah, we should go."
Chris,No cell phones!
Chris,Don't touch that.
Chris,Just take your hands off it.
Chris,I actually heard that.
Chris,We almost wheeled you out of here on a chair.
Chris,Sure.
Chris,"Oh, here, let me take your coat."
Chris,"It's, like, a smudge or something."
Chris,Well it actually all looks pretty good.
Chris,Go Badgers!
Chris,You've got a large brain.
Chris,"Well, it looks pretty... Hang on."
Chris,That's weird.
Chris,Your brain.
Chris,See that shadow right there?
Chris,"Oh, my God!"
Chris,You look beautiful.
Chris,"Oh, don't worry about it."
Chris,Yeah.
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,I'd have a doctor look at that immediately if I were you.
Chris,Oh.
Chris,"Oh, wait."
Chris,Yeah.
Chris,Way to go Chris. Did I just make it awkward?
Chris,That almost happened to you. You were a smudge away.
Chris,Looks like we make a pretty good team.
Chris,So you never told me where you're from.
Chris,"Keep still, please."
Chris,"And you said that your mom works in government, too, is that right?"
Chris,"You gotta keep still. No talking, Leslie."
Chris,What kind of music do you like?
Chris,Sure.
Chris,Keep still.
Chris,"Very important that you keep still at this moment, Leslie."
Chris,I've told you that a thousand times.
Chris,Did you ever break your arm?
Chris,You can answer that.
Chris,"Here, I'll turn it off."
Chris,Thank God I was here.
Chris,Why would you say that?
Chris,"You never had any kids, right, Leslie?"
Chris,You've got a great oven.
Chris,You got ample room in there.
Chris,"Honestly, if you wanted to, you could go triplets right off the bat, Leslie."
Chris,"You got a big, industrial-sized oven."
Chris,"God, that's exciting!"
Chris,"So, you're in charge of amusement parks, right?"
Chris,"I wish she'd told me that you went to Indiana, but whatever."
Chris,"Ann kept going on about how wonderful you are, and I just had to see for myself."
Chris,Badgers.
Chris,I guess I'm not as good a tech as I thought I was.
Chris,No.
Chris,I can't believe I turned the machine off for that.
Chris,I should have noticed that you're missing a heart.
Chris,Hey!
Chris,"Goodbye, Leslie."
Chris,"Hey, do you mind if we pick up my son Nate at his basketball game on the way back?"
Chris,"You ever see that movie, The Matrix?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,Have you bought ingredients?
Chris Traeger,"I think if you continue crosstraining the way you have, you're gonna I don't see any ingredients."
Chris Traeger,That's not true.
Chris Traeger,It's a government joke.
Chris Traeger,We may have to call the fire department.
Chris Traeger,You're right.
Chris Traeger,Excellent.
Chris Traeger,Skittle sandwich?
Chris Traeger,I've started meeting with people to fill in for Leslie.
Chris Traeger,I'll be fine.
Chris Traeger,You should hydrate.
Chris Traeger,I have found five candidates I'd like to hire and two I'd like to be lifelong friends with.
Chris Traeger,Can I talk to you?
Chris Traeger,And I am here to mediate.
Chris Traeger,I'm not fine.
Chris Traeger,It didn't work.
Chris Traeger,You've overcome so much.
Chris Traeger,"I'm not sure if you're aware, but I am romantically involved with Jerry Gergich's surprisingly hot daughter Millicent Gergich."
Chris Traeger,Fun fact about me.
Chris Traeger,Do you need help shopping?
Chris Traeger,I love setting people up.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,Are you hurt?
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,I may never smile again.
Chris Traeger,"I did have to go to a very seedy location to find it, but now I know where to go to place a bet on horse fighting."
Chris Traeger,MonaLisa's taking advantage of you.
Chris Traeger,And I love telling them that I love them.
Chris Traeger,Mostly because I love most people.
Chris Traeger,I love telling people how I feel.
Chris Traeger,What's your favorite food?
Chris Traeger,Millicent Gergich has literally torn my heart from my body and replaced it with a thick slab of sadness.
Chris Traeger,Good job.
Chris Traeger,"And also two waters, please, but no hurry."
Chris Traeger,And I am so happy for you.
Chris Traeger,I like that.
Chris Traeger,Here's my secret.
Chris Traeger,Can you move?
Chris Traeger,We're on.
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Chris Traeger,You are the most wonderful dog in the whole world.
Chris Traeger,And I'm sure that it's not easy when it's the sister of a dear friend.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna go fire up the grill.
Chris Traeger,"I determine someone's best qualities, and then, I find someone else with compatible qualities, and I bring them together."
Chris Traeger,Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,"See, I just don't believe in this whole don't let people know how you feel nonsense."
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,I don't know why.
Chris Traeger,You have just found your buddy boxes.
Chris Traeger,Son.
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Chris Traeger,"Me, too."
Chris Traeger,Yes! Yes! I thought you didn't have a preference!
Chris Traeger,You?
Chris Traeger,Ooh!
Chris Traeger,Stand up for yourself.
Chris Traeger,Because it will literally be the greatest child who has ever lived.
Chris Traeger,Way to go.
Chris Traeger,"I'm just a little behind because every time I start, I get a little emotional."
Chris Traeger,Thank you all so much for helping me with these boxes.
Chris Traeger,"Way to go, buddy."
Chris Traeger,And you did use your tongue.
Chris Traeger,"And, Jerry, I've decided to take your daughter home."
Chris Traeger,And we may be having intercourse.
Chris Traeger,"Boy or girl, it doesn't matter."
Chris Traeger,And then several more times.
Chris Traeger,I will.
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Each box contains a memento of our friendship.
Chris Traeger,And then a couple more times.
Chris Traeger,"You are such a brave, good dog, with so much spirit."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, big boy."
Chris Traeger,Come here.
Chris Traeger,Champion!
Chris Traeger,That was the year you went from being an auditor to a legend.
Chris Traeger,Andy and April.
Chris Traeger,I believe I am that human being.
Chris Traeger,Sparks are flying!
Chris Traeger,"Speak directly to her and tell her, ""I will not be disrespected."""
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,You're Tom Haverford.
Chris Traeger,Wait a minute.
Chris Traeger,I had an amazing time at that party.
Chris Traeger,You were a worthy adversary.
Chris Traeger,"It's from our turkey versus beef cookoff, remember?"
Chris Traeger,"And in the case of the woman who's stolen my heart, the culprit was Millicent Gergich."
Chris Traeger,Fun pun alert.
Chris Traeger,Excuse me.
Chris Traeger,"I was gonna give them to you later, but there is no time like the present."
Chris Traeger,And then one more time.
Chris Traeger,"You're a smart, successful young man with an adorable, little belly."
Chris Traeger,Fresh lettuce is my all-time favorite food.
Chris Traeger,"Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,Wow!
Chris Traeger,"""That sucks""?"
Chris Traeger,"I like the idea of double the signings, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,"""Don't think about how much this itches."""
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,"I am launching a fullscale investigation into my romantic relationship with your daughter Millicent Gergich, and I thought I could pick your brain."
Chris Traeger,Johnny.
Chris Traeger,"No, Andy."
Chris Traeger,That's very good advice.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my Is she Is she sick?"
Chris Traeger,A 311 line.
Chris Traeger,Casual?
Chris Traeger,And we should start thinking about wardrobe.
Chris Traeger,I would like you to write me a script and get it to me in an hour.
Chris Traeger,I took your advice.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I'm not crazy.
Chris Traeger,Is there a script yet?
Chris Traeger,And I will do it.
Chris Traeger,I'll go get changed.
Chris Traeger,Jerry!
Chris Traeger,Citizens will call 311 for whatever problem they have.
Chris Traeger,I want to do the same thing for the city.
Chris Traeger,"And now, no matter what emotion I'm feeling, I call one number my therapist."
Chris Traeger,"I think I've been pretty fair with you, and I'm beginning to feel angry."
Chris Traeger,What's whine & cheese club?
Chris Traeger,And what is Ann complaining about?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have the painting, and you need to bring it back in."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie Knope, you need to bring that painting back."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, how great."
Chris Traeger,She's upset that I'm trying to help her?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, no one needs to be jammed today."
Chris Traeger,"That's too much, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,Are you sick?
Chris Traeger,I may have mentioned that to you already.
Chris Traeger,I said one thing.
Chris Traeger,Why are you yelling?
Chris Traeger,And also girls' names are so cute.
Chris Traeger,I recently began intensive psychotherapy.
Chris Traeger,What do I get if I win?
Chris Traeger,"It used to be, when I was down, I called my mother."
Chris Traeger,Annie.
Chris Traeger,Formal?
Chris Traeger,"When I lacked selfconfidence, I called my running coach."
Chris Traeger,Bill.
Chris Traeger,Several times.
Chris Traeger,I have been a fan of April since day one.
Chris Traeger,Carob cookies and berries are literally my favorite dessert alternative.
Chris Traeger,I will.
Chris Traeger,"I don't think it's appropriate for people to be getting ""wet with sound."""
Chris Traeger,I'm going to go talk to my therapist.
Chris Traeger,I'm not going to lie to you.
Chris Traeger,I needed that.
Chris Traeger,Good idea?
Chris Traeger,I know.
Chris Traeger,Dragon fruit.
Chris Traeger,And I kind of like to see her again before she leaves.
Chris Traeger,I sound insane.
Chris Traeger,"Now, I know it's a one night stand and that she's leaving town, but our ferocious sexual decathlon did radically improve my mood."
Chris Traeger,"Now, you've rushed her into this, and now, Jamm's sharpening the knives."
Chris Traeger,Not good.
Chris Traeger,My feet are very clean.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, this is a publicly funded couples dance."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I don't need to do that."
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I have something I need to talk to you about."
Chris Traeger,She is not ready.
Chris Traeger,"A kiwano, or horned melon."
Chris Traeger,A peach.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, it was just last night."
Chris Traeger,"Uncollected garbage, broken streetlight, and we will direct them to the proper department."
Chris Traeger,"You're welcome, Chris."
Chris Traeger,"Daisy, Annabelle, Lilly"
Chris Traeger,"We should get to the goodbye party, although I know it's mostly for Ann."
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,"Either way, this is great."
Chris Traeger,I am flattered.
Chris Traeger,We have been on the prowl for some amazing pots.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,"That is sad, but also, in this town, understandable."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Did you pause it?
Chris Traeger,Sarcasm again!
Chris Traeger,Who is that guy?
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Andy."
Chris Traeger,I agree.
Chris Traeger,I love this idea.
Chris Traeger,Can we talk later?
Chris Traeger,Bad idea?
Chris Traeger,"I certainly have no other plans for Valentine's Day, because I am completely alone."
Chris Traeger,And I love me for thinking of it.
Chris Traeger,My therapist said that I need to be more vocal about appreciating myself.
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,You're a delight.
Chris Traeger,I'm calling Dr. Saperstein.
Chris Traeger,"Harris, we know who you are."
Chris Traeger,Everything ends!
Chris Traeger,"As your city manager, I recommend that you formally apologize and that, in the future, you stick to the letter of the law, but between you and me, as your best friend"
Chris Traeger,Can I ask your advice on something?
Chris Traeger,Is your mom visiting?
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Chris Traeger,"I have convened a meeting of the Public Arts Commission, and we will abide by their decision."
Chris Traeger,"The root of sarcasm is truth, Ann."
Chris Traeger,I kind of admire what you did up there.
Chris Traeger,You're going to love her.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Made me happy that I voted for you as my city council member.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, how did it go with MonaLisa?"
Chris Traeger,"Now, my partner Ben wants to say something."
Chris Traeger,"You are what makes Pawnee great, and I just want to tell you that I am totally supportive of your inspiring efforts here today!"
Chris Traeger,You are all super amazing.
Chris Traeger,Everyone.
Chris Traeger,"Mayor, I promise you that we will find the owner of that weiner and we will punish him."
Chris Traeger,You've left me no choice.
Chris Traeger,"Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig."
Chris Traeger,I am going to launch a fullscale investigation.
Chris Traeger,That's terrible news!
Chris Traeger,"No, she's home up in Wisconsin."
Chris Traeger,My personal low.
Chris Traeger,Ended with a five and a half minute mile.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,You can do it.
Chris Traeger,I hope you were speaking to her in a calming voice 'cause babies can hear everything.
Chris Traeger,And outer beauty is also very important.
Chris Traeger,"My name is Chris Traeger, and I am a big fan of art."
Chris Traeger,I would just like to introduce myself.
Chris Traeger,With my baby.
Chris Traeger,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
Chris Traeger,Inner beauty is very important.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, you zinged me. I love that."
Chris Traeger,Inside and out.
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, everyone."
Chris Traeger,Ben says no.
Chris Traeger,"Actually, Leslie, you're my boss now."
Chris Traeger,"She is interesting, smart and beautiful."
Chris Traeger,"Surely, there has to be a solution, Ben."
Chris Traeger,Goodbye.
Chris Traeger,I'm very confident and I make a lot of eye contact.
Chris Traeger,Everybody!
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Was that Ann?
Chris Traeger,And I sincerely thank you for that suggestion.
Chris Traeger,"That's good to hear, because recently, you've been a little unpredictable."
Chris Traeger,I would be thrilled if we had a boy.
Chris Traeger,It's like a perfect storm of emotions.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, if you could be reincarnated, what would you like to be?"
Chris Traeger,Or a socket wrench.
Chris Traeger,So the problem with reincarnation is that you could be reborn as a pretzel.
Chris Traeger,Buddhists feel that human beings are unlikely to be reincarnated as human beings.
Chris Traeger,"That's what it looks like, ""Distributions."""
Chris Traeger,Everybody!
Chris Traeger,How was your day?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey."
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,"And so I'm hiding out here, so I don't ruin this party for my two amazing best friends who I love so much."
Chris Traeger,"We are having an ""eleven jewel toilet."""
Chris Traeger,I have literally never been more stressed out.
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,"Tom, now is not the time for criticism."
Chris Traeger,There's no more tissue.
Chris Traeger,He's out for the rest of the day.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it looks great."
Chris Traeger,Everything goes away.
Chris Traeger,How did he do?
Chris Traeger,Flu prevention.
Chris Traeger,Don't worry.
Chris Traeger,I am so happy And so sad.
Chris Traeger,"The toast that you gave to Ben and Leslie was so beautiful, and I'm feeling very raw from my therapy."
Chris Traeger,Have some fun in this life.
Chris Traeger,I urge you not to take that role.
Chris Traeger,"I see you with your painting, and I am startled and disappointed."
Chris Traeger,Nope.
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Chris Traeger,I'm hanging upside down with my gravity boots watching Perd.
Chris Traeger,I think the pavement in this town is soft.
Chris Traeger,"I have perfected the art of shaving the human face, and I would love to be able to pass that on."
Chris Traeger,"A weird image, but one that does not diminish my enthusiasm."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Let's go to that party that Tom's having.
Chris Traeger,"Well, Ann Perkins, are you ready to find out the sex of our baby?"
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,Ann.
Chris Traeger,Imagine my horror.
Chris Traeger,"We are having a ""Distributions."""
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry that I was trying to fix all your problems.
Chris Traeger,That really sucks.
Chris Traeger,That sucks.
Chris Traeger,"My body is finely tuned, like a microchip, and the flu is like a grain of sand."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins that was beautiful.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I'm proud of you."
Chris Traeger,"Recently in a moment of weakness, I had sex with Bobby Newport's campaign manager Jennifer Barkley."
Chris Traeger,"Not because of what you did, which was terrible, but because of what I'm going to be able to get you to do."
Chris Traeger,I can't find my car keys.
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, we've been on four dates, but now Millicent Gergich hasn't returned my last two phone calls."
Chris Traeger,Nope.
Chris Traeger,I can't.
Chris Traeger,And I think all of our heads can be a little dinky at times.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, but as city manager, I can't play sides."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, sorry."
Chris Traeger,Great meeting!
Chris Traeger,Good to see you.
Chris Traeger,That's correct.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I guess I'm leaving."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, what's up guys?"
Chris Traeger,"When you are able to focus your mind and your body, anything is possible."
Chris Traeger,What's next?
Chris Traeger,Amber.
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson, you cannot use this crib."
Chris Traeger,"I think the relationship may be in trouble, and I don't know why."
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,You're ignoring every known crib safety standard.
Chris Traeger,You really know your testes.
Chris Traeger,It's all covered in the parenting book I'm reading.
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,How is that possible?
Chris Traeger,Excellent.
Chris Traeger,I literally just fired you.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Nothin'.
Chris Traeger,Because I thought we had a great time the night you got drunk and kissed me.
Chris Traeger,"Me, too."
Chris Traeger,What are you hoping for?
Chris Traeger,"Well, this is it. The final moment."
Chris Traeger,I've had a very tough year.
Chris Traeger,But we are going to get through this.
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, everybody."
Chris Traeger,"Maybe I can mediate, like Dr. Phil, only qualified."
Chris Traeger,I think you'll agree that this department could use a little leadership.
Chris Traeger,"Out of the way, people."
Chris Traeger,I can't stop thinking about Ann and Millicent.
Chris Traeger,Motivational brigade coming through.
Chris Traeger,And I will assist you in any way that I can.
Chris Traeger,Community college.
Chris Traeger,"No, I can't help directly, but I am on your side."
Chris Traeger,"And if I'm alone with my thoughts, I go to a dark place."
Chris Traeger,I am so happy you guys are here.
Chris Traeger,Are you going to crawl my way?
Chris Traeger,"Speaking of potato chips, you and I are on for dinner tomorrow, yes?"
Chris Traeger,"Ah, Nirvana."
Chris Traeger,"But I do know this-- When we first started the seminar, I hoped to be able to engage you in the process."
Chris Traeger,You see Dr. Richard Nygard?
Chris Traeger,This isn't anything like your affair with Tom Haverford.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,Can I ask you why not?
Chris Traeger,This was literally the most beautiful and moving thing that I have ever heard.
Chris Traeger,We have so much work to do.
Chris Traeger,"Baby, if you can still hear me, I love you."
Chris Traeger,Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger,I'm a Nygardian too!
Chris Traeger,And by that measure I succeeded.
Chris Traeger,"No, I don't, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,What did April write? Where is April?
Chris Traeger,Do you have sisters?
Chris Traeger,Would you sign my cast?
Chris Traeger,"Come on, Andy, come on."
Chris Traeger,I think April will be a fine manager.
Chris Traeger,Her department is completely separate from ours.
Chris Traeger,I guess I'm proud of me.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, look, what you're feeling, right now is regret and shame."
Chris Traeger,"No, no, you're not fired, but we're definitely going to have to lower your salary."
Chris Traeger,We may never know conclusively which way works better.
Chris Traeger,By Lenny Kravitz.
Chris Traeger,"I bought my crib in Bloomington, and I am confident that it is literally the safest crib in the explored universe."
Chris Traeger,"Let me take you there, and you can talk to the salesperson."
Chris Traeger,"They serve a very important function, but they're not that great to look at."
Chris Traeger,"Counter-counteroffer you come with me, or I make you attend a four hour fax cover sheet protocol meeting."
Chris Traeger,You have aunts?
Chris Traeger,"Either way, it's a win for me."
Chris Traeger,"I just got Champion his dog food, cleaned your house, filed that paperwork you're officially April Ludgate Dwyer, installed a smoke detector, and now I'm back."
Chris Traeger,April.
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys."
Chris Traeger,I've always felt the same way myself.
Chris Traeger,"Another fascinating edition of ""katumts."""
Chris Traeger,You're gonna be okay.
Chris Traeger,"Ben, say hello."
Chris Traeger,"Well, you have all the qualifications."
Chris Traeger,You went to a four year college.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, uh Ben Wyatt."
Chris Traeger,How do you know him?
Chris Traeger,Guess who is standing in this room with me right now.
Chris Traeger,The testicles are like the ears of the genital system.
Chris Traeger,"You've got it, man."
Chris Traeger,How's the best municipal department in Pawnee?
Chris Traeger,I literally have 1000 questions.
Chris Traeger,We talked at your house.
Chris Traeger,Lot of people.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?"
Chris Traeger,"Ben is massively depressed, and he needs my help."
Chris Traeger,Maybe we go home and take the rest of it up on Monday.
Chris Traeger,This is so exciting.
Chris Traeger,"No, but Snerling does."
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Do you not remember this?
Chris Traeger,And it's only a 40 minute drive.
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, Ann, but I'm certain we did."
Chris Traeger,You're right.
Chris Traeger,Most people say 25.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I don't understand."
Chris Traeger,I've been overreacting.
Chris Traeger,I've tinkered with this recipe for years.
Chris Traeger,"Granted, it's been a long time since I've had a hamburger."
Chris Traeger,"All right, let's begin."
Chris Traeger,"Hop on board ""The Management Train."""
Chris Traeger,You don't think that Millicent was my soul mate?
Chris Traeger,We broke up last week.
Chris Traeger,I did!
Chris Traeger,April Ludgate.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, I'm just gonna pop over to Grain 'N Simple to get the very best ingredients for my burger."
Chris Traeger,Do you wanna come?
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, I'll try."
Chris Traeger,I was so proud of you.
Chris Traeger,For a 44 year old.
Chris Traeger,All aboard!
Chris Traeger,This is better.
Chris Traeger,Wow! Somebody's got a sharp palate.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I am so disappointed."
Chris Traeger,Perhaps he has a point.
Chris Traeger,And we've made some progress.
Chris Traeger,First stop Motivation Station.
Chris Traeger,I thought that you and I were gonna have a real challenge.
Chris Traeger,"No, I'm not cheating on you."
Chris Traeger,But I'm also not dating you.
Chris Traeger,It's a health food store.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,Oh. No.
Chris Traeger,"This isn't a shotgun wedding, although, yes, she is pregnant, and, yes, we did just decide to get married today."
Chris Traeger,"Theodore? We will not be needing that ring, but we would like to purchase this locket."
Chris Traeger,"We've never been very conventional, so why start now?"
Chris Traeger,"And then we got pregnant as friends, and then we fell in love."
Chris Traeger,"And when we did date, we broke up, but you didn't realize it, and that was very embarrassing for you."
Chris Traeger,She already has family there.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, how old is your son?"
Chris Traeger,Oh Here are those ankle weights I bought you that you liked so much.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, that's my name."
Chris Traeger,She went to sign the lease on our new home.
Chris Traeger,Ann didn't just go to Ann arbor to visit family.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I'm sorry."
Chris Traeger,I was getting gas.
Chris Traeger,"No, I don't remember it."
Chris Traeger,"We got a 58%, which as I'm saying it, sounds very clearly like we failed."
Chris Traeger,The more the merrier.
Chris Traeger,"Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs, get some endorphins going?"
Chris Traeger,I just was-- Oh!
Chris Traeger,How much?
Chris Traeger,Thank you!
Chris Traeger,Talking like friends.
Chris Traeger,Which you are.
Chris Traeger,"The commissary will continue to serve horrifying, artery-clogging hamburgers."
Chris Traeger,Death is the opposite of
Chris Traeger,I think it's literally the best score we could have hoped for.
Chris Traeger,It's a nine hour seminar over two days.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I think it's fantastic."
Chris Traeger,As soon as you learn to embrace the power of positive motivation.
Chris Traeger,"You guys, let's all have dinner together."
Chris Traeger,And it's a great place to raise a family.
Chris Traeger,I don't like thinking about death.
Chris Traeger,It's a good town.
Chris Traeger,And I have a new job lined up at the University of Michigan.
Chris Traeger,I just wanted to make sure that there were no hard feelings after I forced you to break up with Tom.
Chris Traeger,I am 44 years old.
Chris Traeger,'Cause it's just a real bugaboo of mine.
Chris Traeger,And it applies to everyone.
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,Look at us.
Chris Traeger,"Please write down what you hope to gain from the seminar, seal it in the envelope, and then we'll open it when it's over."
Chris Traeger,Go blue!
Chris Traeger,"So, the mayor asked me to step in as City Manager."
Chris Traeger,Enjoy.
Chris Traeger,"I humbly place before you my east meets west patented Traeger Turkey Burger, an Asian fusion burger made with Willow Farms organic turkey, a toasted taleggio cheese crisp, papaya chutney, black truffle aioli, and microgreens on a gluten free brioche bun."
Chris Traeger,My anxiety has kept me up for over 50 hours.
Chris Traeger,Excuse me?
Chris Traeger,"Okay, great."
Chris Traeger,I made everything worse.
Chris Traeger,"If Tom were a bag of flour, that flour would never grow up to be a happy, welladjusted loaf of bread."
Chris Traeger,They found nothing.
Chris Traeger,"Much less a bran muffin, which is the highest honor that flour can achieve."
Chris Traeger,Cucumber flower.
Chris Traeger,"Wait, that's a garnish."
Chris Traeger,I guess you're talking about my razor.
Chris Traeger,You're not supposed to eat that.
Chris Traeger,I'm going to say everyone.
Chris Traeger,"I shave my legs for swimming, and women's razors work better."
Chris Traeger,"For whatever reason, men's razor technology hasn't figured out how to properly contour the shinbone."
Chris Traeger,"I care about Ann very deeply, but I just don't know if I'm cut out to be a dad."
Chris Traeger,"You see, I think that's the only question that matters."
Chris Traeger,"And Leslie, I cannot wait to hear your new big idea."
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Chris Traeger,Does that make sense?
Chris Traeger,Look.
Chris Traeger,The silent killer.
Chris Traeger,"When people feel supported, they will literally explode with productivity."
Chris Traeger,"What about encouragement, appreciation, and smiles."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I disagree."
Chris Traeger,"You give Leslie her lockbox, and you get me in your hip pocket."
Chris Traeger,We are on a date.
Chris Traeger,Think of yourselves as engineers steering a locomotive of positivity that runs on team power.
Chris Traeger,"No office relationships, particularly between a supervisor and an employee."
Chris Traeger,The taxpayers pay us.
Chris Traeger,"You know, Leslie, Ben's really been going through something, and he's on a journey, so I don't think he's gonna be"
Chris Traeger,"Thank you for the woodworking lesson, Ron."
Chris Traeger,"I'm just saying, if you can't keep your mouth to yourself, I'm gonna have to suspend you."
Chris Traeger,This whole crib recall thing has got me literally rethinking everything I thought I knew about parenting.
Chris Traeger,And it is going phenomenally.
Chris Traeger,"What sleep method will you be using Ferber, Sears?"
Chris Traeger,"I really wish Ron would engage, but he exudes so much wisdom that I can learn parenting tips simply by being in his presence."
Chris Traeger,Someone like Ron is teaching even when they're not teaching.
Chris Traeger,All the rest of it is details.
Chris Traeger,Could someone else massage my shoulders?
Chris Traeger,"So, we can't have anything appearing even remotely scandalous."
Chris Traeger,"Indiana Breast Cancer Awareness Triathlon, 2009."
Chris Traeger,Came in fourth!
Chris Traeger,And it's not like we failed.
Chris Traeger,"I think there are people that will find the ""No Married Chicks"" zone both morally repugnant and hard to enforce."
Chris Traeger,Anyone?
Chris Traeger,Who wants a panini?
Chris Traeger,"Of course, I am gonna miss Indianapolis, which is the most wonderful city in America."
Chris Traeger,And stopping is certain death.
Chris Traeger,I'm a human being.
Chris Traeger,Sometimes I get blemishes.
Chris Traeger,"You know, I went to Jamm's with you because I also want to leave the right kind of legacy, and that includes Pawnee commons."
Chris Traeger,Gamechanger.
Chris Traeger,That idea is literally the greatest idea I've ever heard in my life.
Chris Traeger,And it's not that long a trip.
Chris Traeger,"And very well said, right up until that moment that you started babbling incoherently."
Chris Traeger,"You know that even after we leave Pawnee, Ann will always be your best friend."
Chris Traeger,BFF slideshow?
Chris Traeger,And I of course accepted immediately because Pawnee is literally the greatest town in the country.
Chris Traeger,"The worst possible thing we could do would be to stop, because if the campaign stops, we all stop."
Chris Traeger,That idea is terrible.
Chris Traeger,I absolutely think that we should keep campaigning.
Chris Traeger,I'm not perfect.
Chris Traeger,"Just the other day, Ben told me that he might want to socialize with somebody from the government and I said, ""I'm sorry. Not possible."""
Chris Traeger,"I did do 10,000 pushups last week."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Everyone?
Chris Traeger,"You know, we should get together soon."
Chris Traeger,"The tests and blood work came back, and the news is terrible."
Chris Traeger,I'm so excited to be working with you all again.
Chris Traeger,"Caution, Jeremy."
Chris Traeger,It is exactly because of that lewd photo that I am here.
Chris Traeger,Excuse me.
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Chris Traeger,Fantastic!
Chris Traeger,What a fun surprise.
Chris Traeger,"Great job, and very informative, but we need to stop now forever and pretend like this never happened."
Chris Traeger,Amazing.
Chris Traeger,And stop!
Chris Traeger,"But I have found a new quiz, and I think we should take it."
Chris Traeger,I'd love to catch up.
Chris Traeger,I know it didn't seem to go very well at the counselor's.
Chris Traeger,And I'd like you to consider it a good-bye gift from me to you.
Chris Traeger,I have an idea.
Chris Traeger,Take a look.
Chris Traeger,"No, and I didn't ask."
Chris Traeger,Because it's irrelevant.
Chris Traeger,I love Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I'm broken.
Chris Traeger,This is for your baby.
Chris Traeger,"I'd much rather do 5,000 pushups with a wonderful woman."
Chris Traeger,Sitting on my back to increase my resistance.
Chris Traeger,What if she was my personal best?
Chris Traeger,Which is what I'm worried about.
Chris Traeger,That is interesting.
Chris Traeger,Walking in parks can be very romantic.
Chris Traeger,Hello.
Chris Traeger,"And, right now, you need help."
Chris Traeger,Your inbox is literally filled with penises.
Chris Traeger,It's you.
Chris Traeger,And spoiler alert
Chris Traeger,"I'm saying that tomorrow during the seminar, April is going to have a classmate."
Chris Traeger,I need to go to the hospital and see a doctor right away.
Chris Traeger,"Otherwise, we are open to all kinds of liability."
Chris Traeger,I am legally required to katumts every department head.
Chris Traeger,Excuse me.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna have to jog while I digest this.
Chris Traeger,My legs aren't working.
Chris Traeger,"Me, too."
Chris Traeger,"We could engrave ""2014"" or ""TBD."""
Chris Traeger,"That trash can is the toilet, and the wood was the feces."
Chris Traeger,"No, I know you're not consciously teaching me anything."
Chris Traeger,"I'm trying to siphon off some of your calm, centered wisdom through metaphors."
Chris Traeger,- An organized child is a--
Chris Traeger,"Great call, Leslie Knope."
Chris Traeger,He oversees every department.
Chris Traeger,This place is outstanding!
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've never been ""katumtsed?"""
Chris Traeger,It simply can't happen.
Chris Traeger,"What do you say we take this whole ""date plus two other people"" thing up into the stratosphere?"
Chris Traeger,"What's the point in doing 10,000 pushups if you're gonna do them alone?"
Chris Traeger,Mmm.
Chris Traeger,I'm having a fantastic time.
Chris Traeger,And it's so bad for me.
Chris Traeger,Does it really even matter?
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,There's something wrong with my body.
Chris Traeger,This is literally the best thing I've ever eaten.
Chris Traeger,"Well, Ron, I can't accept."
Chris Traeger,With your life.
Chris Traeger,I just want April to become as great a department head as yourself.
Chris Traeger,"Now, I missed the first three Death Canoe films."
Chris Traeger,I couldn't do that to Leslie.
Chris Traeger,Paul is going to be recuperating for a while.
Chris Traeger,"No, that's insane."
Chris Traeger,"No, 60!"
Chris Traeger,"No, 20."
Chris Traeger,I would like to buy five DVDs of this.
Chris Traeger,Did we win?
Chris Traeger,But you're the opposition campaign manager.
Chris Traeger,"No, I find calzone fatty, and unnecessary."
Chris Traeger,Are we done?
Chris Traeger,"Okay, are you done?"
Chris Traeger,That's you guys.
Chris Traeger,Sixtime tour de France champion.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Whatever he wants.
Chris Traeger,Buddhist.
Chris Traeger,Boy.
Chris Traeger,"So, you've hit a bit of a rough patch, and I care about you, so I just want to make sure you're doing okay."
Chris Traeger,"When you think about it, we are already more married than most married people."
Chris Traeger,Sure.
Chris Traeger,We actually know each other quite well.
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson and April Ludgate, literally my two favorite people in the catalogued universe."
Chris Traeger,"It's not a great acronym, but it is a great seminar."
Chris Traeger,"Now that you run the Animal Control department, you have qualified for the Chris Traeger Management Training Seminar or ""Katumts."""
Chris Traeger,I am so sorry.
Chris Traeger,I set many personal bests just trying to keep up with her.
Chris Traeger,I think that Champion should stay on his leash.
Chris Traeger,There's unfamiliar terrain and strange smells.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, what's this?"
Chris Traeger,So you were living here when Reasonableism first swept in?
Chris Traeger,Last year I won an organic gardening contest.
Chris Traeger,"Great, let's do it!"
Chris Traeger,Oh! That is very flattering.
Chris Traeger,Does it tip over easily?
Chris Traeger,"On the contrary, she was faster than I was."
Chris Traeger,Why exactly is it a death canoe?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I relish your wit.
Chris Traeger,"Starting in my next term as city manager, I will give you one huge I.O.U., no questions asked."
Chris Traeger,That was a fantastic season finale and a show that is literally a neverending roller coaster of emotion.
Chris Traeger,"And get a refund, please."
Chris Traeger,"You know, can I have a look at that?"
Chris Traeger,"Andy, repeat after me."
Chris Traeger,"Actually, we don't want the ring."
Chris Traeger,And you scored a triple dragon on your song.
Chris Traeger,"""I run for April."""
Chris Traeger,"I'm sure they're great people, but strange."
Chris Traeger,How are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Maybe let's not?
Chris Traeger,"""I run for love."""
Chris Traeger,Me either!
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, will you marry me?"
Chris Traeger,Charge it.
Chris Traeger,We are going to buy this ring.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have your lockbox."
Chris Traeger,Perfect timing.
Chris Traeger,Nobody.
Chris Traeger,"Ann, that is a beautiful sentiment."
Chris Traeger,"As enjoyable as that was, I did find it odd."
Chris Traeger,You have his word.
Chris Traeger,"And this is riddled with spelling errors, but it is binding."
Chris Traeger,"You know, Ben, I really think you need to take a step back here."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins?
Chris Traeger,Unless there's something more going on here.
Chris Traeger,So delightful.
Chris Traeger,You beat Jamm in the final battle.
Chris Traeger,It's much better than any metaphor.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you should be happy!"
Chris Traeger,"Please, could you excuse us?"
Chris Traeger,Ben
Chris Traeger,"""I don't know anymore."""
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Ron for the crib and the advice."
Chris Traeger,It is so cool!
Chris Traeger,Waiter!
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,My own taste buds.
Chris Traeger,I already did.
Chris Traeger,"In fact, let me buy all of you a drink for being so welcoming today."
Chris Traeger,"So, uh, how you been?"
Chris Traeger,No problem.
Chris Traeger,You left me no choice.
Chris Traeger,"""Maybe we should."""
Chris Traeger,"On the other hand, there are some benefits to being married: Taxes, health insurance, and I don't have to feel weird when hotel employees call me ""Mr. Perkins."""
Chris Traeger,Well.
Chris Traeger,"I just don't understand ""the throwing away the wood"" metaphor."
Chris Traeger,Time for you to head it in.
Chris Traeger,What's the lesson?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie put a beautiful cross into the box, Jeremy."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I know!"
Chris Traeger,"""Ann Perkins."""
Chris Traeger,"Well, I've thought about it."
Chris Traeger,I've known you a long time.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, why did you throw that wood away?"
Chris Traeger,And I'm in.
Chris Traeger,"I want to raise a child, with all the ups and downs and challenges that comes with it."
Chris Traeger,Me too.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I guess your uter-you and my uter-me are now our uter-us."
Chris Traeger,Even Ben's dancing.
Chris Traeger,Look.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,You have a lovely store.
Chris Traeger,It's potty training.
Chris Traeger,I want to be a parent.
Chris Traeger,"Theodore, we would like to return that ring."
Chris Traeger,This is already so much more helpful than the last book on parenting I read: Rad Dads by Apolo Anton Ohno and Shaun White.
Chris Traeger,It's beautiful.
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Chris Traeger,How are you?
Chris Traeger,"But this is my stunningly gorgeous date, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,I'm very flattered.
Chris Traeger,Looks like things with Mona-Lisa are Continuing.
Chris Traeger,"Great, thanks."
Chris Traeger,I think getting some perspective would be good.
Chris Traeger,How are my two favorite people in this entire town?
Chris Traeger,"What I get from that is, when parenting, sometimes a subtle hand is more effective than a strong one."
Chris Traeger,Indeed.
Chris Traeger,Fair enough.
Chris Traeger,Is there anything else you need help with? Have you learned how to ride a bike yet?
Chris Traeger,"I'm proud of you, bud."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, happy."
Chris Traeger,Obviously.
Chris Traeger,The bad news one sounds like this.
Chris Traeger,"""All you need to do is guide it into place."""
Chris Traeger,The small victories.
Chris Traeger,Why is Ron wearing headphones?
Chris Traeger,"You drive a hard bargain, but you leave me no choice."
Chris Traeger,"Herbal smoothie, you have done it again."
Chris Traeger,I thought you were never gonna stop talking.
Chris Traeger,"But now that you have, Ann Perkins, will you marry me?"
Chris Traeger,Yeah!
Chris Traeger,Get in on this.
Chris Traeger,It's organically grown.
Chris Traeger,I don't like it as much as that other thing you said.
Chris Traeger,That was very strange what you just said.
Chris Traeger,I'll give it up for that.
Chris Traeger,"It is truly great to see all of you, huh?"
Chris Traeger,What a lovely thought.
Chris Traeger,It's great news!
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,I have to run.
Chris Traeger,I'mI'm a bit of a germaphobe.
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Chris Traeger,That is one motivated worker bee.
Chris Traeger,That literally went on forever.
Chris Traeger,Donna!
Chris Traeger,"If your team keeps this up, I think we can hold off on filling the Leslie void."
Chris Traeger,That's a healthier option.
Chris Traeger,Is that good?
Chris Traeger,It sounds bad.
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, she's agreed to go out on a date with you."
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,"Now, you must know her pretty well what gives?"
Chris Traeger,"No, it's kind of taken a back seat."
Chris Traeger,Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger,Ron.
Chris Traeger,Get filing.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, let's switch it up."
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,"Ann, could I talk to you for a minute?"
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Portobello mushrooms.
Chris Traeger,Sure you do.
Chris Traeger,"Simple, elegant, and costeffective."
Chris Traeger,There's no steak.
Chris Traeger,Tom Haverford. Who's your friend?
Chris Traeger,Dr. Saperstein.
Chris Traeger,"You got it, champ."
Chris Traeger,Hopefully that will help you with any sensitivity that may arise around your boob hats.
Chris Traeger,It's all I want to know.
Chris Traeger,How are you feeling?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,You are smart and capable.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I knew you were the man for the job."
Chris Traeger,What a magnificent flip-flop.
Chris Traeger,"Why does the cult call themselves ""The Reasonableists""?"
Chris Traeger,That was a tragic day.
Chris Traeger,Live strong.
Chris Traeger,"In any rate, I think Ben and I should accompany you tonight."
Chris Traeger,Tell me every single detail of your day.
Chris Traeger,Here you go.
Chris Traeger,"Drink up, because it has every herb in my herb belt."
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, I insist."
Chris Traeger,I need you to stop whatever it is you're doing and file as many of these as you can.
Chris Traeger,Jerry Gergich.
Chris Traeger,I love dates.
Chris Traeger,"Well, never fear."
Chris Traeger,I will get you Tylenol for your pain and shea butter for your belly.
Chris Traeger,And your voluptuous figure only means your body is working exactly as nature intended it.
Chris Traeger,I am so excited that you finally agreed to go out with me.
Chris Traeger,Anyway.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,And I believe you can accomplish anything.
Chris Traeger,"It has nipple cream, nipple pads, and also a special nipple pimple ointment in case you develop any pimples on your nipples."
Chris Traeger,Tell me about that.
Chris Traeger,It's from Kernsten's: the nipple people.
Chris Traeger,I would like to spend the rest of my life with you.
Chris Traeger,But I did notice that you're interested in reincarnation.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins
Chris Traeger,I love you.
Chris Traeger,"The reason that you're feeling nipple sensitivity is because your milk ducts in your nipples are opening up, which is why I bought you this nipple kit."
Chris Traeger,Let's do this right.
Chris Traeger,I've been reading up on nipples.
Chris Traeger,Let's go get an engagement ring.
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Donna!"
Chris Traeger,Is that better?
Chris Traeger,"There, it's all good."
Chris Traeger,"Councilman, you have to admit that that idea makes a lot of sense."
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,"I know that we should hate you because you destroyed our friend's business, but we love you so much."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God Should we?"
Chris Traeger,"You got it, Tom."
Chris Traeger,Massage train.
Chris Traeger,And I know what you're thinking.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, we could use this mug."
Chris Traeger,It's not that I want a massage.
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,"Look, we can use anything as a baby."
Chris Traeger,I'll be the caboose.
Chris Traeger,It's because you broke the law.
Chris Traeger,"Before we have him forcibly removed, you should know this, that one of our female employees, a nurse, examined the photo you sent her"
Chris Traeger,And Ron Swanson is the locomotive.
Chris Traeger,And you have the mumps.
Chris Traeger,You might wanna get that checked.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, boy."
Chris Traeger,There may be a method to their madness.
Chris Traeger,"It does seem to be very poorly run, but we've only been here for two minutes."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, would you like some salad?"
Chris Traeger,Try it.
Chris Traeger,I know what will loosen up our brains.
Chris Traeger,"They're all terrible, but you have them."
Chris Traeger,I think you've got several options.
Chris Traeger,I liked him.
Chris Traeger,I would be thrilled if we have a girl.
Chris Traeger,Would you like to join me?
Chris Traeger,I'm just about to go on my night jog.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, friends."
Chris Traeger,This was one of my running feet!
Chris Traeger,"Ow, this hurts!"
Chris Traeger,The whole department is fired.
Chris Traeger,You're fired!
Chris Traeger,Salad's good for you.
Chris Traeger,You're fired!
Chris Traeger,Mr.
Chris Traeger,This hurts!
Chris Traeger,Ah!
Chris Traeger,What is this?
Chris Traeger,Ah!
Chris Traeger,Ow!
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,There's more than one way to skin a cat.
Chris Traeger,Ow!
Chris Traeger,"Well, I exercise, and I exercise my mind."
Chris Traeger,That's a great idea!
Chris Traeger,Quick recap things were going wonderfully.
Chris Traeger,Ann found this place.
Chris Traeger,"It's where we bought our ""Sounds of Nature"" machine."
Chris Traeger,Frasier!
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Do you remember me?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Larry."
Chris Traeger,"I came in here looking for the Vanna White book on child care, I'd like to solve the puzzle of parenting."
Chris Traeger,"Could you show my friend, Ron, that amazing crib that you sold me?"
Chris Traeger,All right.
Chris Traeger,The Babylove L'il Sweetheart Safe 4 Ever and Ever model.
Chris Traeger,Would you mind?
Chris Traeger,We clicked on an emotional level.
Chris Traeger,"Are, too."
Chris Traeger,"And then suddenly, I just stopped hearing from her."
Chris Traeger,It's like the Oscars.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry?
Chris Traeger,Water balloon fight.
Chris Traeger,Is there an option other than yes or no?
Chris Traeger,We've been taking pictures all over City Hall to show our unborn baby where we met.
Chris Traeger,Do you remember the woman I told you about from the county commissioner's office?
Chris Traeger,Hydration pack!
Chris Traeger,I don't know what to say.
Chris Traeger,"So, Ben"
Chris Traeger,"Look, I know that this is just a silly quiz, but it is so discouraging to do so poorly."
Chris Traeger,"Hi, guys."
Chris Traeger,Leslie and Ben are engaged!
Chris Traeger,Leslie and Ben are engaged!
Chris Traeger,Nothing will ever come between them!
Chris Traeger,Leslie and Ben are engaged!
Chris Traeger,How about a little excitement?
Chris Traeger,What's so imporant?
Chris Traeger,"Come on, everybody!"
Chris Traeger,Sorry?
Chris Traeger,Why Calzone?
Chris Traeger,"Let me walk around with you as you tell everyone else so that I can share true joy being spread, please?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, is that what's upsetting you?"
Chris Traeger,And I can't tell you what it means to me that I'm the very first person that you chose to tell.
Chris Traeger,"Mm, the joy that I am feeling right now is profound and unmatched in the modern era."
Chris Traeger,This is very uncomfortable for me.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,And I try to keep up on current events.
Chris Traeger,I love connecting with someone.
Chris Traeger,"Ben, great news."
Chris Traeger,These people live on planet nutbrain.
Chris Traeger,"I know we haven't spent a lot of time together, but"
Chris Traeger,See you tonight!
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I've just had my first bad date.
Chris Traeger,I told
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, what are you doing here?"
Chris Traeger,Smoothie's ready!
Chris Traeger,"Today is perfect, and I love you."
Chris Traeger,Everything is amazing.
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Langman, we hear you, we understand you and we are going to do whatever we can to come to a solution."
Chris Traeger,And I will pour you a glass of flaxseed milk to wash it down.
Chris Traeger,"I know, isn't it awful? But it works wonderfully."
Chris Traeger,And I hope that this eases some of the pain of us moving away a little bit.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, I'll cut them in half for you."
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's not the most ethical thing that I've ever done, but on the flip side, Jamm is a big, mean dope."
Chris Traeger,I read something on raddadsolutions.net that there's a pressure point in the foot that could induce labor.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,He holds my life in his hand like a fragile little bird.
Chris Traeger,Look at us both standing on the cusp of fatherhood.
Chris Traeger,Wonderful.
Chris Traeger,"Speaking of which, how's the new gig coming?"
Chris Traeger,"Happy Valentine's Day, Pawnee."
Chris Traeger,"I am coming dressed as my greatest fear, because Dr."

Chris Traeger,Tom.
Chris Traeger,He's very wise.
Chris Traeger,"This has been a difficult year for me, romantically."
Chris Traeger,"For me, it is not happy."
Chris Traeger,But don't let my sadness diminish your night.
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, life is fleeting."
Chris Traeger,Fun.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I'd like you to teach me to build a crib.
Chris Traeger,Because I no longer trust anything other than my own two hands.
Chris Traeger,"It is debilitating, but exciting."
Chris Traeger,"And I've talked to some people, and you have the votes if you want the job."
Chris Traeger,The reason I ask is this town is gonna need a new city manager.
Chris Traeger,I see him five times a week.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I want to do things the Swanson way."
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wait."
Chris Traeger,"So, tell me."
Chris Traeger,Five huge IOUs.
Chris Traeger,I said the exact same thing.
Chris Traeger,"Excellent work, everyone! Particularly you, Ron."
Chris Traeger,"I don't want to seem overdramatic, but this is literally a battle for April's soul."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I propose a challenge to see whose motivational methods are more effective."
Chris Traeger,"My God, I've taught you so much already."
Chris Traeger,You have one very satisfied citizen.
Chris Traeger,What did you do for her?
Chris Traeger,Ben and I are launching a full investigation.
Chris Traeger,Is that a euphemism?
Chris Traeger,"The way the bill is drafted prohibits any government employee from teaching anything but abstinence, city wide."
Chris Traeger,Then great work.
Chris Traeger,"In fact, she's out in the hallway and wants to thank you herself."
Chris Traeger,"Actually, it's not."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, focus up, buddy."
Chris Traeger,Fine.
Chris Traeger,"I'm gonna die an anonymous, meaningless speck of dust."
Chris Traeger,"I'm going to die one day, probably, without ever having left my mark on this silly, little planet."
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,Goodbye.
Chris Traeger,And I want to apologize to all the women And Jerry.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,Do you admit that you're depressed?
Chris Traeger,Let me rub them.
Chris Traeger,It's been over 30 years since there's been any incident involving the Reasonableists.
Chris Traeger,"The Letters to Cleo t-shirt, the unshaven face, the Doc Martins, and your hair does not have that normal, uptight, rigid, inflexible Ben Wyatt sense of fun."
Chris Traeger,We're 100% on the same page.
Chris Traeger,"Millicent Gergich, Ann Perkins, Andy's professor lots of disappointment, but if I keep my body moving and my mind occupied at all times, I will avoid falling into a bottomless pit of despair."
Chris Traeger,"You are wildly, insanely depressed."
Chris Traeger,I have a very strict policy.
Chris Traeger,"If I could go back in time, and cut your eyeballs out, I would."
Chris Traeger,Mission accomplished?
Chris Traeger,"Well, you know, I don't know if it's because I'm in such a good mood or because of the charming Ann Perkins, but I am going to seriously consider that."
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Whales don't have feet.
Chris Traeger,How are you feeling today?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, not at all, Shauna MalwaeTweep."
Chris Traeger,You can't hide these things from friends.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we did not win."
Chris Traeger,"Good morning, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, I know, it's terrible."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you for your input, April, but the katumts requires that we follow a very specific syllabus."
Chris Traeger,This is 100% certified for realskis.
Chris Traeger,I have to do it.
Chris Traeger,Why am I so positive all the time?
Chris Traeger,You're all my little hydration packs.
Chris Traeger,It is.
Chris Traeger,That would be harassment.
Chris Traeger,Parks Department!
Chris Traeger,"And, full disclosure, I think they're bonkersfilled."
Chris Traeger,I want to find something that really motivates you.
Chris Traeger,Why do you want to achieve this goal?
Chris Traeger,Yes!

Chris Traeger,Dig.
Chris Traeger,Richard Nygard's award for Most Improved Patient for my psychotherapy sessions.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I really have to go to the bathroom."
Chris Traeger,You don't have to come in with me.
Chris Traeger,I was born with a blood disorder.
Chris Traeger,"I wanna hit the ground running, and your new mystery project is going to be the hydration pack that gets me to the finish line."
Chris Traeger,"And so effective immediately, all male employees must stop sending explicit photos to Ms. Perkins."
Chris Traeger,Nobody here compares to Millicent.
Chris Traeger,Except maybe Jerry.
Chris Traeger,Technically they share 50% of the same DNA.
Chris Traeger,Ben Wyatt.
Chris Traeger,I live on planet nut bran.
Chris Traeger,I love engaging them.
Chris Traeger,I love being surprised by them.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, your expertise is thrilling, and frankly, almost arousing, but the law is the law."
Chris Traeger,Bran and nuts are very helpful for your colon!
Chris Traeger,What about pizza?
Chris Traeger,I have never had a bad date.
Chris Traeger,Wha I'm on it.
Chris Traeger,They've all been either great or phenomenally great.
Chris Traeger,I think all of you should make as much money as the CEO of Google.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Chris Traeger,Stop it!
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt that I know, I just don't think he'd be happy sitting here faffing around."
Chris Traeger,And a good idea.
Chris Traeger,"That, literally, is the most moving thing I've ever heard."
Chris Traeger,"At Leslie's suggestion, I have made you deputy director of Animal Control within the Parks Department."
Chris Traeger,"You'll be amazing at it, and the best part, there is no confirmation hearing."
Chris Traeger,Nurses are the most undervalued members of our society by far.
Chris Traeger,It's So good running into you.
Chris Traeger,Never thought of it that way.
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,"So it doesn't destroy me, leaving me to die alone."
Chris Traeger,"But I am not in the nude now, am I?"
Chris Traeger,"In college, I was in a nude production of Cats."
Chris Traeger,I'm going.
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,I've posed nude.
Chris Traeger,I've dabbled in nude sculpture.
Chris Traeger,And I am certain that you will literally be the world's best mom.
Chris Traeger,"I exercise because, when I was a baby, I had a rare blood disorder, and I suppose I need to feel like my body's in tiptop shape Ah."
Chris Traeger,"You are caring, intelligent, and reliable."
Chris Traeger,And my parents were told that I had three weeks to live.
Chris Traeger,"And here I still am, some 2,000 odd weeks later, and I have enjoyed every one of them."
Chris Traeger,Is there anything we can do about that?
Chris Traeger,I will do it.
Chris Traeger,"No, personally, I enjoy a good artistic depiction of the human form."
Chris Traeger,"Not personally, no."
Chris Traeger,#NAME?
Chris Traeger,Leslie.
Chris Traeger,Could you pick up the pace a little bit?
Chris Traeger,I need to do it.
Chris Traeger,Because we're in a government building.
Chris Traeger,"Tonight's film is the 1986 horror camp classic, Murder At Blood Lake."
Chris Traeger,I'll go.
Chris Traeger,"So, take care of this situation."
Chris Traeger,"And that would be inappropriate, which is what I think Marcia is saying."
Chris Traeger,Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Andy.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, sorry."
Chris Traeger,"But before I can do that, I need to climb the Mount Everest of my mind."
Chris Traeger,"What else is there, really?"
Chris Traeger,"Run a four-minute mile, climb Mount Everest."
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Chris Traeger,"Herb, I just speedread both of your books."
Chris Traeger,"It's just a piece of paper and he only made it for me after I specifically asked for it while crying loudly, but It sure meant a lot to receive it."
Chris Traeger,You are a genius and an amazing motivator.
Chris Traeger,"In honor of Halloween, the city manager's office will be throwing a scary movie night in the courtyard."
Chris Traeger,Love and family.
Chris Traeger,"You are as ""in line"" as a person can be."
Chris Traeger,"Au contraire, mon frere."
Chris Traeger,"All my life, I have tried to achieve external goals."
Chris Traeger,"and I don't like feeling angry, my heart is racing, it's going at literally 45 beats per minute."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, everybody, great news."
Chris Traeger,What if I told you that I could make a turkey burger that tastes better than any other burger you've ever had?
Chris Traeger,What are you doing here?
Chris Traeger,"So if you were to sit on your couch all day watching cartoons and eating nothing but Cheetos, that's what he would want to do too."

Chris Traeger,I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
Chris Traeger,"""I, Chris Traeger, after several sustained hours of diarrhea, combined with violent coughing and a devastating fever, followed by even more diarrhea, have succumbed to the avian flu."""
Chris Traeger,I'm dead.
Chris Traeger,It's when you're most alert.
Chris Traeger,Prebroth is an amazing stage.
Chris Traeger,And why did they turn so quickly on this project?
Chris Traeger,Where did all these people come from?
Chris Traeger,"Every time I cleanse, I can literally feel the toxins leaving my body."
Chris Traeger,I'll go get him.
Chris Traeger,We left Jerry back at the gas station in Martinsville.
Chris Traeger,I just remembered.
Chris Traeger,But they're a good memento.
Chris Traeger,They're not exactly a summary of the party we ended up having.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys, I had these Tshirts made."
Chris Traeger,No spoilers.
Chris Traeger,"All right, if you'll excuse me, I found out this morning that I am playing a special role in this parade."
Chris Traeger,Dog whistle.
Chris Traeger,Just hang in there.
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, I was just trying to cheer you up."
Chris Traeger,This is great.
Chris Traeger,Everyone is having fun.
Chris Traeger,What a wonderful event.
Chris Traeger,I like it.
Chris Traeger,Dogs tend to take on the personalities of their owners
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, if I may"
Chris Traeger,I'm so sorry.
Chris Traeger,Tiny swivel.
Chris Traeger,See how it works?
Chris Traeger,Arigato.
Chris Traeger,That becomes a new public waiting room.
Chris Traeger,And we got rid of that giant pillar that was in front of your door.
Chris Traeger,Danger zone.
Chris Traeger,"Well, get over it, because it's gone."
Chris Traeger,You're gonna be more accessible than ever.
Chris Traeger,"Come on, guys."
Chris Traeger,"Wow, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,You're a brother japanophile?
Chris Traeger,The tea ceremony.
Chris Traeger,And who's this?
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,This is amazing.
Chris Traeger,What a pleasant surprise.
Chris Traeger,"Hello, there."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, how are you?"
Chris Traeger,But it's moot.
Chris Traeger,"Hello, hello."
Chris Traeger,Uhoh.
Chris Traeger,"But I do need to talk to you about a float that is in this parade, because I'm not sure that you're going to be"
Chris Traeger,Our investigation has revealed that things in Pawnee are much worse than we anticipated.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,It's such an amazing honor.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,I'm the Nipple King.
Chris Traeger,I need to talk to you.
Chris Traeger,Where's Leslie?
Chris Traeger,I will keep my eye on you from my circular desk where I can see everything.
Chris Traeger,Come on
Chris Traeger,Let me get off this call.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, everybody must be at Rangers weekend."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, Chief Fugleberg."
Chris Traeger,That's wonderful.
Chris Traeger,Maybe you should take the day off.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,Did he fail his test?
Chris Traeger,"You know, rest is very important."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Andy."
Chris Traeger,Did you know that lab rats who are deprived of rest grow tumors all over their bodies?
Chris Traeger,You should Google it.
Chris Traeger,"Councilwoman Knope is your merger czar, and in the binders that she's provided, you will find directions to your department in Pawnee that most closely matches your department in Eagleton."
Chris Traeger,It's horrifying.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, I'm Chris."
Chris Traeger,You gave him a home.
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Now we're going to a steakhouse.
Chris Traeger,Have you ever considered not eating that for breakfast?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,"We went to an insane bar, played football with the Colts."
Chris Traeger,You're gonna have to sell your shares in the Snakehole.
Chris Traeger,I just don't see any way around it.
Chris Traeger,Whoo!
Chris Traeger,"We're having the time of our lives, and I'm calling you to rub it in!"
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,girls what's my weakness?
Chris Traeger,"So Millicent and I are going to take a nice little stroll, and I'll be back soon."
Chris Traeger,Government employees can't use their power to enhance their personal wealth.
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Chris Traeger,I was wondering if you might make an exception for me?
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,I'm just so excited.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, I'm so sorry."
Chris Traeger,I'm back.
Chris Traeger,Why don't you sing to him?
Chris Traeger,I think he likes your music.
Chris Traeger,We looked at every alternative.
Chris Traeger,This is the only scenario that prevents Eagleton's financial crisis from spiraling throughout the entire region.
Chris Traeger,And it is a wrap.
Chris Traeger,Everyone in Pawnee is dead.
Chris Traeger,Including Councilman Jamm.
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,"If you just call out his name, he will come to you."
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,And he's your dog.
Chris Traeger,Just one second.
Chris Traeger,It's too delicious.
Chris Traeger,So remember to pace yourself.
Chris Traeger,So I will just say To Ron.
Chris Traeger,"There are so many things that I could say about Ron, but I think that the best man's speech should represent the groom."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, okay, okay."
Chris Traeger,Whoa!
Chris Traeger,"Now, they're basically grapes."
Chris Traeger,That's amazing.
Chris Traeger,It's nature's candy.
Chris Traeger,"I know that Ron doesn't want us to eat anything before the meat, but I smuggled in some candy."
Chris Traeger,That usually works.
Chris Traeger,Travelin' Ann Perkins! How was Bloomington?
Chris Traeger,#NAME?
Chris Traeger,I-I know.
Chris Traeger,I can't even follow my own advice.
Chris Traeger,You emailed everyone at City Hall and told them to come to a club that you own to buy alcohol that you invented.
Chris Traeger,"April, that is not a very good attitude."
Chris Traeger,"You know, the old Chris would've loved this super fit health goddess you guys are talking about."
Chris Traeger,So many negative words.
Chris Traeger,Andy.
Chris Traeger,"Starting now, you are nobody's shoeshine boy."
Chris Traeger,"April, listen."
Chris Traeger,"All right, officers, bolt the doors."
Chris Traeger,We are officially in lockdown mode.
Chris Traeger,The doors will not open until Leonard announces that this drill is complete.
Chris Traeger,"Starting now, you are an administrative assistant."
Chris Traeger,For three weeks.
Chris Traeger,Then back to shoes.
Chris Traeger,"Was all of this, all the sneaking around, the scandal, losing your job, Was it worth it?"
Chris Traeger,That was very hard to hear.
Chris Traeger,"""Eagleton: No money, mo' problems."""
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,I do like a good internal rhyme.
Chris Traeger,"""Step one insert the DVD scenario."""
Chris Traeger,"If you don't want to work for me, I'm not gonna force you."
Chris Traeger,You didn't have to do this.
Chris Traeger,Kyle-San! Arigato!
Chris Traeger,"Look, I get it."
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,"You're young, and trying isn't cool."
Chris Traeger,I've called you a cab.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, let's get you in the cab."
Chris Traeger,Come on.
Chris Traeger,Fancy this.
Chris Traeger,"Listen, I have meetings all day, but I'd love to chat with you."
Chris Traeger,You won't be alone.
Chris Traeger,An equal gender employment commission.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I don't think this is a good idea."
Chris Traeger,I think it's a fantastic idea.
Chris Traeger,But you guys had a great run.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, the dream team is dead."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,They have Michael Buble on retainer.
Chris Traeger,"""I can't get into details because it's superclassified."""
Chris Traeger,"""Please release April back to us permanently."""
Chris Traeger,I just need to process this.
Chris Traeger,That's terrific.
Chris Traeger,I have an amazing project for someone of your talents.
Chris Traeger,You are going to digitize the entire city archives up on the fourth floor.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna get that going right now.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, right, the commission."
Chris Traeger,"""God bless America."""
Chris Traeger,Can I call you?
Chris Traeger,Shauna MalwaeTweep has amazing dimples.
Chris Traeger,"Labels can be bad, but they can also be good."
Chris Traeger,I'm not really sure what our label is.
Chris Traeger,It was very confusing.
Chris Traeger,"It was like a date, but there were seven other people there."
Chris Traeger,"Recently, we engaged in something called a ""group hang."""
Chris Traeger,I don't entirely understand the behavior of young people.
Chris Traeger,I don't know what to call her.
Chris Traeger,"""Love, Bert Macklin, FBI."""
Chris Traeger,She's my special friend.
Chris Traeger,Andand I can ask Shauna MalwaeTweep to write an article about it for the Pawnee Journal.
Chris Traeger,And!
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna ask each department to send two people to a meeting today.
Chris Traeger,The lack of women in this government is criminal.
Chris Traeger,"""Warning: Toxic bleach"" is a good label."
Chris Traeger,Swivel!
Chris Traeger,"Now, I'll mull my options for the next few months, but I'd love you to keep an open mind."
Chris Traeger,"And 4,000 Facebook friends and a hot girlfriend."
Chris Traeger,"You'll travel, and you will meet interesting people."
Chris Traeger,"A few months ago, the thought of an infectious disease, even hypothetical, would have sent me careening towards Bummerville, but now I am infected with a killer virus, and I feel fine."
Chris Traeger,Ben?
Chris Traeger,There is quite literally nothing I would rather have in the world than a tour of the Parks and Recreation Department of the great City of Pawnee led by Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,Therapy!
Chris Traeger,Think about it.
Chris Traeger,"This desk is the epitome of the Swedish concept of jamstalldhet, or ""equality."""
Chris Traeger,It is fantastic to be here.
Chris Traeger,Imagine someone needs your attention.
Chris Traeger,Somebody say my name.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,"No, you couldn't remember your phone number, but you gave me your phone."
Chris Traeger,Swivel!
Chris Traeger,That is impossible.
Chris Traeger,Dream team!
Chris Traeger,I do not ride the bus.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,I ride my bicycle behind the bus as a windbreak.
Chris Traeger,"What is it, Jerry?"
Chris Traeger,This is Ben.
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"And you did a great job, superstar."
Chris Traeger,And dimples are a plus.
Chris Traeger,Someone else say something.
Chris Traeger,Dream team.
Chris Traeger,"But our great adventure reminded me that now I just want someone that values the important things in life, friendships, passion, happiness."
Chris Traeger,Let's do it!
Chris Traeger,"Ron, a moment."
Chris Traeger,"This, Mr. Director, is your new desk."
Chris Traeger,Everybody starts somewhere.
Chris Traeger,But I think you're smart.
Chris Traeger,"I'm gonna be going back to Indianapolis soon, and I think you should come work for me."
Chris Traeger,"Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh! Three, ten, bullock! Three, ten, bullock! Give it to me."
Chris Traeger,Perfect.
Chris Traeger,Would you like to have lunch? Are you a vegetarian? A vegan? A pescatarian? Not that it matters.
Chris Traeger,I have thousands of seconds.
Chris Traeger,You may be right about that.
Chris Traeger,I have me.
Chris Traeger,I'm not lonely.
Chris Traeger,And Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,Adios!
Chris Traeger,"My partner, Ben, is going to stick around for a little bit, and I will see you all later."
Chris Traeger,"I wanted to spend time with you, because I have to replace Ben as assistant city manager and I was giving you a tryout of sorts."
Chris Traeger,There it is.
Chris Traeger,Okay?
Chris Traeger,Okay?
Chris Traeger,"We're going to slap on a new coat of paint, we are going to fix that broken speaker system, and we are going to get those happy kids back up on the horses where they belong!"
Chris Traeger,Think of the government as a broken down carousel.
Chris Traeger,"Look, simply we are here to tinker with your budget."
Chris Traeger,Ben Wyatt.
Chris Traeger,What does that mean?
Chris Traeger,Ooh.
Chris Traeger,"People, we are here from the state budget office from Indianapolis."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, casualty update only four dead, two of whom were already gravely ill and brothers."
Chris Traeger,That family took a terrible hit.
Chris Traeger,"Well, that's great news."
Chris Traeger,"All right, pal, level with me."
Chris Traeger,What's going on?
Chris Traeger,I believe an ounce of that would literally kill me.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I don't think that will be necessary."
Chris Traeger,"I would love to, Jerry, but I'm afraid that I am busy."
Chris Traeger,"We have Haverford, Swanson, Dwyer Jerry forced his way in there somehow things are bound to get crazy."
Chris Traeger,Sky is the limit.
Chris Traeger,I told Ben he could do whatever he wants.
Chris Traeger,Upsidedown situps.
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,"Great exercise, and it literally lets me see the world from a different perspective."
Chris Traeger,"The world's my gymnasium, Ron."
Chris Traeger,But I will stop if it makes you uncomfortable.
Chris Traeger,It's very catchy.
Chris Traeger,Could you hold me while I dismount?
Chris Traeger,Joan gotcha!
Chris Traeger,"That said, the show was pretty lively."
Chris Traeger,I am horrified at her tactics.
Chris Traeger,That was despicable!
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, Maid of Honor, are you ready for the bachelorette party?"
Chris Traeger,"Ben, it has been an honor watching you work today."
Chris Traeger,It's been like watching Leonardo work.
Chris Traeger,Da Vinci or DiCaprio.
Chris Traeger,You're that good.
Chris Traeger,"Ben, that's a great idea."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, you know what?"
Chris Traeger,I know who I'm gonna use to calculate tax and tip.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey, little guy."
Chris Traeger,He can't hear me.
Chris Traeger,"You're really getting it done, man!"
Chris Traeger,"Way to be, Ron!"
Chris Traeger,"Then, you can come with us on our first 3 to 6 dates"
Chris Traeger,"I would like to spend the next 2 to 4 days with you so you can get to know me better, to find out if I'm the kind of person who's good enough for your daughter."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, this is your night."
Chris Traeger,And that is a sacred thing.
Chris Traeger,You should keep an open mind.
Chris Traeger,See you later!
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,I can literally see my face in my shoes.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, that was an amazing shoeshine."
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Let your brain unlock the door to your heart's future.
Chris Traeger,Andy just gave me a phenomenal shoeshine and I did not know that you two once lived together.
Chris Traeger,I made that expression up when I was 14.
Chris Traeger,Still in use today.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,By me.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, a word?"
Chris Traeger,But now I see that this is truly where he belongs.
Chris Traeger,I had an amazing lunch.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, thank you."
Chris Traeger,Gotta jam.
Chris Traeger,"But, even better?"
Chris Traeger,Your daughter was delightful company.
Chris Traeger,"Now, I don't want to put you in an awkward position, but"
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Chris Traeger,But you are her father.
Chris Traeger,That's so true.
Chris Traeger,"I have an organic, gluten free soy bone for you."
Chris Traeger,"Champion, come here, boy."
Chris Traeger,Champion!
Chris Traeger,"Come on, let's play."
Chris Traeger,We do what you want to do.
Chris Traeger,I've already passed the kale salad I had.
Chris Traeger,This is a big deal!
Chris Traeger,And it literally broke my heart.
Chris Traeger,"Ron has taken initiative, and he is leading the meeting."
Chris Traeger,It's good to see you.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I won't keep you guys."
Chris Traeger,"Ah, so random, right? What a story! I felt like my heart was whitewater rafting."
Chris Traeger,Something healthy! A cherry tomato.
Chris Traeger,How did you two meet?
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, there."
Chris Traeger,Well.
Chris Traeger,Nope.
Chris Traeger,A gumball.
Chris Traeger,I found no inaccuracies.
Chris Traeger,"I hate to say this, but Ann Perkins has terrible taste in rings."
Chris Traeger,What what is this?
Chris Traeger,There are three of them.
Chris Traeger,It's a toe ring with a brown gemstone?
Chris Traeger,Is this a ruby that's gone bad?
Chris Traeger,I thought there were only two.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,It's been great talking to you.
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Chris Traeger,"Listen, as I said earlier, I want keep everything above board in regards to my relationship with your daughter."
Chris Traeger,It's just a picture.
Chris Traeger,There's nothing in the world we can't accomplish if we try.
Chris Traeger,"See, I like to take each day at a time."
Chris Traeger,Mortality.
Chris Traeger,I truly wish her all the best.
Chris Traeger,She really was delightful.
Chris Traeger,Mwah.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, little tip, there is fat in the eggnog."
Chris Traeger,I'm fine.
Chris Traeger,"If therapy has taught me anything, it's that I need to face my fears, even when my fears are engaged to a man with the chiseled jawline of a young me."
Chris Traeger,Thanks so much.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, boy."
Chris Traeger,How was the ride?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey, you want me to show you something?"
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's called the ""Good Earth Salad,"" but really, it's just cheese, toffee, and gummy bear worms."
Chris Traeger,This town is really unhealthy.
Chris Traeger,I actually think it's something else.
Chris Traeger,"Back in the day, this was all we had."
Chris Traeger,"We'd go into a town, we'd fix problems."
Chris Traeger,We'd go back to some rundown motel.
Chris Traeger,Platz.
Chris Traeger,Steh Auf.
Chris Traeger,"See, it's pretty cool, huh?"
Chris Traeger,"I offered Ron a job last month, and he turned me down."
Chris Traeger,April Ludgate.
Chris Traeger,Would you like me to teach you?
Chris Traeger,"But now, Ann and Leslie are our real partners."
Chris Traeger,"Just so you know, we're thinking of moving."
Chris Traeger,"Well, as you may know, Millicent Gergich ended our relationship last night, which was disappointing."
Chris Traeger,But here's why it may be the greatest thing that ever happened.
Chris Traeger,Don't know where yet.
Chris Traeger,"Maybe Michigan, to be with Ann's family."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,you earned them.
Chris Traeger,There's no logical explanation.
Chris Traeger,You're a good friend.
Chris Traeger,For looking out for me tonight.
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Ben."
Chris Traeger,How are you doing?
Chris Traeger,We are having a moment.
Chris Traeger,I can't believe how alike we are.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I have made you a project leader."
Chris Traeger,I'll see you tomorrow.
Chris Traeger,What would you do?
Chris Traeger,Any activity in the world.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, you're next."
Chris Traeger,What about for the children?
Chris Traeger,There you go.
Chris Traeger,"Trust me, you'll love it."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, Chris Traeger feelings update I'm now feeling that your guests are getting a little antsy."
Chris Traeger,"It is crucial that you and I spend a day spiritually engaged, and consider what it would really mean to work together."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you and I are very different people, and we have often been at odds."
Chris Traeger,"So as all time best man, I suggest we raise a cone to Jerry Gergich."
Chris Traeger,"All that matters is that you got married, and you're happy."
Chris Traeger,"You and I will embark on a quick session of heart rate meditation, focusing on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra."
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,There is one more step in the vetting process.
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson, it is my pleasure to inform you that you are a finalist for the job of Assistant City Manager."
Chris Traeger,Neither can I.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, you can go."
Chris Traeger,We need a five-minute break.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Chris Traeger,It is!
Chris Traeger,It's an experimental fabric called bumbleflex.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,"Um, one small announcement: Due to a tragic misunderstanding, the prettiest pig beauty pageant has been replaced by a pork rib barbecue competition."
Chris Traeger,"As you know, the founder's week festivities kick off tomorrow."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, fellow Pawneeans."
Chris Traeger,To Tom Haverford.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wear your yoga pants."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Jim, Chris Traeger."
Chris Traeger,I need a favor.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys!"
Chris Traeger,I have got to run.
Chris Traeger,Google those rat tumors!
Chris Traeger,"Andy, if it wasn't for you and April, Champion would still be back at the pound."
Chris Traeger,Unless you also want to go get dinner.
Chris Traeger,We need to talk.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, I got your email."
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, Donna, but Millicent's company will keep me warm."
Chris Traeger,Donna Meagle!
Chris Traeger,"All right, well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me."
Chris Traeger,I know how much you value silence.
Chris Traeger,"I'm going to be going to a seminar on the art of the japanese tea ceremony Or chakai the Pawnee community college, and I thought you might like to come with me."
Chris Traeger,Just the man I wanted to see.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,"Welcome to Tom's bachelor party, held in a white airplane hangar from the ice planet Hoth, replete with dangling, beautiful aerialists."
Chris Traeger,"Together, as a town, we lost an amount of weight equal to 800 pregnant manatees."
Chris Traeger,We're throwing a birthday party for a new city.
Chris Traeger,"Happy birthday, New Pawnee."
Chris Traeger,"When we were state auditors, we had an amazing system."
Chris Traeger,They preferred Jim.
Chris Traeger,Like a majestic alleyoop.
Chris Traeger,Jim gave them Colts tickets and autographed jerseys.
Chris Traeger,I gave them tours of the state house.
Chris Traeger,You're all amazing!
Chris Traeger,Teamwork.
Chris Traeger,Jim Irsay and I became friends while volunteering to mentor Indianapolis teens.
Chris Traeger,Really?
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I want you to meet Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay."
Chris Traeger,"Guys, come on over here."
Chris Traeger,"Today, we are not just merging two towns."
Chris Traeger,One activity per bachelor.
Chris Traeger,"Tonight, everyone gets the bachelor party they never had."
Chris Traeger,New idea!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, hey, hey, don't say that."
Chris Traeger,"I mean, how many of you were actually born in Pawnee?"
Chris Traeger,Does it really matter?
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,May you and Leslie find eternal happiness together.
Chris Traeger,This calls for some celebratory lunges.
Chris Traeger,One two
Chris Traeger,"To our new Lord of Catan, Ben Wyatt, a great friend and a wonderful man."
Chris Traeger,I want to propose a toast.
Chris Traeger,"Now, come on."
Chris Traeger,Gather round.
Chris Traeger,"You will bring that painting in tomorrow morning, and surrender it to Marcia Langman, and that's that."
Chris Traeger,Well Leslie?
Chris Traeger,"But, Tom, this is Ben's night."
Chris Traeger,"Guys, come on over here."
Chris Traeger,All right.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Get yourself together and go out there and be the woman you always knew you could be.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, good."
Chris Traeger,"Everyone, meet your meat."
Chris Traeger,"Now, in two weeks, you can Leslie Knope!"
Chris Traeger,I am much faster than you!
Chris Traeger,There is nothing that I like more than running for charity.
Chris Traeger,I don't know.
Chris Traeger,"I saw her crying, and so I helped."
Chris Traeger,What did you wanna talk to me about?
Chris Traeger,I have bumbleflex!
Chris Traeger,"Millicent Gergich, biking for charity is literally one of my interests on Facebook."
Chris Traeger,Give me the flash drive.
Chris Traeger,"""To whom it may concern, dear Chris, there is an emergency regarding the Parks Department, and April may just be the only person who can help."""
Chris Traeger,Sure enough.
Chris Traeger,Go home and give me the flash drive.
Chris Traeger,"This feels almost perfect, but I don't think your core has maximized elasticity."
Chris Traeger,You never had one before you were married to Wendy?
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, great job."
Chris Traeger,I'm your dad's boss.
Chris Traeger,And his much younger friend.
Chris Traeger,"You're exactly the person that I most want to talk to, right at this moment."
Chris Traeger,And lunge.
Chris Traeger,Have you given my offer any more thought?
Chris Traeger,I retroactively accept your original offer.
Chris Traeger,Let's go!
Chris Traeger,"Oh, let me be on rings."
Chris Traeger,This is a nasal spray.
Chris Traeger,I love what they symbolize.
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,"You would coordinate my professional and personal schedule, and we would give you a small relocation fee for your move to Indianapolis."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, these aren't bad."
Chris Traeger,Thank you. Goodbye everbody.
Chris Traeger,It's made out of synthetic bees' wings.
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,That is literally the best news that I've heard all day.
Chris Traeger,Anyway You're not supposed to be here.
Chris Traeger,You're suspended.
Chris Traeger,N O.
Chris Traeger,It is excellent having the old band back together again.
Chris Traeger,You are specifically prohibited from doing your job.
Chris Traeger,Leslie.
Chris Traeger,"Well, you would work at the state house."
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,Your entrepreneurial spirit.
Chris Traeger,I enjoy you.
Chris Traeger,It is literally the comfiest couch you've ever been on.
Chris Traeger,Which makes what I'm about to say even sadder.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's true."
Chris Traeger,You are exemplary government employees.
Chris Traeger,I love both of you.
Chris Traeger,Neither of those things.
Chris Traeger,How's my best buddy? Just bought this.
Chris Traeger,"I am, of course, shocked And not just because Ben usually prefers tall brunettes."
Chris Traeger,Cranium.
Chris Traeger,It's a board game.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh."
Chris Traeger,"Sorry, I keep myself very well hydrated, and my bladder is the size of a thimble."
Chris Traeger,I urinate roughly 12 times a night.
Chris Traeger,Don't keep him too long.
Chris Traeger,Have you heard of it? It is literally the most fun I have ever had.
Chris Traeger,I need someone to be here when I take my multivitamin.
Chris Traeger,"What do you say, after work, you, me, whiskey, wheatgrass, Cranium? Ron?"
Chris Traeger,"Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Leslie Knope, who is running for city council."
Chris Traeger,Is this Deirdre Splatterfork?
Chris Traeger,That is literally the most beautiful name I have ever heard.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, will do."
Chris Traeger,Why would he do that?
Chris Traeger,There's a choking hazard.
Chris Traeger,"You know what I just read? Right now, our baby is the size of a green olive."
Chris Traeger,Why pin it?
Chris Traeger,Why?
Chris Traeger,Isn't that wild?
Chris Traeger,I'm launching a full investigation into the extent of your wrongdoing.
Chris Traeger,Please report Monday first thing to the council chambers for your ethics trial and subsequent punishment.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you can take the guest room, and, Ben, you have to sleep on my couch."
Chris Traeger,I would love to have you stay with me.
Chris Traeger,"And also, there is a pretzel stand over there that serves, literally, the best pretzel I've ever had."
Chris Traeger,He did.
Chris Traeger,And he told me that I would be crazy to let you get away.
Chris Traeger,Should we take a long walk?
Chris Traeger,And he told me how great you are.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, he's great."
Chris Traeger,Minigolf.
Chris Traeger,"My point is, Ethel, that Ann's pregnant."
Chris Traeger,And I'm the baby daddy!
Chris Traeger,You don't seem very excited for us.
Chris Traeger,I agree.
Chris Traeger,"Wait a minute, what time is it? Has she landed yet?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh, eventually, she's going to have to go back to work."
Chris Traeger,A green olive.
Chris Traeger,Nonsense.
Chris Traeger,"We talked to, like, 50 people, and, frankly, not one of them gave us the reaction that we were hoping for."
Chris Traeger,There's no reason to drive all the way back home.
Chris Traeger,I've got a perfectly good condo right here in the city.
Chris Traeger,"You know, I've never moved this slowly before."
Chris Traeger,This is a disaster.
Chris Traeger,You're not into football?
Chris Traeger,I knew there was something wrong with you.
Chris Traeger,I knew it.
Chris Traeger,"I knew it, knew it, knew it."
Chris Traeger,I would like a local beer.
Chris Traeger,I'd like it in a bottle.
Chris Traeger,I'd like the bottle to be cold.
Chris Traeger,Double nonsense.
Chris Traeger,We are so glad you're back.
Chris Traeger,Would you like one?
Chris Traeger,A little high in sodium.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, right."
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,It's Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,It's a chance to start over.
Chris Traeger,I was dying earlier today.
Chris Traeger,And then I died.
Chris Traeger,Now I'm dead.
Chris Traeger,I had to cancel a date with Shauna MalwaeTweep.
Chris Traeger,And I really like her.
Chris Traeger,You wanna guess who it is?
Chris Traeger,I have found my assistant city manager.
Chris Traeger,Councilman Houser I was just looking for you.
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Do you think she'll still like me now that I'm dead?
Chris Traeger,I cannot be stopped.
Chris Traeger,Has anybody talked to Tom?
Chris Traeger,I can't even imagine what that tiny little man must be feeling like.
Chris Traeger,We need to call him.
Chris Traeger,We must reach out to him.
Chris Traeger,I can't do it.
Chris Traeger,"Fire is cleansing, and true wealth is measured by the amount of love in your life."
Chris Traeger,"If I had to have anybody tell me that I had cancer, I would want it to be me."
Chris Traeger,How's the recall fight going?
Chris Traeger,Mm.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,"Good nose, Ron."
Chris Traeger,Tammy Swanson is here.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Chris Traeger,I can literally make anything sound positive.
Chris Traeger,I should've let you guess.
Chris Traeger,I'm just so excited.
Chris Traeger,This is the best possible job for me.
Chris Traeger,It's still just our thing.
Chris Traeger,It'll always be just our thing.
Chris Traeger,That's why it's so wonderful and why we'll love it so much.
Chris Traeger,"I prefer ""Chickpea."""
Chris Traeger,"Yes, exactly."
Chris Traeger,"Well, that was quick and to the point."
Chris Traeger,Here's a tip.
Chris Traeger,"The key to a healthy urethra, radishes."
Chris Traeger,What laptop?
Chris Traeger,Good night.
Chris Traeger,"Well, now I'm up."
Chris Traeger,You wanna Boggle?
Chris Traeger,I just assumed you were lying.
Chris Traeger,I would have preferred a chickpea or a cherry tomato.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God, this is real."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope submitted that receipt for reimbursement.
Chris Traeger,Taxpayers' money is not meant to be spent on a romantic getaway.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, God, Ron."
Chris Traeger,I am so sorry.
Chris Traeger,I'll let you get at it.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"Life is precious, and every day is a miracle."
Chris Traeger,"Boy, oh, boy, we live interesting lives, filled with unexpected challenges."
Chris Traeger,Ha ha!
Chris Traeger,100 dollars.
Chris Traeger,Someone has a slug infestation?
Chris Traeger,Spin team!
Chris Traeger,This is unbelievable.
Chris Traeger,I have here a receipt from Pawnee Supersuites Motel.
Chris Traeger,She'll be my next witness.
Chris Traeger,We're all winners.
Chris Traeger,"Ha, that crazy and impractical plan may have to wait."
Chris Traeger,It's almost like being in quicksand.
Chris Traeger,"I don't usually poison my body with dark alcohol, but this whiskey is excellent!"
Chris Traeger,"Well, I should get back to my office."
Chris Traeger,As long as I have one.
Chris Traeger,Peace.
Chris Traeger,I'm a rolling stone.
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Let's get this phone party started.
Chris Traeger,For example?
Chris Traeger,I'm sure there are.
Chris Traeger,"Sorry I'm late, guys."
Chris Traeger,"No, you certainly cannot."
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,"Andy, he's kissing me."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'll see you when I see you."
Chris Traeger,"We're all just molecules, floating around in random patterns Devoid of meaning."
Chris Traeger,April?
Chris Traeger,"When Ben told me that you had won the bid, I was wildly ecstatic, and I had to come up here and celebrate with you."
Chris Traeger,There is literally nothing in this world that you cannot do.
Chris Traeger,"I believe that you certainly received special treatment, and I think that you may even be guilty of bribery."
Chris Traeger,What a gorgeous herbaceous medley.
Chris Traeger,I think that you began your relationship with Ben Wyatt earlier than you're saying.
Chris Traeger,"Romantic relationships between superiors and their employees lead to fraud, corruption, and misuse of public funds."
Chris Traeger,It is an important rule that exists in every government.
Chris Traeger,"It's not my rule, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,"Uh, yes, sir."
Chris Traeger,I did call you.
Chris Traeger,Ohh.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
Chris Traeger,Ohh.
Chris Traeger,This is the moment we were dreaming of: you and me and our baby.
Chris Traeger,Would you like a vitamin?
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,"Welcome, welcome, welcome."
Chris Traeger,B12?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,Evening primrose oil?
Chris Traeger,Willow bark?
Chris Traeger,Magnesium?
Chris Traeger,You sure?
Chris Traeger,Knope has a pattern of becoming involved with her coworkers.
Chris Traeger,Really good for hangovers.
Chris Traeger,I take care of my body above all else.
Chris Traeger,It seems that Ms.
Chris Traeger,Good ears.
Chris Traeger,"Diet, exercise, supplements, and positive thinking."
Chris Traeger,How long were you two lovers?
Chris Traeger,Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.
Chris Traeger,I believe I am that human being.
Chris Traeger,"I do not know, but I'll assume that that is a yes."
Chris Traeger,"Mr. Haverford, would you consider Leslie Knope a good employee?"
Chris Traeger,So what brings you here so early?
Chris Traeger,Great.
Chris Traeger,Why don't we go to this rustic diner that I know? We can have egg white omelets and we can continue to talk about us.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, I have a great idea."
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna listen to some ocean sounds and do some chin-ups.
Chris Traeger,"And well, I'm back now."
Chris Traeger,"I mean, I never meant to hurt you."
Chris Traeger,And Tom and his weird feud with our doctor.
Chris Traeger,"Last march, I witnessed Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford engaged in a passionate yet tender kiss."
Chris Traeger,Everybody's the best.
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Knope, that is all."
Chris Traeger,"And did you break any local, state, or federal law in an effort to cover up your relationship with Ben Wyatt?"
Chris Traeger,I have never felt so low.
Chris Traeger,"I admire and respect you, and dragging you through an ethics trial is filling me with sadness."
Chris Traeger,"Actually, I'm quite miserable."
Chris Traeger,Isn't that great?
Chris Traeger,It is snowing outside.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,I didn't know you were working today.
Chris Traeger,Good morning!
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Chris Traeger,That's great.
Chris Traeger,"Now, here's a piece of information that is interesting."
Chris Traeger,"Ann is pregnant, and it's my baby."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, the mini calzone?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wait!"
Chris Traeger,I'm very sad.
Chris Traeger,Please stop talking.
Chris Traeger,I have a Postit for you.
Chris Traeger,"It says, ""Great job!"""
Chris Traeger,It was literally just a small calzone.
Chris Traeger,Great job.
Chris Traeger,There you go.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, in the grand scheme of things, who cares?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I know."
Chris Traeger,I'm so so sorry.
Chris Traeger,So I may have offered you a job that I have no authority to offer.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, it's Tom!"
Chris Traeger,"Turns out that Bobby Newport, if he beats Leslie, is going to appoint his own city manager."
Chris Traeger,I went to my herbalist and got two B12 shots.
Chris Traeger,"And then I ate an unreasonable amount of St. John's wort, and my herbalist took this weird bee pollen paste rubbed it around my gums."
Chris Traeger,And now my mouth feels like a spaceship.
Chris Traeger,That's hilarious.
Chris Traeger,Next question did you ever receive special treatment as a result of your relationship with Ben Wyatt?
Chris Traeger,I just never thought that I would get to make this announcement.
Chris Traeger,It's a very special day.
Chris Traeger,No one's thinking that.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Donna."
Chris Traeger,I'd like you to get me some more Postits.
Chris Traeger,"So, what's the plan now?"
Chris Traeger,I'd like them in multiple colors.
Chris Traeger,"My goodness, you're observant."
Chris Traeger,I'd like green.
Chris Traeger,I'd like yellow.
Chris Traeger,I was not.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,Do not buy orange.
Chris Traeger,Yesterday.
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Knope, on what day did your relationship with Ben Wyatt begin?"
Chris Traeger,I have plenty of orange.
Chris Traeger,It's happening right now.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,"And if I don't mantain an extremely high dosages of herbal remedies, I will get very depressed."
Chris Traeger,And stress leads to depression.
Chris Traeger,This is stressful.
Chris Traeger,"oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,I could use that for a romantic night with Millicent Gergich.
Chris Traeger,"Out of my way, suckers."
Chris Traeger,"As city manager, I play no favorites."
Chris Traeger,"But as a private citizen, I am free to support whomever I choose, and I choose to support team Knope because they're the best."
Chris Traeger,I do not want orange.
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Swanson, do you, as you claimed, have evidence linking Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt to law breaking?"
Chris Traeger,"May I remind you that you are under oath, and if you lie, I will fire you and have you prosecuted."
Chris Traeger,And I am very happy that I have not uncovered any additional evidence of unethical behavior.
Chris Traeger,April.
Chris Traeger,Nice touch.
Chris Traeger,Oh! Sure.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, fine."
Chris Traeger,What else?
Chris Traeger,"Well, I took him to PetSmart."
Chris Traeger,The point of the barbecue was to thank the department.
Chris Traeger,Ben's not here.
Chris Traeger,It was an employee appreciation barbecue.
Chris Traeger,"Ben, is there something we can do? Damn it."
Chris Traeger,I wish there was something we could do.
Chris Traeger,"According to Leslie's binder, she and April are making even better time than the guys do on a normal day."
Chris Traeger,Rules are rules.
Chris Traeger,Us.
Chris Traeger,Me.
Chris Traeger,You.
Chris Traeger,"I'll say a word, and then you say the first thing that pops into your mind."
Chris Traeger,Let's play a word association game.
Chris Traeger,"I got him various toys, got him shots, got him groomed, and gave him plenty of exercise."
Chris Traeger,He's healthier than ever.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I gave you the chance to become assistant city manager."
Chris Traeger,"And you chose to stay here, which is fine."
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,"But if you're going to lead the department, you occasionally have to lead the department."
Chris Traeger,And I say that as one of your closest colleagues and dearest friends But also as your boss.
Chris Traeger,I'm much more receptive to new ideas when my heart rate is still elevated.
Chris Traeger,I love Michael Buble.
Chris Traeger,This is how I fight depression.
Chris Traeger,Band!
Chris Traeger,You should take a look at the last page of the transcript.
Chris Traeger,it's on the record.
Chris Traeger,I'm already working with a Real Estate agent to find an octagonal house.
Chris Traeger,"I've done some reading, and an octagon is the optimal shape for a home in terms of energy flow."
Chris Traeger,"I tried to talk him out of it, but His mind was made up."
Chris Traeger,"Look, my job is to protect the government from fraud and corruption."
Chris Traeger,I was just doing my job.
Chris Traeger,I hope that you can understand that.
Chris Traeger,What a hilarious word.
Chris Traeger,It reminds me of a ridiculous donkey.
Chris Traeger,He's the best.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,April Ludgate.
Chris Traeger,He's a mutt.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, I love it when you pull rank."
Chris Traeger,Tell me now while I sit on this boulder.
Chris Traeger,Literally two of my favorite people on earth.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry that I had to cancel lunch.
Chris Traeger,"'Cause your actions wounded me to my core, which is not easy since the bulk of my workouts are focused on core strengthening."
Chris Traeger,My hands are tied.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,Good job with that.
Chris Traeger,I have a stepbrother who lives in London and 2.8% body fat.
Chris Traeger,What else?
Chris Traeger,But we will get through this.
Chris Traeger,You are An excellent government employee.
Chris Traeger,"And more importantly, you're the only person I've ever met who's worthy of being Ben's girlfriend."
Chris Traeger,"You know, the meeting that Ben and I had"
Chris Traeger,Classic And depressing.
Chris Traeger,Ich bin ein three legged dog.
Chris Traeger,"Half amazing, half terrific."
Chris Traeger,But I think we're probably gonna get our own place.
Chris Traeger,"Well, um, some of these expenditures are questionable."
Chris Traeger,I feel that some structural changes could really unlock this department's potential.
Chris Traeger,"I'm making you head of Public Relations, which means you'll be leading the daily briefing sessions."
Chris Traeger,I'll go.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, this is just a drill, but I am having so much fun pretending it's real."
Chris Traeger,"April, you are too valuable to just be Ron's assistant."
Chris Traeger,I am part of the problem.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,I just assumed that some of the departments would send women.
Chris Traeger,"So from now on, you are a multitasking executive aide, assisting the entire office."
Chris Traeger,I love good people.
Chris Traeger,Because he's a good person.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I just wanna say that you are a wonderful employee and a terrific human being."
Chris Traeger,I'll stop.
Chris Traeger,Why do I want to help him?
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I want to help you win her over."
Chris Traeger,"No, you told me yesterday."
Chris Traeger,"So you love April, and she has a new boyfriend, right?"
Chris Traeger,"They perfectly contour to the human foot, and the human foot is the ultimate technology."
Chris Traeger,They are for adventure racing.
Chris Traeger,Those are sports sandals.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, so you are prepared to resign, effective immediately, and take full responsibility for all the events that transpired at Li'l Sebastian's memorial."
Chris Traeger,But you should put that back.
Chris Traeger,"I believed in you, buddy."
Chris Traeger,It's fantastic.
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,"Ann and I are headed out and I just wanted to thank you for everything today, and I will see you tomorrow."
Chris Traeger,Tom.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry has a wife and three beautiful daughters, a full life, and that's amazing."
Chris Traeger,"April and Andy have Champion, and that's amazing."
Chris Traeger,"You are an intelligent, charismatic, beautiful superhero."
Chris Traeger,"The key to April's heart is within you, Andy."
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Chris Traeger,I believe you are capable of much more.
Chris Traeger,Nonsense.
Chris Traeger,You guys just knocked it completely out of the park.
Chris Traeger,Interesting technique.
Chris Traeger,Look in the mirror.
Chris Traeger,"And I appreciate it, and we will see you later."
Chris Traeger,Now quietly sit behind me and let's join breath.
Chris Traeger,Now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit.
Chris Traeger,"After you, Ron."
Chris Traeger,"But through this door lies a deep, serene quietude."
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Alright.
Chris Traeger,"Uh, you filled the public pools with bottled water?"
Chris Traeger,"Uh, Leslie's put together a presentation for a financial recovery."
Chris Traeger,"Actually, this strip mall has surprisingly decent chi."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,Nice.
Chris Traeger,This is the best meditation center in the area.
Chris Traeger,"I was just out for my night time run, and I thought, ""Why not go visit the Parks Department?"" How's everything going here?"
Chris Traeger,Good!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, we need you back at the command center right now!"
Chris Traeger,"Hey, well--"
Chris Traeger,April's party? April's party?
Chris Traeger,What's great about you?
Chris Traeger,You need to tap in to the aspects of your personality that she once found attractive to make yourself the best version of yourself.
Chris Traeger,We have a class one city emergency.
Chris Traeger,"Although, the smells from the Greek restaurant next door are not ideal."
Chris Traeger,"April and Andy went away for the night, and I looked after Champion here."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, where are my vegan soy patties?"
Chris Traeger,Why don't we just dig in and see what we're up against?
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I'm going to try your ""not trying"" method right here, right now."
Chris Traeger,Not in the slightest.
Chris Traeger,Don't try so hard.
Chris Traeger,"It takes a ton of work for me to get to that kind of a clear head space, no matter how hard I try."
Chris Traeger,Incredible.
Chris Traeger,What were you thinking about?
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've radiated mindfulness."
Chris Traeger,"Impossible to follow, but great advice."
Chris Traeger,Great advice.
Chris Traeger,"As the Germans would say, ""er ist ein wunder hund."
Chris Traeger,"No, it's not even descriptive."
Chris Traeger,But it is descriptive.
Chris Traeger,It's not romantic.
Chris Traeger,"""City manager Chris Traeger was present for this event, and has a personal relationship with the author."""
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Leslie! Shauna just sent me the disclaimer that she's gonna use before she prints the article."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, a word?"
Chris Traeger,""" He is a wonder dog."
Chris Traeger,Are you aware of what's going on out in your department?
Chris Traeger,I would have liked to have seen that show.
Chris Traeger,My nomination was Jerry accidentally forwards his bank statement to everyone.
Chris Traeger,"April, could you come in here a second?"
Chris Traeger,"April, way to come in."
Chris Traeger,Great initiative.
Chris Traeger,"Listen, could you please call Ann Perkins and tell her that I will be unable to enjoy lunch with her today, as I am just swamped."
Chris Traeger,All day.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm feeling so much better."
Chris Traeger,Almost no weird stuff snuck out of my body last night.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I didn't expect you to enjoy it."
Chris Traeger,My one reservation about you as a coworker was that you seem inflexible.
Chris Traeger,"Now, in order to cover up their illicit affair, Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope bribed a city employee."
Chris Traeger,"And merely by agreeing to an activity you're not interested in, you showed flexibility."
Chris Traeger,Are you sure?
Chris Traeger,Is there anything that you didn't eat?
Chris Traeger,"Tom, terrific."
Chris Traeger,It is possibly the best idea anyone has had in this government in 100 years.
Chris Traeger,This is amazing.
Chris Traeger,But II do have one last witness George Williams from Public Works.
Chris Traeger,You're saying that you saw Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope kissing at Li'l Sebastian's memorial?
Chris Traeger,Can you identify Leslie Knope in this chamber?
Chris Traeger,And what happened after this incident?
Chris Traeger,And did you use it?
Chris Traeger,O-M-G.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I read that same article."
Chris Traeger,"""The History of the Ladder."""
Chris Traeger,Maybe there's a catering company in Snerling that we should look into.
Chris Traeger,It's utterly fascinating.
Chris Traeger,"Really? Do you know that the original image of a ladder is in a cave in Valencia, Spain, drawn over 10,000 years ago."
Chris Traeger,""" Put the phone down, take a deep breath, and then you are going to tell Steven that you will be treated with respect, okay?"
Chris Traeger,And thank you for your donation.
Chris Traeger,Ah Ah And go team!
Chris Traeger,Right here.
Chris Traeger,This is amazing.
Chris Traeger,"So, I would like you two to go to Indianapolis and state our case, because you two are my dynamic duo."
Chris Traeger,"The Indiana Little League Baseball Tournament is upon us, and Pawnee hasn't hosted it in 20 years."
Chris Traeger,What is this?
Chris Traeger,I am sending you two on a trip.
Chris Traeger,That's enough.
Chris Traeger,You wanna head back?
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've got the job."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, you're gonna love this."
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, Ron."
Chris Traeger,I did.
Chris Traeger,Think fast.
Chris Traeger,I am taking a probiotic tea break.
Chris Traeger,Why did I have to fall for somebody from the old media?
Chris Traeger,Oh no.
Chris Traeger,I guess I'll have to wait for tomorrow's paper to find out our status.
Chris Traeger,But it would open it up for us to be together.
Chris Traeger,Would you like that?
Chris Traeger,Could you please make sure that my involvement in this stays off the record? I wouldn't want anyone thinking that you're biased because we're something.
Chris Traeger,Don't answer.
Chris Traeger,I wasn't saying that I thought we should get back together again.
Chris Traeger,I have a request.
Chris Traeger,That's really confusing.
Chris Traeger,Just think about it.
Chris Traeger,Ooh.
Chris Traeger,"If Newport wins, the city council may replace me."
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Let's spin.
Chris Traeger,Last one to pick up has still accomplished a great deal.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh!"
Chris Traeger,I'll see you at the river.
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Leslie, this goes without saying, but if you need any speeches or testimonials or just general enthusiasm for your recall fight, I'm your man."
Chris Traeger,"Ben asked for a private meeting with the committee, and he took full responsibility for the bribe and resigned, effective immediately."
Chris Traeger,"And while that is happening, I thought I might share some big news."
Chris Traeger,I am going to ask Millicent Gergich to move in with me.
Chris Traeger,"I I mean, if that's okay with you of course, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,Can you give us a little more information surrounding the deficits that you're running this year?
Chris Traeger,Great.
Chris Traeger,That is an amazing offer.
Chris Traeger,Come on.
Chris Traeger,You know what else I enjoy?
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, amazing."
Chris Traeger,"The dog training course I took was conducted entirely in German, and so now I'm fluent in German Words relating to dogs."
Chris Traeger,"So I say, tell them the truth, and trust that they're gonna respect you for it."
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,You're more Pawnee than anyone I know.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope is literally overflowing with ideas for this town.
Chris Traeger,"And speaking of methane, have you heard about her plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions?"
Chris Traeger,Spin team!
Chris Traeger,And you are from Pawnee.
Chris Traeger,Where you're from That's what makes you who you are.
Chris Traeger,"I just got off the phone with our old boss from Indianapolis, and apparently there may be some sort of a budget problem in Eagleton."
Chris Traeger,He asked if maybe you and I wouldn't have a look.
Chris Traeger,Ann and I make such a great team.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, where you were born is a piece of trivia."
Chris Traeger,You in?
Chris Traeger,Maybe not for long.
Chris Traeger,Hmm.
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but I disagree."
Chris Traeger,It's silly that we're not a team in real life.
Chris Traeger,"I just heard those words come out of my mouth, and I have made a decision."
Chris Traeger,I've heard that you and Tom Haverford are no longer romantically involved.
Chris Traeger,Be an Eagletonian.
Chris Traeger,Is that true?
Chris Traeger,"You have to understand that at the time, I genuinely thought that you and I would never see each other again."
Chris Traeger,Does defy logic.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, I still have feelings for you."
Chris Traeger,Strong feelings.
Chris Traeger,"Emotional, primal feelings."
Chris Traeger,And I would like to give our relationship another try.
Chris Traeger,"Well, that's what makes you so amazing."
Chris Traeger,Auditing bros!
Chris Traeger,There's no job for you.
Chris Traeger,Let me handle this.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,I can be a sort of Conversational lubricant.
Chris Traeger,Absolutely.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes!
Chris Traeger,"I mean, she's not gonna make it."
Chris Traeger,"Look at her, she's dancing around like she's a character in one of those Peanuts cartoons."
Chris Traeger,"Not quite, but I like the energy are we still rolling?"
Chris Traeger,Fight it!
Chris Traeger,Diabetes!
Chris Traeger,Maybe we should find the person who stole his positive attitude.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I love your enthusiasm, but we don't really have the kind of money to launch a massive investigation."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm glad."
Chris Traeger,I'm doing something that you like.
Chris Traeger,Like you.
Chris Traeger,The microchip has been compromised.
Chris Traeger,Now I'm being sarcastic.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,I'm dying.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm sorry that I added five years to your life."
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,Jogging's amazing!
Chris Traeger,My brain is on fire.
Chris Traeger,My body tends to lose a lot of fluids when it's sick.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,You're not supposed to be here.
Chris Traeger,I really do.
Chris Traeger,And I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.
Chris Traeger,"It contains extra virgin olive oil, a little bit of lemon, and hint of turmeric."
Chris Traeger,I think that's a great idea.
Chris Traeger,The most important thing for me and I think for you is that we have a child.
Chris Traeger,I love being a caddy.
Chris Traeger,It's about offering positive reinforcement.
Chris Traeger,There's nothing more important than physical health.
Chris Traeger,"Well, sit down and tell me exactly what has happened."
Chris Traeger,You have extraordinary caput laterale.
Chris Traeger,"I just had no idea, and so now I have to Adjust."
Chris Traeger,"But she is, and you should."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my good gracious."
Chris Traeger,May I see?
Chris Traeger,But I didn't want you to think that I was objectifying you with my male gaze.
Chris Traeger,I was gonna say the exact same thing.
Chris Traeger,Incorrect.
Chris Traeger,That a boy.
Chris Traeger,"It's terrible, and we need to fix it."
Chris Traeger,I'll cancel my four o'clock and my five o'clock and my six o'clock appointments.
Chris Traeger,"But, keep in mind, if you take this job, you must keep your clothes on at all times, even if you get sad."
Chris Traeger,Look at it as a way to feel out whether you want to be a police officer.
Chris Traeger,You want to do that?
Chris Traeger,City Hall needs a new parttime security guard for the weekends.
Chris Traeger,"I had a dream that she came into this room, stole my flu medicine, told me not to tell you, and then disappeared through that hole in the wall."
Chris Traeger,"I think we almost have it, and I am very excited at that prospect."
Chris Traeger,"Way to be, duck."
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Great sweeping.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, while I appreciate your dedication to finding this criminal, I think you might want to take into account what the policeman said."
Chris Traeger,I'd love to hear it.
Chris Traeger,Nice shot!
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,I consider myself a caddy to everyone in my life.
Chris Traeger,It's so much more than just carrying clubs.
Chris Traeger,We should discuss and consider all the possibilities.
Chris Traeger,I promise.
Chris Traeger,"Well, this is the last time."
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,Ben?
Chris Traeger,"Larry, everyone is miserable, and you are only making it worse."
Chris Traeger,There was a big concert.
Chris Traeger,Great plan.
Chris Traeger,Should I keep walking towards you?
Chris Traeger,"Now, there's not."
Chris Traeger,Isn't there anything that we can do about that?
Chris Traeger,That's too bad.
Chris Traeger,"Sorry, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,But I did eat food off of your body.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,It is a genuine pleasure to meet you.
Chris Traeger,Are you eating a paunch burger?
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Chris Traeger,I have to go run 10 miles.
Chris Traeger,I have run 10 miles a day every day for 18 years.
Chris Traeger,"That's 65,000 miles."
Chris Traeger,Professor Linda?
Chris Traeger,A third of the way to the moon.
Chris Traeger,My goal is to run to the moon.
Chris Traeger,"So, let's do 1 more, then 5 more, then 20 in a row."
Chris Traeger,"So, it needs to be perfect."
Chris Traeger,"I mean, you spent a lot of time and energy on writing this."
Chris Traeger,This is important to me because it's important to you.
Chris Traeger,Ann.
Chris Traeger,Why do you ask?
Chris Traeger,Jaguar.
Chris Traeger,Hilarious.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, gang."
Chris Traeger,"Linda, in case you're interested, I brought my own dressing."
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Of course.
Chris Traeger,"April, you seem depressed, and I would know."
Chris Traeger,I spent most of last year being treated by Dr. Richard Nygard for my own emotional problems.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I completely agree."
Chris Traeger,I would love to.
Chris Traeger,Those are the people that have been harassing me.
Chris Traeger,Well
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, out of respect for you, I will meet with your group, but I hope that this puts an end to the madness."
Chris Traeger,It's very important that you replenish my body with electrolytes after every involuntary loss of bodily fluids.
Chris Traeger,"Larry, please."
Chris Traeger,We're having a private conversation.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, are you gonna be joining us?"
Chris Traeger,Listen to me.
Chris Traeger,My body has no fat to protect itself from disease.
Chris Traeger,I think.
Chris Traeger,Ahh!
Chris Traeger,I think City Hall was robbed.
Chris Traeger,I don't think this is part of your police training.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, another computer was reported stolen from the offices on the other side of the courtyard."
Chris Traeger,That is so thoughtful!
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'd like to make Halloween fun for you, like Andy would have, starting right now... With scary, scary monster claws!"
Chris Traeger,So you're saying that I intimidated you?
Chris Traeger,Did what?
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Ann."
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Andy."
Chris Traeger,Yup.
Chris Traeger,Things happen very quickly.
Chris Traeger,But I'd love to try another one.
Chris Traeger,Fat equals splat!
Chris Traeger,Is there something there?
Chris Traeger,"If he hits the ball into the dragon's mouth, he gets Jamm's vote."
Chris Traeger,Ron leads by one.
Chris Traeger,This is it.
Chris Traeger,"The public works department is wonderful, and you are the best idea man in the business."
Chris Traeger,How is that good news?
Chris Traeger,Really?
Chris Traeger,I could literally faint if I didn't have impeccable blood pressure.
Chris Traeger,Sudden death playoff on the very course that hangs in the balance.
Chris Traeger,Men of my age?
Chris Traeger,Absolutely.
Chris Traeger,How old do you think I am?
Chris Traeger,I cannot wait.
Chris Traeger,One second.
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, sir."
Chris Traeger,I think I accidentally got the meat option.
Chris Traeger,"Shauna MalwaeTweep, my exgirlfriend."
Chris Traeger,It seems like you and I have a classic mix 'em up.
Chris Traeger,"This isn't awkward for you, is it?"
Chris Traeger,Definitely.
Chris Traeger,This floor is my friend.
Chris Traeger,Stop pooping.
Chris Traeger,You might want to check that drawer.
Chris Traeger,Wait.
Chris Traeger,"I am 44, and I plan to live to be 150."
Chris Traeger,"I don't remember where, though."
Chris Traeger,I vomited somewhere in this room.
Chris Traeger,It's been an honor working alongside you.
Chris Traeger,Where else on earth would you rather spend your birthday with Leslie?
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, think about it."
Chris Traeger,We're very sorry.
Chris Traeger,I knew that you would be here.
Chris Traeger,"And I was worried that you might be concerned, seeing us together at night."
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, everyone."
Chris Traeger,I hope to see you again.
Chris Traeger,I appreciate your caution.
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but we have a problem."
Chris Traeger,His name is Jeremy Jamm.
Chris Traeger,I understand.
Chris Traeger,You're beautiful.
Chris Traeger,On the inside where your spirit lives.
Chris Traeger,Of course.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, good, I'll text her."
Chris Traeger,But I would love to take you.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's more grueling than fun."
Chris Traeger,It's quite fun.
Chris Traeger,"Before I do, Linda, do you enjoy land kayaking?"
Chris Traeger,I think it's rude not to maintain eye contact with people that I'm talking to.
Chris Traeger,That's from me.
Chris Traeger,I'm teaching a morning Zumba class for retirees.
Chris Traeger,High five.
Chris Traeger,I have to get up early.
Chris Traeger,She's filibustering on roller skates?
Chris Traeger,She's gonna be strapped into those things for hours.
Chris Traeger,"Alright, I better be going."
Chris Traeger,This is literally the most exciting thing that I've ever seen.
Chris Traeger,So.
Chris Traeger,What's the cure?
Chris Traeger,"Dr. Harris, you are literally the meanest person I have ever met."
Chris Traeger,"Yes, it's very hard to drink."
Chris Traeger,"With support like this, Leslie Knope may stand a fighting chance on recall day."
Chris Traeger,Permission to hug you.
Chris Traeger,Li'I Sebastian died?
Chris Traeger,What?
Chris Traeger,"Sir, I formally revoke our hug."
Chris Traeger,On to the next hole.
Chris Traeger,For friendship.
Chris Traeger,"Councilman Jamm leads by eight strokes, and you are both about to set a course record."
Chris Traeger,I have two important pieces of caddy information.
Chris Traeger,"From the top, everybody."
Chris Traeger,That's terrible.
Chris Traeger,It's magic time!
Chris Traeger,You see this color? I don't like it. It's too depressing.
Chris Traeger,The Councilman is away Good luck to you both.
Chris Traeger,I'm feeling it let's go right away!
Chris Traeger,Could you get it?
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope. One second. I'd like some water.
Chris Traeger,"I'd like it to be cold, I'd like it without ice, I'd like it in a glass or a mug with no handle."
Chris Traeger,How can I help you?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,Death is inescapable.
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,They gave us free mylar balloons.
Chris Traeger,But there's something there.
Chris Traeger,That that sucked.
Chris Traeger,No no.
Chris Traeger,It is so inspiring to see Eagletonians putting aside their prejudices.
Chris Traeger,"It is something that we need to figure out, and we should do that right now."
Chris Traeger,Please.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, John, for coming in."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, she's fading."
Chris Traeger,"It's getting late, and Jeremy's eaten all the syrup."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, we need to find a way to smuggle some mineral oil drops onto her tongue."
Chris Traeger,Hey! Happy Birthday.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, look, this is me, okay? You know you can talk to me about anything."
Chris Traeger,You are going to love this. Verosian tea really supercharges the bacteria in your colon.
Chris Traeger,"Plus, it smells interesting."
Chris Traeger,Is Leslie's work unsatisfactory?
Chris Traeger,I don't understand.
Chris Traeger,Waft it.
Chris Traeger,"You want me to do what, now?"
Chris Traeger,You are hilarious.
Chris Traeger,"As in, ""you're dead!"""
Chris Traeger,"Back to Indianapolis briefly, and then, on to a town called Snerling, Indiana, for several months."
Chris Traeger,"Guys, I'm gonna let Julie go home."
Chris Traeger,It's quite small.
Chris Traeger,The cows outnumber the people forty to one.
Chris Traeger,It sounds amazing.
Chris Traeger,"And I thoroughly enjoy you, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,Right here.
Chris Traeger,I'm dying.
Chris Traeger,Tendonitis.
Chris Traeger,Watching you gives me faith that anyone can reinvent themselves.
Chris Traeger,Very impressive.
Chris Traeger,"You're right, you're right."
Chris Traeger,So.
Chris Traeger,What's up with you?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hi, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,It felt much better.
Chris Traeger,"In that last one, I left a nanosecond of a pause between the words, ""together"" and ""we."""
Chris Traeger,Any notes?
Chris Traeger,"Will do, Ron Swanson."
Chris Traeger,"Um, this tear, um, caused by the overwhelming thoughtfulness of my friends will be my baby's first memory."
Chris Traeger,"Well, um Thank you."
Chris Traeger,"Wait a minute, who's G-J-L-G-G?"
Chris Traeger,I like coats.
Chris Traeger,It's right behind you.
Chris Traeger,It's a race between me and the sun.
Chris Traeger,"I call it my ""beat the sun"" run."
Chris Traeger,"Pawnee is, as you all know, the fourth most obese city in America."
Chris Traeger,You caught me before my first run of the day.
Chris Traeger,"No, we are not."
Chris Traeger,We are slimming down.
Chris Traeger,"Guys, what are you doing here? Come in."
Chris Traeger,Starting right here at City Hall.
Chris Traeger,I am implementing a government-wide health initiative.
Chris Traeger,Great idea!
Chris Traeger,Keep 'em coming.
Chris Traeger,"Now, if anybody would like to join me, I will be running backwards up the big hill behind the Walmart."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Chris Traeger,My body's a microchip.
Chris Traeger,To the future.
Chris Traeger,And just the fact that you feel bad about your bag of nothing proves that.
Chris Traeger,Because we're always gonna be friends.
Chris Traeger,"My buddy boxes are about the past, but let's focus on the future."
Chris Traeger,Would I be providing this sample today?
Chris Traeger,"Guys, I don't need anything from you."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, those hamburgers are gone."
Chris Traeger,Indeed it has.
Chris Traeger,"Red meat can cause sluggishness, heart disease, even impotence."
Chris Traeger,April Ludgate.
Chris Traeger,But it had that trademark Ben Wyatt mix of thoughtful and resourceful.
Chris Traeger,I guess it's go time.
Chris Traeger,Sounds romantic.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, well, I'm going to keep trying, because you are incredible."
Chris Traeger,"Historically yes, exclusively."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, Ann Perkins, my fallopian princess."
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins, my excellent employee."
Chris Traeger,You always like tall brunettes.
Chris Traeger,Well she was a tall brunette.
Chris Traeger,It was worth a shot.
Chris Traeger,How did your date with Cindy go?
Chris Traeger,"Well, I hope that whoever you end up with treats like you like the amazing person that you are."
Chris Traeger,Come in here.
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Chris Traeger,"I am so glad that this got resolved, because I hate being angry."
Chris Traeger,I'm surrounded by friends Friends I don't know yet.
Chris Traeger,"You are, without a doubt, the queen of toilet humor."
Chris Traeger,I'm not.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,Where do you live?
Chris Traeger,And I am going to go run some stairs and work through these feelings.
Chris Traeger,Maybe all of my emotions tumbling out like this means that I can get a clean start.
Chris Traeger,Maybe you're right.
Chris Traeger,Right.
Chris Traeger,I just wanna say that getting to know you and watching you work has been one of the greatest experiences of my life-- that and working with Dr. Richard Nygard.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,I can't believe that I spent the entire party in a room being happy sad on a night that means so much to my two best friends.
Chris Traeger,You are literally the best friend that I will ever have.
Chris Traeger,It was your idea to get me that box.
Chris Traeger,Ask not what your country can do for you.
Chris Traeger,"Guys, look what I got at the president's day booth."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, that is a very creative idea."
Chris Traeger,Some assorted items.
Chris Traeger,Let's see what's in here.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
Chris Traeger,It's evening me out.
Chris Traeger,This is weirdly working.
Chris Traeger,"In terms of shirts, I can wear white"
Chris Traeger,I'm very excited about this.
Chris Traeger,I just got caught up in my own thoughts.
Chris Traeger,Those are the spice girls.
Chris Traeger,"And we're getting to the bottom of what's going on with me and Jerry's daughter, and I thought you would be a tremendous addition to this think tank."
Chris Traeger,Baby?
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, April."
Chris Traeger,Happy Halloween.
Chris Traeger,This one's not as good.
Chris Traeger,"And if you want to egg Larry's house, come find me."
Chris Traeger,Posh?
Chris Traeger,Scary?
Chris Traeger,"That's a funny joke, April."
Chris Traeger,"But the truth is, I'm very much in love with Ann."
Chris Traeger,"Wow, that's amazing."
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,Precisely.
Chris Traeger,A turkey burger.
Chris Traeger,Sporty?
Chris Traeger,Semiformal?
Chris Traeger,"You take lean, ground turkey meat, you make that into a burger instead of red meat."
Chris Traeger,Do you understand me madam?
Chris Traeger,And some pieces of paper.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, I get that a lot."
Chris Traeger,So my childhood illness there's no chance I would pass that on?
Chris Traeger,I have to get out of here.
Chris Traeger,Completely off topic.
Chris Traeger,"But we don't want to sell any of our major assets, because we don't want to lose out on any future revenue streams."
Chris Traeger,"All right, let's go."
Chris Traeger,All these kids have fathers and mothers who have birthed them and are guiding them through life.
Chris Traeger,I am 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I'm going to do.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins asked me if I would like to donate sperm, so she can have a baby."
Chris Traeger,It's a battle between my primal desire to bring a child into this world and my paralyzing fear of negatively affecting any living thing.
Chris Traeger,Why don't we go back to my place and I'll fire up the grill?
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,No!
Chris Traeger,"What do you say, Ron?"
Chris Traeger,"Donna, are you grabbing my butt?"
Chris Traeger,"Also, I'm proud of you."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no."
Chris Traeger,That is remarkably close to what I was going to say.
Chris Traeger,You ever tried a turkey burger?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, I know."
Chris Traeger,"Go back to my place, I'll make you some grub?"
Chris Traeger,"Donna, you are a remarkable woman, and I just wanted to say that I've always thought of you as family."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, that is literally the greatest idea in human history."
Chris Traeger,One other question.
Chris Traeger,It'll be just as good as it would've been here.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,None.
Chris Traeger,A grain of sand could destroy it.
Chris Traeger,My body is like a microchip.
Chris Traeger,I have 2.8% body fat.
Chris Traeger,This today?
Chris Traeger,April--
Chris Traeger,and you deserve someone amazing and smart and beautiful.
Chris Traeger,I go in alone with this pornographic disc and do it myself.
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,"They are working on a number of fascinating, big budget projects"
Chris Traeger,"I have a meeting at public works, and I was thinking that maybe you might wanna sit in."
Chris Traeger,I will try again soon.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we were."
Chris Traeger,And it's also weird because we dated and we remember what it's like to engage in some of those physical activities.
Chris Traeger,Let me remove my clothes so we may begin to engage in physical activity to multiply our genes.
Chris Traeger,But sad.
Chris Traeger,But happy.
Chris Traeger,"If that happens to me, I'd be miserable."
Chris Traeger,"It says here that some men gain ""sympathy weight"" when their partners get pregnant."
Chris Traeger,These pamphlets are fascinating.
Chris Traeger,How are you?
Chris Traeger,There is nothing more disgusting than an invasion of privacy.
Chris Traeger,And I should know.
Chris Traeger,I've had many women steal my undershirts.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,I was in charge of the cake.
Chris Traeger,"To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf."
Chris Traeger,"You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach, and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction."
Chris Traeger,I am scaring you!
Chris Traeger,What about this?
Chris Traeger,"I'm Bert Macklin, friendly lifeguard."
Chris Traeger,Really?
Chris Traeger,That's even harder to believe.
Chris Traeger,I understand.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,That I am being forced to brutally cut entirely.
Chris Traeger,Wonderful.
Chris Traeger,No problem.
Chris Traeger,"As you know, I'm not a big fan of delivering bad news."
Chris Traeger,Have you thought about a concession speech?
Chris Traeger,What do you think?
Chris Traeger,"And together, we can make a difference."
Chris Traeger,"""Eat my shorts, Jabronies."""
Chris Traeger,"""Knope, out."""
Chris Traeger,Make a change.
Chris Traeger,Make a choice.
Chris Traeger,But it can be prevented.
Chris Traeger,Sounds like fun.
Chris Traeger,Sure.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes can't be cured.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,"I've failed you, both as a scary monster and a friend."
Chris Traeger,What happened to us?
Chris Traeger,"I was just doing my daily lunch time 10 miles and I ran by the hospital, and I thought I'd pop up and say hi."
Chris Traeger,"No, I'm already at mile nine."
Chris Traeger,We need to stop dealing in hypotheticals.
Chris Traeger,I know.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,I have a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute.
Chris Traeger,The scientist who studied me said that my heart could pump jet fuel up into an airplane.
Chris Traeger,I'd love to go out on a date with you.
Chris Traeger,I think you might find me attractive because you got drunk and kissed me when we first met.
Chris Traeger,"And no pressure, but I do have tonight open."
Chris Traeger,We need to find those.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, well, then, we should definitely go look for those."
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we were."
Chris Traeger,"Ann, we dated."
Chris Traeger,I am just filled to the brim with questions.
Chris Traeger,"Ron filled me in on everything that happened, and I really wish that the ethics investigation hadn't interfered with your campaign in any way."
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, now, for your Christmas present."
Chris Traeger,Uh-oh.
Chris Traeger,It's kind of a sad story.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, she drowned immediately."
Chris Traeger,Do I keep this?
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,The entranceway to your house sends a message to the world about who you are.
Chris Traeger,"Excellent idea, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,And the front door provides energy flow and opportunity.
Chris Traeger,You cannot limit that.
Chris Traeger,It's the true story of a woman born with no arms and no legs who attempted to swim the English Channel.
Chris Traeger,And I'm engrossed in this book.
Chris Traeger,"Ann, so glad I found you."
Chris Traeger,Can I talk to you for a minute.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we do have very important pamphlet reading to do."
Chris Traeger,"I need to ask you a question, and if you're uncomfortable answering it right now, you can take some time and think about it."
Chris Traeger,That would be okay.
Chris Traeger,This is so weird.
Chris Traeger,Should I think about you?
Chris Traeger,Is tendonitis symptomatic of something larger?
Chris Traeger,Interesting right.
Chris Traeger,"I'm just very worried, I'm not sure this doctor's been properly trained."
Chris Traeger,Her brother died climbing Everest.
Chris Traeger,And I try not to think about you waiting out here trying not to think about me.
Chris Traeger,"Of course, I'm sorry."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, what about Shelly from the health food store."
Chris Traeger,And you stay out here and try not to think about what I'm doing in there.
Chris Traeger,I do hope we can be friends before I die.
Chris Traeger,"Come on in, come on in."
Chris Traeger,This is gonna be great.
Chris Traeger,I am so glad you guys called.
Chris Traeger,Welcome.
Chris Traeger,Your suspension's been lifted.
Chris Traeger,"Here's one to me, and it just says ""Thanks."""
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,"Please, come back to work."
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, I see you behind that attractive purse."
Chris Traeger,You haven't returned any of my calls.
Chris Traeger,I am touched and honored that you would even consider me to be the father of your child.
Chris Traeger,And I'm glad that you came right out and said it.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, if we're really considering this, then we have to start at a place of complete honesty."
Chris Traeger,"Tom, am I to understand correctly that you are now romantically involved with Ann Perkins?"
Chris Traeger,Great.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I thought that we could just talk before you left town if that's okay."
Chris Traeger,So I just went with it.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, that's nice of you to say."
Chris Traeger,But the sensations were amazing.
Chris Traeger,Can I have just a little bit of time to think about it?
Chris Traeger,Jen Barkley.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm off."
Chris Traeger,Unfun fact: My Uncle just had a stroke.
Chris Traeger,Regular fact: I have to go to a meeting.
Chris Traeger,"Well, fun fact: Ben just got an amazing accounting job."
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,What the voters saw tonight is an undeniable fact.
Chris Traeger,"That one of these candidates is right for this town, and one of them is not."
Chris Traeger,"Bye, friend."
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, guys."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,There were moments that I didn't fully understand some of the physical shapes that we were making Mm.
Chris Traeger,Why are you using this wood?
Chris Traeger,"Well, like my therapist says, ""You can't share too much or too often."""
Chris Traeger,"I'm both confused, and if we're being totally honest, a little aroused."
Chris Traeger,I think we had a deep emotional connection that is very worth exploring.
Chris Traeger,"""Message to the recall haters: You can't keep Leslie Knope down."""
Chris Traeger,"""She's too real for this ish."""
Chris Traeger,"""hashtag boss bitch."""
Chris Traeger,So I'm gonna ask her out again When she's emotionally ready.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Ron Great red shirt."
Chris Traeger,"No, no, I'm gonna go for a light 15k."
Chris Traeger,And I should probably thank you for introducing me to Linda.
Chris Traeger,I missed yesterday.
Chris Traeger,"Way to go, buddy."
Chris Traeger,"And, very graphic."
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, you're number three."
Chris Traeger,"Well, that's very perceptive, Ron."
Chris Traeger,What do you say I take you to lunch and then we can talk about all the projects that you want to get accomplished.
Chris Traeger,Way to go.
Chris Traeger,"It appears, whereas ""bitch boss"" is clearly an indication of her frustration, ""boss bitch"" is a term of endearment."
Chris Traeger,What a pill.
Chris Traeger,Great.
Chris Traeger,For the loose ends.
Chris Traeger,"Good, so I'll make the call then, to get the extension?"
Chris Traeger,Parks and Health work closely together on outdoor programs and exercise initiatives.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,I like thinking.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins?
Chris Traeger,What's up? I got a call from the boys upstairs.
Chris Traeger,Complete one major project.
Chris Traeger,And racquetball.
Chris Traeger,I would like to eat at the game I'd like popcorn and candy and the home team at the game!
Chris Traeger,And they have a new assignment for us.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,"I spent the last hour reading some of Donna's old tweets, and it turns out there are some more things that she said about you."
Chris Traeger,And I feel like we should ask for an extension to stay here.
Chris Traeger,"Guard your buds, 'cause they're about to get nipped!"
Chris Traeger,No sullying allowed!
Chris Traeger,Not on her watch.
Chris Traeger,"I understand your point, but there's no way that I can just roll over on this."
Chris Traeger,Isn't language fun?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I want you to help us choose a replacement."
Chris Traeger,With the public works department about the dam.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I loved your book."
Chris Traeger,You have only seven.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, this is a very important moment for you."
Chris Traeger,How we deal with tragedy defines who we are.
Chris Traeger,I used to be terrible at it.
Chris Traeger,Beyond terrible.
Chris Traeger,Take a look at this.
Chris Traeger,"In a town of this size, the Parks department traditionally has ten employees."
Chris Traeger,Diabetes!
Chris Traeger,You are not going to let this deflate you.
Chris Traeger,Delivery guy.
Chris Traeger,"Which means that everything we shot so far is unusable, but let's use this as an opportunity to revisit the script."
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, I hate to say this, but I have a stain on my shirt."
Chris Traeger,"Whoever it is, it's quite serious."
Chris Traeger,"Dated may 1st, 2010."
Chris Traeger,"A tweet has been tweeted from the Parks and Rec Twitter, and I'm afraid it is quite sexually graphic."
Chris Traeger,Fair enough.
Chris Traeger,"You are going to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and we will figure out what the next step is."
Chris Traeger,How's it going in here?
Chris Traeger,"Donna, there is trouble a-brewin'."
Chris Traeger,"And together, we can make a difference."
Chris Traeger,"I'm so happy that those eight weeks turned into three years, and that you met Leslie, and that we both found a home."
Chris Traeger,Then there's a picture of a pair of lips and then a picture of an eggplant.
Chris Traeger,I want to thank you for being so ruthless and cruel in the meeting the other day.
Chris Traeger,It's like racquetball for your mouth!
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,There's that shirt.
Chris Traeger,I see.
Chris Traeger,"Well, thank you for being forthright and telling me."
Chris Traeger,We were supposed to be here eight weeks.
Chris Traeger,You really are an amazing human being.
Chris Traeger,"You're a good man, Ron."
Chris Traeger,"I want to thank you for this opportunity and your patience, and your intelligence, and your insight."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Ann, I I know that I can be intense, but I'm only trying to be the best me that I can be."
Chris Traeger,I'm quite lonely.
Chris Traeger,Do you think we got it?
Chris Traeger,I think we got it.
Chris Traeger,That's it.
Chris Traeger,"It's okay, buddy, let it out."
Chris Traeger,Take me out to the ball game take me out to the game I just want to be at the game
Chris Traeger,"""Mayor of Whoreville."""
Chris Traeger,"""Reelect Jan Cooper."""
Chris Traeger,I'd love to.
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,And she's already scaled back her time.
Chris Traeger,This is literally the best nonfat eggnog I've ever had.
Chris Traeger,"No, but it will add exactly 440 calories."
Chris Traeger,But you know what?
Chris Traeger,I'm fine.
Chris Traeger,She's the Chancellor of Germany.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, this could go on for some time."
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,I'm going to run admissions at Indiana.
Chris Traeger,it'll be just like old times in Indianapolis.
Chris Traeger,We're back.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, my woodworking project, it's for displaying shoes!"
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,You only live once.
Chris Traeger,A cucumber.
Chris Traeger,The department is so small because Leslie Knope singlehandedly does the work of four people.
Chris Traeger,"Richard Nygard, who I see 15 times a week."
Chris Traeger,Great.
Chris Traeger,How are you?
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,I'm trading Wolverines for Hoosiers.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, guys, I just wanted to come by and thank you for a phenomenal evening."
Chris Traeger,I'm thinking something raw and cucumber based.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, it's Chris."
Chris Traeger,Why is that?
Chris Traeger,"Well, I am now."
Chris Traeger,I do that literally 50 times a day.
Chris Traeger,"This time, the giant spider got caught in my web."
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,I recently compared her to a nutrient-rich chia seed.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you are the master of the metaphor."
Chris Traeger,Progress.
Chris Traeger,"Well, we both are in serious relationships."
Chris Traeger,"You have Leslie and I have my therapist, Dr."
Chris Traeger,"I don't know if you know this, but things with fat in them taste way better than things with no fat."
Chris Traeger,We need to find a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Chris Traeger,Dennis Cooper was fired today.
Chris Traeger,"Short answer, he went bananas."
Chris Traeger,Has there been any resistance from the community?
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Arbor, Michigan, is literally the greatest city that I have ever lived in."
Chris Traeger,"Now how big is the park, exactly?"
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,I think maybe you could learn somethg from him.
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,He has been in this department a long time.
Chris Traeger,"I think that you ask a lot of the people that you work with, and I think that people do what you ask because they love you."
Chris Traeger,"But, I also think that driving people as hard as you do can ruffle some feathers."
Chris Traeger,I think a lot of things.
Chris Traeger,"""Jan, I love you."""
Chris Traeger,"""Please come back."""
Chris Traeger,"""I realize that I'm not blameless here."""
Chris Traeger,We should order.
Chris Traeger,"""Please."""
Chris Traeger,Brought to you by the Health Department.
Chris Traeger,"""Miss Chlamydia."""
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, we have an issue."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie Knope works tirelessly every day, so our parks can be the best they can be."
Chris Traeger,He is just determined.
Chris Traeger,Good.
Chris Traeger,"If she wins, she'll be dividing her time between Parks and City Council."
Chris Traeger,I'm going to have to hire a deputy director to pick up the slack.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, buddy."
Chris Traeger,Then prove it.
Chris Traeger,What are you gonna have?
Chris Traeger,And then we can talk shop.
Chris Traeger,Great job team.
Chris Traeger,"You two, when you work on a project together, are simply amazing."
Chris Traeger,"Long answer, his wife, Jan, had an affair, gave him a venereal disease, and so he put signs about her all through City Hall."
Chris Traeger,I'm sure you've seen them.
Chris Traeger,"""Jan Cooper will give you Chlamydia."""
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I am sorry, but I could not postpone these pointless hearings that Jamm is having."
Chris Traeger,"""Brought to you by the Pawnee Health Department."
Chris Traeger,"""Chlamydia affects nearly 100% of Jan Coopers."""
Chris Traeger,"""The Department of Health congratulates Jan Cooper."""
Chris Traeger,"So, we're moving back."
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, essentially I'd like you to choose a new font. Jerry, I am making you my number two guy on the new font project."
Chris Traeger,I just finished making an entry in my dream journal.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,"I can read over 3,000 words a minute with total comprehension."
Chris Traeger,Will you look at that?
Chris Traeger,"One time, I read all of Siddhartha at a traffic stop."
Chris Traeger,And it went terrific.
Chris Traeger,"Rethink our visual brand, take these words, and make something amazing."
Chris Traeger,She's at home.
Chris Traeger,It's so good to see you.
Chris Traeger,Gayle?
Chris Traeger,"Relax, gloomy goose."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, come meet Jerry's wife."
Chris Traeger,Terrible.
Chris Traeger,"Ultimately, we learn the most about ourselves through the losses."
Chris Traeger,"Even better loss, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,And perfect.
Chris Traeger,"Excellent win, Ron."
Chris Traeger,Hole in one!
Chris Traeger,I promised myself I was not going to cry tonight.
Chris Traeger,"And, as you know, Millicent and I went out last night."
Chris Traeger,They'll adjust.
Chris Traeger,Give them time.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, sir!"
Chris Traeger,Oh.
Chris Traeger,But I think I can redefine your flow in a very positive way.
Chris Traeger,"Great, let's do it."
Chris Traeger,Great idea!
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, it's quite terrible."
Chris Traeger,Girl from The Ring.
Chris Traeger,"Again, the date was amazing, we had sparkling conversation, and, full disclosure, she did spend the night at my house."
Chris Traeger,"Gayle, I hope you're not in any way uncomfortable that I'm here, since I dated your daughter."
Chris Traeger,"Have a great day, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,I'm a speed reader.
Chris Traeger,You are UFC legend Chuck Liddell.
Chris Traeger,Andy!
Chris Traeger,I solved that mystery before you did.
Chris Traeger,Sherlock Holmes.
Chris Traeger,And a super gift.
Chris Traeger,"I think what's important is we all had a goal, and we achieved it."
Chris Traeger,I have someone I'd like you to meet.
Chris Traeger,You are a policewoman.
Chris Traeger,"To me, Sherlock Holmes is literally the greatest character in the Western canon."
Chris Traeger,Blue shirt Badge Nightstick.
Chris Traeger,"Smart, intuitive, handsome."
Chris Traeger,"Replace his pasty British frailty with superhuman physical fitness, and you get Sherlock Traeger."
Chris Traeger,Donna?
Chris Traeger,Mister Potato head.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,I'll run to my next meeting.
Chris Traeger,The energy in this house is a little stale.
Chris Traeger,I read it cover to cover.
Chris Traeger,Another in a long line of lessons from the great Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,"Richard Nygard, suggested that I try some non exercise based hobbies."
Chris Traeger,Tom!
Chris Traeger,"My therapist, Dr."
Chris Traeger,I'm just going to come right out and say it.
Chris Traeger,"And if so, why?"
Chris Traeger,Is one better?
Chris Traeger,Are they copper or brass?
Chris Traeger,I made this.
Chris Traeger,It is the letter from the statehouse Telling us that we have been assigned to Pawnee.
Chris Traeger,"Now, wait a minute."
Chris Traeger,I have something for you.
Chris Traeger,What are these metal latches?
Chris Traeger,"Who knew that watercress, garbanzo beans and walnuts could complement each other so well?"
Chris Traeger,I want to define your bagua.
Chris Traeger,And I have already broken that promise five times.
Chris Traeger,"""I never do."""
Chris Traeger,Is it more pliable?
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,Question for you.
Chris Traeger,I would like you to redesign our Parks department logo.
Chris Traeger,But Pawnee is better.
Chris Traeger,"Congratulations, Mr."
Chris Traeger,Assistant City Manager.
Chris Traeger,It's a feng shui term.
Chris Traeger,"Before I started, it was bigger."
Chris Traeger,Really? Why?
Chris Traeger,But I will not break it a sixth.
Chris Traeger,So I've been studying woodworking with Ron.
Christine Porter,I want to respectfully say that I'm in favor of the fence.
Christine Porter,I see it as a kind of punishment for Pawnee that might inspire your town to clean up its act.
Christine Porter,Hello.
Christine Porter,I'm Christine Porter.
Cindy,"Bye, Mark."
Clarence Carrington,Anybody got any water?
Clarence Carrington,I actually taught Homemaking.

Clarence Carrington,No.
Clarence Carrington,That first year we offered four classes.
Clarence Carrington,You really shouldn't be leading us.
Clarence Carrington,Uh-oh.
Clarence Carrington,"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea."
Clarence Carrington,"I don't need your help, jailbird."
Clarence Carrington,"Women need a lot of blood to flow through to their baby centers, which leaves less to the brain, you see."
Clarence Carrington,"I'd stay away from leadership roles, for your own safety."
Clarence Carrington,"If you're menstruating, you'll attract bears."

Councilman Dexhart,"Oh, who knows?"
Councilman Dexhart,"I got so many kids from different women, I just get all of their birthdays out of the way one day a year."
Councilman Dexhart,Should we?
Councilman Dexhart,I don't want you to apologize.
Councilman Dexhart,Mmmhmm.
Councilman Dexhart,"Joan, this whole Pawnee Sun story is ""gotcha journalism"" at its worst."
Councilman Dexhart,People already think we did it.
Councilman Dexhart,Thank you for meeting me.
Councilman Dexhart,You've got nothing to lose.
Councilman Dexhart,I'm very good.
Councilman Dexhart,I want to know who told you.
Councilman Dexhart,Ladies.
Councilman Dexhart,"Honey, let's just keep our private life in the bedroom where it belongs."
Councilman Dexhart,Fluoride can control minds?
Councilman Dexhart,Who told you?
Councilman Dexhart,"All I can say is I wasn't just having sex, I was making love to a beautiful woman and her boyfriend, and a third person, whose name I never learned."
Councilman Dexhart,"And to my wife, I apologize."
Councilman Dexhart,I totally did all of it.
Councilman Dexhart,"All right, stop playing dumb."
Councilman Dexhart,I am here to set the record straight.
Councilman Dexhart,Or them.
Councilman Dexhart,You know damn well what happened.
Councilman Dexhart,"Furthermore, it was wrong of me to say I was building houses for the underprivileged, when I was actually having four way sex in a cave in Brazil."
Councilman Dexhart,"I got the babysitter pregnant, then when she was in the delivery room, I had sex with not one, but four nurses in a supply closet, as well as a woman whose husband was getting a liver transplant."
Councilman Dexhart,"Recently, certain allegations have come to light about my inappropriate conduct."
Councilman Dexhart,"Now, which one of them told you?"
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the liver lady?
Councilman Dexhart,"They were still extremely graphic, and appreciated by all of us."
Councilman Dexhart,Oh!
Councilman Dexhart,"I had never heard of several of those terms, and I'm a freak."
Councilman Dexhart,Okay.
Councilman Dexhart,Mmm.
Councilman Dexhart,"Based on that skit, I know you heard about the new scandal that's about to break."
Councilman Dexhart,It could be a bunch of hot ladies.
Councilman Dexhart,"Ms. Meagle, let me first say that I am a big fan of your writing."
Councilman Dexhart,"Like, you can use it to make ladies do stuff?"
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the babysitter?
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the nurse who delivered our love child?
Councilman Dexhart,"and ""Anthony Weiner."""
Councilman Dexhart,You look great.
Councilman Dexhart,She was talking dirty to me.
Councilman Dexhart,"But before I go, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask."
Councilman Dexhart,"In my defense, it was my birthday and I really wanted to do it."
Councilman Dexhart,Really good stuff.
Councilman Dexhart,It's good stuff.
Councilman Dexhart,"I sent these texts to roughly 100 women, under the following pseudonyms"" ""Enrique Shockwave,"" ""Willie Dynamite,"" ""Lee Harvey Teabag."""
Councilman Dexhart,It gets me off when women tell me that.
Councilman Dexhart,"No, really, tell me."
Councilman Dexhart,You tell me.
Councilman Dexhart,"Does this make me a ""bad boy""?"
Councilman Dexhart,"I also engaged in inappropriate texting, ""sexting,"" and ""Tex-Mexting,"" which is where you send photos of your junk from the restroom of a Chili's To Go."
Councilman Dexhart,"Hi, sweetie."
Councilman Dexhart,I'm expected at two different maternity wards.
Councilman Dexhart,"Take it from me, denying only makes things worse."
Councilman Dexhart,"Well, in that case, everything I just told you was just a funny prank."

Councilman Dexhart,Yes.
Councilman Dexhart,That's right.
Councilman Dexhart,"Mmm, no, thanks."
Councilman Dexhart,"Morning, Leslie."
Councilman Dexhart,She has a mole on her right buttock.
Councilman Dexhart,I can prove it.
Councilman Dexhart,"To be honest, being linked to Leslie is a lot less damning than the real story."
Councilman Dexhart,Second.
Councilman Dexhart,I love Lutherans.
Councilman Dexhart,"What are you, Lutheran?"
Councilman Dexhart,It won't do you any good.
Councilman Dexhart,You're like a glass of whole milk.
Councilman Houser,I'd put a pin in this for now.
Councilman Houser,The council vote is three to two in favor of another term for you.
Councilman Houser,"Sorry, Chris."
Councilman Houser,He's not exactly thrilled you've been volunteering for the Knope campaign in your spare time.
Councilman Houser,"If Bobby Newport wins, he's gonna try to bring in his own guy."
Councilman Houser,If Newport wins You're gone.

Councilman Howser,I have been busy.
Councilman Howser,"Next order of business: It's agenda item 280B, a motion to construct a dog park on municipal lot 48."

Dave Sanderson,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,"I mean, I need to know soon."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you kind of do."
Dave Sanderson,You don't have to answer right away.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, I don't know, it's kind of a weird question."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Dave Sanderson,That's affirmative.
Dave Sanderson,"Yeah, I'm definitely in love with Leslie."
Dave Sanderson,"Yeah, that makes a lot more sense."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, yeah."
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, Leslie?"
Dave Sanderson,"So, yeah, I guess I'm in love with the Army."
Dave Sanderson,"I know this seems kind of fast, but I feel like we got something here."
Dave Sanderson,I believe you.
Dave Sanderson,"Didn't, like, 30 people die in that fire?"
Dave Sanderson,"When you get all feisty like that, it gets my heart racing."
Dave Sanderson,"So, that would make tonight our second."
Dave Sanderson,Last night was our first date.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, yeah."
Dave Sanderson,You can make it up to me tonight on our second date.
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Purse, and earrings, and a shoe."
Dave Sanderson,You left quite a bit of stuff at my place last night.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, yeah."
Dave Sanderson,Yes.
Dave Sanderson,That's right.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Okay?
Dave Sanderson,"Let's, Let's go."
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Look, maybe I ought to give you a lift home."
Dave Sanderson,Yes.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, he's got a couple of 359s on him."
Dave Sanderson,Public urination.
Dave Sanderson,He's probably gonna go anger pee in the courtyard.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you crazy park people, I'm out of here."
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie, I'll see you tomorrow."
Dave Sanderson,Roger that.
Dave Sanderson,I'm looking forward to it.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, did I say something to make you worry about--"
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, I think that's a sweater shirt combo."
Dave Sanderson,I'm right here.
Dave Sanderson,"You know I'm here, right?"
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,I don't knowâ¦
Dave Sanderson,8 o' clock?
Dave Sanderson,You like dancing?
Dave Sanderson,"I don't, I'm a, I don't like dancing."
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, so, not-- That's not your grandma, then."
Dave Sanderson,All right.
Dave Sanderson,I got it.
Dave Sanderson,How's that schedule looking?
Dave Sanderson,Just lock it in later?
Dave Sanderson,Talk later about it?
Dave Sanderson,"Cause I usually just call mine ""Nana."""
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,There's a lot of ways we could handle that.
Dave Sanderson,"You may want to come visit me, right? There's a 75 dollar change fee, but I could pay you that, or I could reimburse you."
Dave Sanderson,You know what? Keep it.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,"I guess I just thought with everything that happened, you'd want a fresh start."
Dave Sanderson,"Like I'm on a Stairmaster, except more, like, in a sexual... Context."
Dave Sanderson,Ladies.
Dave Sanderson,I thought you did great.
Dave Sanderson,That's her name?
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,You're awake.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,I just came by to see the murals.
Dave Sanderson,This one's pretty amazing.
Dave Sanderson,Is that your grandma?
Dave Sanderson,She's got him by the hair pretty good there.
Dave Sanderson,It's a little intimidating.
Dave Sanderson,"To tell you the truth, I didn't come here to look at the murals."
Dave Sanderson,I came to ask her on a date.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, Leslie, I really like you."
Dave Sanderson,"And I was wondering if maybe you'd want to get a cup of coffee or something, sometime."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie's really cool, and she's smart."
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, listen, your scare tactics clearly worked."
Dave Sanderson,"No, babe."
Dave Sanderson,"Ma'am, ma'am, as I've told you several times already, this is a police matter."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date."
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.
Dave Sanderson,I think it's kind of cute.
Dave Sanderson,I like Miss Knope.
Dave Sanderson,I liked her.
Dave Sanderson,"I got to say, I--"
Dave Sanderson,Step out of the van.
Dave Sanderson,"When I first met her I didn't care much for her, because like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable."
Dave Sanderson,Miss Knope was attractive to me.
Dave Sanderson,"As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor."
Dave Sanderson,I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Can we not I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,"No, there's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID."
Dave Sanderson,I need you to step out and show me some ID.
Dave Sanderson,I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
Dave Sanderson,"How you doing tonight, sir?"
Dave Sanderson,I'm at the vehicle now.
Dave Sanderson,641 to base.
Dave Sanderson,"He's going to do probation, he's a minor."
Dave Sanderson,Look.
Dave Sanderson,There's not gonna be a jury--
Dave Sanderson,He's a minor.
Dave Sanderson,I'm very close right now to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
Dave Sanderson,"He's not gonna go to jail, you know."
Dave Sanderson,I get it.
Dave Sanderson,Got it.
Dave Sanderson,It's no problem.
Dave Sanderson,You can keep it.
Dave Sanderson,"Actually, no."
Dave Sanderson,I need that for my uniform.
Dave Sanderson,"We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy."
Dave Sanderson,"Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date."
Dave Sanderson,We searched the van and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Dave Sanderson,"No, I'm being serious."
Dave Sanderson,But I can give you a ride back to your car.
Dave Sanderson,"Look, Ms. Knope, it wasn't just his behavior, okay? I think your friend might be some kind of a pervert."
Dave Sanderson,I can't give it to you.
Dave Sanderson,Parks and Recreation?
Dave Sanderson,Nice job with that.
Dave Sanderson,What branch of government are you in?
Dave Sanderson,"My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on it 50- 50."
Dave Sanderson,Do you understand?
Dave Sanderson,"So, where's that marijuana at?"
Dave Sanderson,"And you got to believe me, he didn't give me a choice."
Dave Sanderson,"Your friend, he acted like an ass."
Dave Sanderson,These are carrots.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, come with me, please."
Dave Sanderson,"Is that the house there, where your best friend lives? Where she saw the van from?"
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Now, could you please go home, and get some sleep, and let this matter be resolved."
Dave Sanderson,"And thankfully, that's not what happened."
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,What?
Dave Sanderson,Hey!
Dave Sanderson,But let's--
Dave Sanderson,"Well, it ain't Jerry."
Dave Sanderson,"Now, son, I'm a police officer."
Dave Sanderson,It won't.
Dave Sanderson,Okay?
Dave Sanderson,You shouldn't lie to me.
Dave Sanderson,Because you've had runins with Miss Knope in the past.
Dave Sanderson,We can't.
Dave Sanderson,I don't think he did it.
Dave Sanderson,"We can talk to him for maybe an hour, and then I gotta let him go."
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, this isn't strictly legal."
Dave Sanderson,We don't know that.
Dave Sanderson,"No, nope."
Dave Sanderson,We don't.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, we were trying to question him about this vandalism."
Dave Sanderson,On what charge?
Dave Sanderson,We don't have a lab.
Dave Sanderson,That doesn't mean anything to me.
Dave Sanderson,Mmmhmm?
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Look, I'm not gonna torture this kid."
Dave Sanderson,"I would be frightened to live in a town that she's the cop of, frankly."
Dave Sanderson,I don't think she would make a good cop.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,I gotta go tell my boss why I illegally detained a teenager.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Just a second.
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, my God."
Dave Sanderson,Don't touch that.
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie, I don't know what to tell you."
Dave Sanderson,Looks like it's open.
Dave Sanderson,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,We've been tailing that kid for a couple of hours.
Dave Sanderson,"I mean, it must have been somebody else."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Dave Sanderson,I shouldn't have gotten involved with this.
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Dave Sanderson,It's just... It's just bad police work.
David Moser,"I thought you were dead, Clarence."
David Moser,How long is this gonna take?
David Moser,"I'm so old, I need to drink water."
David Moser,"Well, I was in Public Works for eight years."
David Moser,"Screw you, you old coot."
David Moser,But the director was pretty young.
David Moser,What?
David Moser,"So, I put in for a transfer, swooped in and pushed him out."
David Moser,"I mean, who gives a crap about this crap."
David Moser,No.
David Moser,I used to just copy the Eagleton one.
David Moser,I want water.
David Moser,You should just copy the Eagleton one.
David Moser,Just the money and the pension.
David Moser,Yes!
David Moser,You are one pot loving mother [bleep] pain in the rectum.
David Moser,I just whizzed on a butterfly!
David Moser,The actual job's a nightmare.
David Moser,"You know, Michael?"
David Moser,Right.
David Moser,Clarence was old and weak.
David Moser,Hey.
Denise Yermley,Some of them want to use youâ¦
Denise Yermley,Sweet dreams are made of this
Dennis Feinstein,I'm happy to help.
Dennis Feinstein,Make it rain!
Dennis Feinstein,Ooh!
Dennis Feinstein,I gotta go kill my dad.
Dennis Feinstein,Let's go.
Dennis Feinstein,Upload it to my GryzzlGlass.
Dennis Feinstein,Left eye.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm watching porn with my right eye.
Dennis Feinstein,It's assaultive.
Dennis Feinstein,It takes everything in my power to not retch right now.
Dennis Feinstein,"Kid, you need to find another game."
Dennis Feinstein,Leave perfumery to the real men.
Dennis Feinstein,Who did this?
Dennis Feinstein,The Hounds is an FDA rejected cologne I've been working on that makes everything smell like wet dog.
Dennis Feinstein,You have 30 seconds to get out of this facility.
Dennis Feinstein,You will pay for this!
Dennis Feinstein,"Eddie, get my crossbow."
Dennis Feinstein,"It's nothing, really."
Dennis Feinstein,#NAME?
Dennis Feinstein,In your face! Dennis Feinstein helps no man! Get the hell out of my office!
Dennis Feinstein,Release the Hounds!
Dennis Feinstein,Hey now.
Dennis Feinstein,I am nourished by your hatred!
Dennis Feinstein,This could be bad for business.
Dennis Feinstein,I had no idea this place was so loved.
Dennis Feinstein,Hmm?
Dennis Feinstein,"Plus, who's gonna miss some dumpy diner?"
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna turn that place into an elbow art salon and make a killing.
Dennis Feinstein,Real estate prices in this turd town are through the roof.
Dennis Feinstein,That's true.
Dennis Feinstein,Okay.
Dennis Feinstein,I gotta go pull the plug on my dad in 10 minutes.
Dennis Feinstein,Who's that?
Dennis Feinstein,What?
Dennis Feinstein,Higgins is missing.
Dennis Feinstein,I have to meet Rick and TC at the King Kamehameha Club.
Dennis Feinstein,"But I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go."
Dennis Feinstein,That feels amazing.
Dennis Feinstein,"Oh, baby."
Dennis Feinstein,"Well, make it quick."
Dennis Feinstein,"I should also let you know, you are all trespassing on private property."
Dennis Feinstein,"Plus, you should get these kids out of here."
Dennis Feinstein,You got 'em well trained.
Dennis Feinstein,Give me your boos!
Dennis Feinstein,"Oh, yeah."
Dennis Feinstein,I bought it for a song and I'm gonna sell it for a mint and you can all just sit there pulling on your puds.
Dennis Feinstein,Do you think I care about how much you love this stupid diner?
Dennis Feinstein,Psych!
Dennis Feinstein,"I just have one more thing to say, Pawnee."
Dennis Feinstein,JJ's can stay.
Dennis Feinstein,"Not to brag, but my colognes have been known to stunt human growth, soâ¦"
Dennis Feinstein,You convinced me.
Dennis Feinstein,"People of Pawnee, I just came down here to tell you how much I appreciate your passion."
Dennis Feinstein,Thank you.
Dennis Feinstein,"Now, Leslie, I think everybody's gonna wanna hear what I have to say."
Dennis Feinstein,Hang on.
Dennis Feinstein,Stop the clock.
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,You've been heard loud and clear.
Dennis Feinstein,Horrible!
Dennis Feinstein,"I'd love to smell it, right?"
Dennis Feinstein,"Go out there and help some kids with their pink eye, or whatever it is you guys are doing."
Dennis Feinstein,"Now, that's the kind of guy I can hang out with Mark Cuban."
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
Dennis Feinstein,Not just anybody can do this.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm interested now.
Dennis Feinstein,Keep talking.
Dennis Feinstein,Okay.
Dennis Feinstein,"Although it's a great name, and I'm probably gonna steal it."
Dennis Feinstein,You know what?
Dennis Feinstein,Shut up.
Dennis Feinstein,"You guys seem like pretty cool dudes and I'm feeling pretty generous, so why don't we take this conversation to the Pawnee Smokehouse?"
Dennis Feinstein,"Dumb Dumb Eddie, get the checkbook."
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,"Guys, we're going out."
Dennis Feinstein,Let's scent up!
Dennis Feinstein,"All right, I get it."
Dennis Feinstein,Cuban?
Dennis Feinstein,Are you calling me a nerd?
Dennis Feinstein,Is this some sort of nerd thing?
Dennis Feinstein,"Bill Gates is, like, a super nerd."
Dennis Feinstein,"Yeah, man."
Dennis Feinstein,I'm crazy busy.
Dennis Feinstein,"But all day long, people are pitching me colognes."
Dennis Feinstein,That guy just pitched me a cologne called Sluts.
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, legally, if you're from the FDA, you have to tell me."
Dennis Feinstein,Are you from the FDA?
Dennis Feinstein,I don't recommend that.
Dennis Feinstein,Yeah.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna cut right to the chase.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't get it.
Dennis Feinstein,"Feels to me like I'm giving money away, and getting nothing in return."
Dennis Feinstein,"If I give as much as I get, I'm giving 20 million dollars."
Dennis Feinstein,Ay yi yi.
Dennis Feinstein,"That's how much I'm worth, 20 million dollars. Yeah."
Dennis Feinstein,Huh.
Dennis Feinstein,I know who Bill Gates is.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't like charity.
Dennis Feinstein,"Ooh, no, don't use that one."
Dennis Feinstein,"Eh, go ahead."
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, they claim that smoking is bad for you, but is there any medical evidence to back that up?"
Dennis Feinstein,How dare you talk to me like that?
Dennis Feinstein,Where are your manners?
Dennis Feinstein,Great.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't think so.
Dennis Feinstein,Wrap it up!
Dennis Feinstein,We're done!
Dennis Feinstein,Hey!
Dennis Feinstein,Excuse me?
Dennis Feinstein,Show these garbage people out!
Dennis Feinstein,It's a gag scent.
Dennis Feinstein,Hilarious!
Dennis Feinstein,"Well, well, well."
Dennis Feinstein,Look who's back.
Dennis Feinstein,Thank you for saying that.
Dennis Feinstein,"Thought about it last night, and I decided that if you came in here and apologized to me like a man, that I would forgive you, and that's what you've done, so you're forgiven."
Dennis Feinstein,"To that end, here is a check for 25,000 dollars for your charity."
Dennis Feinstein,"Take the garbage out, Eddie."
Dennis Feinstein,It smells like somebody spilled Chinese food in a bird cage.
Dennis Feinstein,Boo!
Dennis Feinstein,I have heard so much talking from you.
Dennis Feinstein,Snooze.
Dennis Feinstein,You guys ever been fox hunting?
Dennis Feinstein,I have my own foxes flown in from Russia.
Dennis Feinstein,We drug them pretty heavily so they can't get very far.
Dennis Feinstein,"In fact, mostly, they just flop around on the ground."
Dennis Feinstein,"Makes it easier to just walk up and ""pow!"""
Dennis Feinstein,Stupid foxes.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't want to hear your fat mouth say anything else.
Dennis Feinstein,It's deeply erotic.
Dennis Feinstein,"Wear whatever you want, as long as it's not too bright or reflective."
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, I want you blending in to the surroundings."
Dennis Feinstein,How fast can you run?
Dennis Feinstein,Then don't.
Dennis Feinstein,Boom!
Dennis Feinstein,Ha ha!
Dennis Feinstein,Shut him right down!
Dennis Feinstein,We should go hunting sometime.
Dennis Feinstein,"You come to me asking for money, and you treat me like this?"
Dennis Feinstein,We're going out.
Dennis Feinstein,"You're crazy, man."
Dennis Feinstein,We'll be in touch.
Dennis Feinstein,Ben Wyatt.
Dennis Feinstein,Great to meet you.
Dennis Feinstein,"I'm, uh, this."
Dennis Feinstein,"Please, call me Dennis Feinstein."
Dennis Feinstein,"I'm gonna cut right to the chase, Ben."
Dennis Feinstein,This cologne company is my life's work.
Dennis Feinstein,"Listen, Ben, I'm gonna cut right to the chase, okay?"
Dennis Feinstein,What am I talking about?
Dennis Feinstein,Why should I trust you with my perfumery?
Dennis Feinstein,Don't talk to Eddie.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm talking about the best vacation of my life.
Dennis Feinstein,I like you I've always liked you but I also like Eddie.
Dennis Feinstein,"Eddie's my current CFO, but I might fire him and hire you."
Dennis Feinstein,You got kids?
Dennis Feinstein,That's good.
Dennis Feinstein,Dumdum Eddie has two kids.
Dennis Feinstein,"Treat him like you would treat a person in another country that you paid $25,000 to hunt."
Dennis Lerpiss,"But if you want a film about the ocean, we have a documentary about the brutality of Japan's whaling industry."
Dennis Lerpiss,It's called Tears Of My Blowhole.
Dennis Lerpiss,And it's it's nauseating.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Oh, we only have Japanese slime candy and, um, Bulgarian wheat balls."
Dennis Lerpiss,I've seen the first 90 seconds.
Dennis Lerpiss,What?
Dennis Lerpiss,No.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Ooh, we don't carry cartoons."
Dennis Lerpiss,Hey.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Like, uh, get the Tarkovsky movies with the subtitles."
Dennis Lerpiss,"For those of you that have attended our screenings, I want to thank you for your patronage, though I wish you would have rented more movies."
Dennis Lerpiss,"No, no."
Dennis Lerpiss,"Speaking of which, sadly, next month, Pawnee Videodome will be closing its doors."
Dennis Lerpiss,The reason I love that film is that it's really depressing.
Dennis Lerpiss,"I could do, uh, Shoah."
Dennis Lerpiss,It's about three men who refuse to go on a suicide mission and are executed for cowardice.
Dennis Lerpiss,Today we'll be screening Stanley Kubrick's 1957 classic Paths Of Glory.
Dennis Lerpiss,Welcome to Pawnee Videodome.
Dennis Lerpiss,Hello.
Dennis Lerpiss,I took your advice.
Dennis Lerpiss,Come on.
Dennis Lerpiss,"I am definitely better off than I was a year ago, and it's all thanks to Leslie Knope."
Dennis Lerpiss,This woman singlehandedly saved my business.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Oh, I run a pornographic DVD emporium."
Dennis Lerpiss,Forever.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Got rid of all those dusty, old foreign films and used the money for the part of our business that's always done pretty well for us."
Dennis Lerpiss,It's thrilling.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Give the people what they want, right?"
Denver,Everybody! Check under your seats!
Derek,I said she's a bitch.
Derek,"Yeah, I'll just write in ""bitch."""
Derek,Whatever.
Derek,"Yeah, what's up now, huh?"
Derek,Terrible moonwalk.
Derek,Get me another beer.
Derek,"If I win, you clean my house for a month."
Derek,"But if you're so great, let's play again."
Derek,I don't know who Ron is.
Derek,I destroyed you.
Derek,"Yeah, right."
Derek,Leslie Knope!
Derek,"Yeah, no, um, I don't think so."
Derek,I did.
Derek,No.
Derek,I'm a straight person.
Derek,See you around.
Derek,See?
Derek,Because old people are funny.
Derek,We can get you a drink bracelet.
Derek,Valentine's bash at The Bulge tonight.
Derek,I'm not one to complain about free beer and free bowling.
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,Hi.
Derek,What the hell?
Derek,"I don't like you, okay?"
Derek,It's not that complicated.
Derek,"None of the other politicians ever take a stand, and it means a lot to the whole gay community."
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,"Leslie Knope, you're my hero!"
Derek,"He's not gay, but if he were, I would totally break up with Ben for him."
Derek,You can either make out with both of us or none of us.
Derek,"No, he's my boyfriend."
Derek,"Fine, then you can't make out with me when you're drunk anymore."
Derek,"Ever since you've been hanging out with that meathead, you've become completely lame."
Derek,Here's something un-ironic.
Derek,"I'll take you for an ice cream malted, and then we can go choose our caskets."
Derek,Yes.
Derek,Let me tell you about the Civil War.
Derek,"Come here, sonny."
Derek,"No, we just thought it'd be funny to see April doing physical labor."
Derek,"Later, bro."
Derek,Hi.
Derek,"Hey, bro, wanna go get our grub on?"
Derek,"Just chillaxin' like your new bro, Andy."
Derek,We're just kidding.
Derek,Let's go to dinner.
Derek,Why are you being weird? We make fun of people like that.
Derek,That's what we do.
Derek,I have to go get ready.
Derek,It'd be amazing if you came.
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,I feel like you're being kind of a bitch right now.
Derek,"Yeah, we did."
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,"Yeah, she seems a little uptight."
Derek,Who's that?
Derek,"My sister has scoliosis, and I think you might, you know"
Derek,16
Derek,Love them.
Derek,Why are you mad?
Derek,You bowled a strike.
Derek,It's your turn.
Derek,You watch Ice Road Truckers?
Derek,Cool.
Derek,"She doesn't seem like the kind of person you could go bowling with, you know?"
Derek,Try not to break a nail.
Derek,"Hey, could you get me another one of these?"
Derek,You okay?
Derek,Sure.
Derek,"Oh, uh, I got a weird invitation in the mail."
Derry Murbles,My guest today is author Leslie Knope.
Derry Murbles,"You must admit, Ms. Knope, that the merging of the towns has been fraught with antipathy."
Derry Murbles,"For example, I now have to share my studio with a fatuous twerp who shall remain nameless."
Derry Murbles,"Leslie, would you like to take us out?"
Derry Murbles,That's all the time we have on Thought For Your Thoughts.
Derry Murbles,"Leslie, would you like to introduce the next segment?"
Derry Murbles,"Join us next week when David Bianculli will be filling in for Richard Chang Jefferson, who will be filling in for me."
Derry Murbles,We have not seen him since.

Derry Murbles,"Welcome to Thoughts for your thoughts I'm Derry Murbles filling in for David Parker, who took off for eight months to study the migration patterns of our nation's squirrels."
Derry Murbles,"Leslie, could one say that a book is nothing more than a painting of words, which are the notes on the tapestry of the greatest film ever sculpted?"
Derry Murbles,The book: Pawnee: The greatest town in America.
Derry Murbles,I'm Derry Murbles.
Derry Murbles,Absorb the aggression.
Derry Murbles,"Coming up after the break, movie reviews with Ken Tucker who is filling in for David Bianculli who's in New York filling in for Ken Tucker."
Derry Murbles,They're quite awful.
Derry Murbles,Research shows that our listeners love jazz.
Derry Murbles,"A Bat Signal, for listeners who might not know, refers to the children's character ""the Bat Man"" a strong gentleman who fights crime nocturnally."
Derry Murbles,My guest today is City Councilwoman Leslie Knope.
Derry Murbles,"I'm your Pawneean host, Derry Murbles."
Derry Murbles,"Absorb the aggression, Derry."
Derry Murbles,"I'm your host Derry Murbles, sitting in for Nina Joplin, who is touring the country performing a spokenword opera about pearshaped women."
Derry Murbles,"Welcome to ""Thought For Your Thoughts."""
Derry Murbles,"Oh, yes."
Derry Murbles,"Leslie, thought--"
Derry Murbles,Our guest is former city councilwoman Leslie Knope.
Derry Murbles,"Yes, if you have not heard our program in a while, Thought For Your Thoughts now has a cohost, thanks to the Pawnee Eagleton merger"
Derry Murbles,"But they are lesbians, so."
Derry Murbles,I'd like to apologize to our listeners for my cohost's sudden and violent outburst just now.
Detlef Schrempf,Light beers.
Detlef Schrempf,Waste of time.
Detlef Schrempf,They wouldn't know a nonemployee tax reportable expenditure request if it bit them in the ass.
Detlef Schrempf,Ever thought about scaling back a bit and focusing on building your client base?
Detlef Schrempf,You have a lot of overhead here.
Detlef Schrempf,"I don't know, man."
Detlef Schrempf,"Well, on behalf of the Detlef Schrempf Foundation, I would like to present this check for 5,000 dollars for diabetes research."
Detlef Schrempf,"Thanks, Tom."
Detlef Schrempf,"So, Tom, what does this business do, again?"
Detlef Schrempf,He had two beers.
Detlef Schrempf,"Do you know what, I think we should be heading to that telethon."
Detlef Schrempf,All right.
Detlef Schrempf,"What, you a big fan of that show?"
Detlef Schrempf,Huh?
Detlef Schrempf,"Oh, 6'10""."
Detlef Schrempf,"So, you looked me up on Wikipedia, huh?"
Detlef Schrempf,"Yeah, you don't have to sit so far up."
Detlef Schrempf,Yeah.
Dewey,Okay.
Dewey,All right.
Dewey,"Put in truck""?"
Dewey,"Not that many women apply, plus it's a very physically demanding job."
Dewey,Your average woman can't handle it.
Dewey,So you agree.
Dewey,We only have one bathroom now.
Dewey,"""Pick up garbage."
Dewey,"Ever since you stripped us of our freedoms by making us hire women, we've had to turn one of our bathrooms into a woman's bathroom."
Dewey,My name is Dewey from Sanitation.
Dewey,What do they say?
Diane Lewis,Diane Lewis.
Diane Lewis,What's with the getup?
Diane Lewis,"Hey, Leslie."
Diane Lewis,"It's a bit unusual, but we both"
Diane Lewis,Would you ladies like to come?
Diane Lewis,"Easy, girls."
Diane Lewis,We just wanted to invite you to come trick or treating tonight.
Diane Lewis,I assume you can deal with that.
Diane Lewis,"I just picked up the girls, thought we'd stop by."
Diane Lewis,Am I interrupting something important?
Diane Lewis,Hey.
Diane Lewis,"Leslie Knope, would you please be my matron of honor?"
Diane Lewis,Diane Tammy Lewis.
Diane Lewis,"Just kidding, it's Elizabeth."
Diane Lewis,"Yes, I do."
Diane Lewis,"You can come, sure."
Diane Lewis,"In fact, the smaller the better."
Diane Lewis,We've both been married before.
Diane Lewis,Sounds perfect.
Diane Lewis,Hi.
Diane Lewis,Hey.
Diane Lewis,I'm sorry.
Diane Lewis,Some idiot kids were caught pooping on the soccer field?
Diane Lewis,I have to leave.
Diane Lewis,Vice principal emergency.
Diane Lewis,"Oh, no."
Diane Lewis,It's a nightmare.
Diane Lewis,All princesses all the time.
Diane Lewis,"Every book, every movie, every backpack."
Diane Lewis,Can we talk?
Diane Lewis,I don't want anything big or elaborate.
Diane Lewis,Maybe in private.
Diane Lewis,"Oh, for the last four years everything has been princesses."
Diane Lewis,So I am pregnant.
Diane Lewis,I don't understand how.
Diane Lewis,We were so careful.
Diane Lewis,"I got about a million thoughts running around in my head, but I really just want to know what you're thinking."
Diane Lewis,Ron Swanson.
Diane Lewis,Yes.
Diane Lewis,On one condition.
Diane Lewis,Just the opposite.
Diane Lewis,Can we talk? Maybe in private?
Diane Lewis,"Come on, girls."
Diane Lewis,"Now, ladies, Princess Mommy has to go take care of some bad guys, so you be nice to Ron and Andy, okay?"
Diane Lewis,"Oh, that's so sweet of you."
Diane Lewis,No need to wear makeup.
Diane Lewis,"Oh, you're not even from the Public Works Department?"
Diane Lewis,"Oh, I know that look."
Diane Lewis,Have some fun.
Diane Lewis,Get up there.
Diane Lewis,I want this to be a fair fight.
Diane Lewis,"Yes, please officer, get her out of those cuffs."
Diane Lewis,Go on.
Diane Lewis,"But not France, right?"
Diane Lewis,Everything going good?
Diane Lewis,I'm worried that maybe there isn't room in your life for another woman.
Diane Lewis,It's you.
Diane Lewis,"You and Ron have an intimacy that I just don't understand, so if there is a threat to my relationship with Ron, it's not Tammy."
Diane Lewis,"You're the one who's been protecting him, you're the one who knows all the intimate details of his romantic history with that monster."
Diane Lewis,You're the one who's been at his side all night.
Diane Lewis,You you.
Diane Lewis,What concerns me is you.
Diane Lewis,"Yeah, Ron."
Diane Lewis,"She just knows you so well, and I was starting to wonder if I was ever gonna get to that point."
Diane Lewis,"I'm sorry, it's just-- your face is ridiculous."
Diane Lewis,Where is she?
Diane Lewis,"Bye, Tammy."
Diane Lewis,"So, dinner?"
Diane Lewis,Does that freak you out?
Diane Lewis,I don't screw around.
Diane Lewis,I'm a middle school vice-principal.
Diane Lewis,"Well, I hope you're not the kind of man who needs to ask the lady out."
Diane Lewis,"Actually, I'm here to ask you out for dinner."
Diane Lewis,Hey!
Diane Lewis,"You survived, huh?"
Diane Lewis,How were they?
Diane Lewis,Really?
Diane Lewis,"Well, that's good."
Diane Lewis,"'Cause my sitter's still out of town, so I really hate to ask you this, but is there any way you could take them again tomorrow?"
Diane Lewis,You're a lifesaver.
Diane Lewis,Thank you.
Diane Lewis,"Girls, you wanna spend another day with Ron?"
Diane Lewis,"You know, I don't think that the girls have ever been happier or more surprised than when you got up on that stage."
Diane Lewis,Always a pleasure.
Diane Lewis,Now I can fix the next one myself.
Diane Lewis,I own this pothole.
Diane Lewis,I deal with hormonal psychopaths all the time.
Diane Lewis,I'm not worried about Tammy.
Diane Lewis,"Hey, I'm sorry if I was curt earlier."
Diane Lewis,I don't know.
Diane Lewis,They'd be crazy not to vote for you.
Diane Lewis,"Hey, you most certainly do."
Diane Lewis,Yours is the winner.
Diane Lewis,"Well, it'll be casual."
Diane Lewis,Lemonade?
Diane Lewis,"I'm a single mom, and sometimes things get chaotic around here."
Diane Lewis,"Look, obviously, I want to say Gryffindor But I've got to go with Hufflepuff."
Diane Lewis,Go over and say hello.
Diane Lewis,I can see why he didn't tell me that.
Diane Lewis,Do you know what you're doing?
Diane Lewis,I don't even know what his middle name is.
Diane Lewis,He's not a big sharer.
Diane Lewis,"Oh, yeah."
Diane Lewis,Oh.
Diane Lewis,Go on then.
Diane Lewis,Hey.
Diane Lewis,Subtle.
Diane Lewis,When you showed up from the Parks Department
Diane Lewis,He disappeared after the speech and I can't find him anywhere.
Diane Lewis,Have you seen Ron?
Diane Lewis,"Well, thank you."
Diane Lewis,Hey.
Diane Lewis,Just for my own edification.
Diane Lewis,"So, how exactly are you gonna fix this hole?"
Diane Lewis,Right?
Diane Lewis,"Oh, my God."
Diane Lewis,What happened?
Diane Lewis,"Well, who has been having fun with scissors?"
Diane Lewis,"Well, I got it from Food and Stuff, so"
Diane Lewis,Yay!
Diane Lewis,"No, it's fine."
Diane Lewis,They're kids.
Diane Lewis,"Once, Zoe put Ivy in the dryer, so"
Diane Lewis,It is so sweet to me how much you care.
Diane Lewis,This is why I love you.
Diane Lewis,"I mean, I'm a middle school vice principal."
Diane Lewis,"It's beautiful, Ron."
Diane Lewis,"Where have you been? I had a flat tire, and I've been trying to get in touch with you for hours."
Diane Lewis,Got a minute?
Diane Lewis,You ruined their Halloween.
Diane Lewis,"My kids are non-negotiable, Ron."
Diane Lewis,It's a package deal.
Diane Lewis,"Okay, what do you say, girls?"
Diane Lewis,"I love you, but your solution to every problem is to live inside a mountain."
Diane Lewis,"Well, you don't have to be entirely on the grid, but have to be on our grid."
Diane Lewis,Don't you feel a little bit bad about that?
Diane Lewis,Very romantic.
Diane Lewis,Goodbye.
Diane Lewis,Do you wanna say anything to me?
Diane Lewis,I just wanted to say that I am sorry for the way I reacted.
Diane Lewis,"Yeah, I was a bit stressed, but I'm not here to make excuses."
Diane Lewis,You can't just roam the streets in an RV and be impossible to find.
Diane Lewis,"Ron, I know you value your privacy, but you are a husband and a father now."
Diane Lewis,"You having fun, ladies?"
Diane Lewis,Too late.
Diane Lewis,You broke my daughter's tiara.
Diane Lewis,"Okay, girls, this is a magic phone, okay? Only you and I have got the numbers."
Diane Lewis,"So if you ever need Ron for any reason, you just call and he'll be there in a flash."
Don Swanson,Pleasure to meet you.
Don Swanson,You worked at the Parks Department?
Don Swanson,Should we discuss your retirement package?
Don Swanson,Agreed.
Donna Meagle,Your family has made you a more patient and empathetic person.
Donna Meagle,The gala ends at 11:00.
Donna Meagle,Got some bad news.
Donna Meagle,I didn't go to my prom.
Donna Meagle,I was dating an older fella back then.
Donna Meagle,"Hello, everyone."
Donna Meagle,Like I'm gonna dance with a bunch of kids while he's coaching Duke to the final four.
Donna Meagle,Macklin's the hottest.
Donna Meagle,I promise not to cheat on you if you promise not to try to pin me down too fast.
Donna Meagle,"When we're together, all we do is have sex, sit on the couch, eat homemade pasta, have sex again."
Donna Meagle,"The good news is, at 11:01, we'll be holding a special wedding ceremony."
Donna Meagle,You can take me to dinner Friday.
Donna Meagle,That's not true.
Donna Meagle,"He loves a lot of dumb stuff, but he loves you the most."
Donna Meagle,I'll wear that red thing when you deserve to see me in that red thing.
Donna Meagle,So I'm going to dinner with Joe next week.
Donna Meagle,It's always nice to see someone actually change for the better.
Donna Meagle,I was talking about you.
Donna Meagle,Sometimes I disappear for a day or two 'cause I'm flyfishing or I'm at a Seattle Sounders game.
Donna Meagle,"He's constantly being respectful, wanting to spend time with me, trying to ""connect"" with me."
Donna Meagle,I'll hit you up when I hit you up.
Donna Meagle,All the drinks and the food will be on us.
Donna Meagle,Wha?
Donna Meagle,Bird bath salts.
Donna Meagle,"I don't know, Marcus."
Donna Meagle,I want to watch it.
Donna Meagle,Something interesting is happening.
Donna Meagle,"I'm sorry, Marcus, I'm gonna have to cancel our bath."
Donna Meagle,Respect.
Donna Meagle,I like to do things.
Donna Meagle,Champagne decanters!
Donna Meagle,This is heaven.
Donna Meagle,Everything would be peachy if it weren't for that dumbass with a megaphone.
Donna Meagle,Look at that tie dimple.
Donna Meagle,Damn.
Donna Meagle,"Personalized, leopardprinted robe."
Donna Meagle,"It's great for your back, and your rear."
Donna Meagle,Pink feather cuffs.

Donna Meagle,Everyone is invited to stay.
Donna Meagle,Scandal's my favorite show.
Donna Meagle,"Come on, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,"If something's bothering you, just tell him."
Donna Meagle,It's always better to be direct.
Donna Meagle,I feel like I told you to wait in the car.
Donna Meagle,Will you pledge right now not to raise taxes?
Donna Meagle,Trust me.
Donna Meagle,You should listen to him.
Donna Meagle,"No pledge, no vote."
Donna Meagle,Those books are good.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, I love any book about vampires, werewolves, monsters, zombies, sorcerers, beasties or time traveling romances."
Donna Meagle,"And if I had an hour alone with Robert Pattinson, he would forget all about Skinnylegs McGee."
Donna Meagle,I'll tell you that much.
Donna Meagle,'Cause nobody wants to steal a Saturn.
Donna Meagle,No way.
Donna Meagle,This is not the way to the mall.
Donna Meagle,I'm not street parking my Mercedes.
Donna Meagle,"Well, where is Bluntz taking us?"
Donna Meagle,"Um, can we talk about that disastrous interaction you just had with Lucy?"
Donna Meagle,It's gonna be hella fun.

Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self

Donna Meagle,Cool.
Donna Meagle,Don't worry about me.
Donna Meagle,I'm a grown woman with a good head on her shoulders.
Donna Meagle,Are you asking me if I'm pregnant?
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,"""Please bring cooked steak."""
Donna Meagle,Did you think even two years ago you'd be playing matchmaker for me while wearing a glittery crown?
Donna Meagle,Go Macklin.

Donna Meagle,You okay?
Donna Meagle,Fragrances.
Donna Meagle,How are the kids?
Donna Meagle,I didn't post anything on Gryzzl Feed 'cause I wanted to tell you in person.
Donna Meagle,Joe popped the question a few days ago.
Donna Meagle,Shia LaBeouf designed wedding dresses do not come cheap.
Donna Meagle,And I'm gonna need the money for my wedding.
Donna Meagle,Ron hired Regal Meagle Realty to broker the deal.
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,My boyfriend-- my friend Joe has the hookup at all the good preschools.
Donna Meagle,I am not surprised at all.
Donna Meagle,I've been to South America.
Donna Meagle,I did very well there.
Donna Meagle,What the?
Donna Meagle,Massages.
Donna Meagle,How are you?
Donna Meagle,I wanna go home.
Donna Meagle,"""Thanks for nothing, Donna Meagle."""
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,"If you're going to do it, this is a good time."
Donna Meagle,"Nahuh, I always go negative."
Donna Meagle,Even if I like the guy I go negative.
Donna Meagle,Keeps 'em interested.
Donna Meagle,Geez.
Donna Meagle,You so get it.
Donna Meagle,You're the cutest little boobear I've ever seen.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, he's so cute."
Donna Meagle,"That went better, right?"
Donna Meagle,So?
Donna Meagle,Hey! Look at that! You finally made it in the top 10.
Donna Meagle,Now you can enter your initials.
Donna Meagle,Real estate is pretty cheap right now.
Donna Meagle,Then just put in any three letters.
Donna Meagle,Ron!
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,You're in Bloosh!
Donna Meagle,Ron is in Bloosh!
Donna Meagle,Annabel says that buying an island is the only real way to know that your goji-berry farm is pesticide-free.
Donna Meagle,Someone's getting a new leather jacket.
Donna Meagle,It's for me.
Donna Meagle,This is a great day!
Donna Meagle,Ron's in Bloosh!
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,Ron's in Bloosh!
Donna Meagle,Do it.
Donna Meagle,Talk more about that tantric workshop y'all went to.
Donna Meagle,Come on.
Donna Meagle,Kill it.
Donna Meagle,Don't worry.
Donna Meagle,The Amazon.
Donna Meagle,Three weeks of the best and most expensive places South America has to offer.
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,My poor little do-gooder teacher baby.
Donna Meagle,"Why don't we cuddle up on the couch, watch a movie, and then maybe later, I'll wear that little red thing?"
Donna Meagle,Call Satan's Niece.
Donna Meagle,And this is me DJing a boat party in Venezuela.
Donna Meagle,Kind of reminded me of the two weeks you and I spent there.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it did."
Donna Meagle,"Babe, have a seat."
Donna Meagle,"Recently, I was thinking, for the millionth time, how lucky I am to have found you."
Donna Meagle,"So, I've decided to treat yo' self."
Donna Meagle,It's not human.
Donna Meagle,It's called Teach Yo' Self.
Donna Meagle,"For music, art, math, whatever you want."
Donna Meagle,This is what I want.
Donna Meagle,I've had a lot of adventures.
Donna Meagle,I single-handedly started that doorknockers earring trend.
Donna Meagle,I came in ninth in Italy's Got Talent.
Donna Meagle,I served on a NASCAR pit crew.
Donna Meagle,"I want a new kind of adventure, and I want to take it with you."
Donna Meagle,Just keep it short and get the hell out of there.
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Donna Meagle,"You want to go back and play that video game, don't you?"
Donna Meagle,Poodles only.
Donna Meagle,Luxury dog park.
Donna Meagle,And you and the other teachers will get money for afterschool programs.
Donna Meagle,You're gonna want to shut your mouth right now.
Donna Meagle,"What? Listen, you are a hot, young doctor."
Donna Meagle,"Yes, indeed."
Donna Meagle,"Bring it in, boy."
Donna Meagle,You're fired.
Donna Meagle,Then you tried to blow up my spot online.
Donna Meagle,"You tried to adopt a cat last week and I turned you down, because I thought it was too sad for you to have six cats."
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I did, troll."
Donna Meagle,Here you go.
Donna Meagle,Love it.
Donna Meagle,In a manner of speaking.
Donna Meagle,Joe and I spend most of our time on the foundation.
Donna Meagle,Maybe you're right.
Donna Meagle,"By the way, what time is it? Oh, it looks like it's half past spla-dow!"
Donna Meagle,"So, are you going to have another one?"
Donna Meagle,Treat yourself 2011.
Donna Meagle,Finally.
Donna Meagle,I'm about to come down on this dude like Thor's hammer Mjolnir.
Donna Meagle,Ignore it?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, no."
Donna Meagle,In this building?
Donna Meagle,Just give me the IP address of the dude that gave me that cracked-out Yelp review.
Donna Meagle,I'm about to hunt you down.
Donna Meagle,This freak thinks he can hide behind some anonymous user name?
Donna Meagle,"With five ""O""s."
Donna Meagle,"""Booooo!"""
Donna Meagle,It's the best day of the year!
Donna Meagle,"""Stopped by to adopt a dog, but the employee, Donna Meagle, was nowhere to be found."""
Donna Meagle,Some fool just slammed me on Yelp.
Donna Meagle,I'm about to go Mjolnir on his ass!
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,You're fired.
Donna Meagle,"Okay, I don't know you."
Donna Meagle,But I do know that you can fix your attitude.
Donna Meagle,Cool?
Donna Meagle,"From now on, we say what we feel."
Donna Meagle,He gets it.
Donna Meagle,You know what I'm saying?
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, but our work is just beginning."
Donna Meagle,"So, you want to get out of here?"
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry I toyed with you instead of coming at you straight.
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry I bailed on work.
Donna Meagle,I dragged Kyle in here to see if you would come clean.
Donna Meagle,"It was a review of a funeral home that said ""Great first date spot."""
Donna Meagle,I checked what else that user had written.
Donna Meagle,I know.
Donna Meagle,"Oof, you got a long way to go, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,"Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing you trade your legs for angel's wings and once we've all said good-bye you take a running leap, and you learn to fly"
Donna Meagle,"Let's go again, from the top."
Donna Meagle,Let's make this fast.
Donna Meagle,I almost made it with Councilman Howser before you interrupted us.
Donna Meagle,Which files did you delete?
Donna Meagle,Fixed it.
Donna Meagle,"All right, Chris and Ann!"
Donna Meagle,Jerry accidentally deletes things all the time.
Donna Meagle,"Ten years ago, I installed my own secret backup."
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, this just got real good!"
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you're on fire."
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,Clothes.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, read the cake."
Donna Meagle,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Donna Meagle,Ginuwine's my cousin.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, we're adorable, but this is creepy."
Donna Meagle,Honeybear and Sugar Plum are the special names Joe and I call each other.
Donna Meagle,Two honey bears and a canister of sugar plums.
Donna Meagle,"Keep walking, 98."
Donna Meagle,He's a linebacker.
Donna Meagle,These are my free gifts.
Donna Meagle,Skill positions only for Donna Meagle.
Donna Meagle,"You didn't tell that girl you love her, did you?"
Donna Meagle,"No offense, Leslie, but I'm not an artist."
Donna Meagle,"Um, I pay someone to do this."
Donna Meagle,Absolutely not.
Donna Meagle,"So, it's the Last Supper, but with famous people from Indiana."
Donna Meagle,"You know, I'm gonna miss you too, Perkins."
Donna Meagle,"John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, uh, David Letterman, Vivica A. Fox."
Donna Meagle,Because there's not that many celebrities from Indiana.
Donna Meagle,"So, a NASCAR."
Donna Meagle,"Uh, my friend, Becky."
Donna Meagle,Ron Swanson.
Donna Meagle,That would be Greg Kinnear.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, how was the forum?"
Donna Meagle,What is so great about the shapes?
Donna Meagle,Greg Kinnear.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,Is Bill Paxton from Indiana?
Donna Meagle,And who's the man?
Donna Meagle,Is he famous?
Donna Meagle,"Okay, so, here's where it gets a little dicey."
Donna Meagle,"But now that you're officially out of the dating pool, you know I'm gonna run this town, right?"
Donna Meagle,Ooh.
Donna Meagle,Good looking out.
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,I'm going to get in line for some food.
Donna Meagle,Y'all want anything?
Donna Meagle,Do you know what you just did?
Donna Meagle,Ew.
Donna Meagle,You were not here when Ron and Tammy got divorced.
Donna Meagle,"I mean, did you steal this from a museum?"
Donna Meagle,"You wanna put me on blast, I'm gonna put you on front street."
Donna Meagle,I was.
Donna Meagle,Those two are crazy.
Donna Meagle,"I found one chair, got a lead on a second."
Donna Meagle,Gryzzl is going down.
Donna Meagle,I never would have agreed to work with them if I had known they were gonna be snoopin' in my biz.
Donna Meagle,Can you blame me?
Donna Meagle,I just wanna say that I've always thought you were hot.
Donna Meagle,Great leadership inspiring.
Donna Meagle,"The tables showed up, which is good, but there are no chairs, which is bad."
Donna Meagle,"Eh, he'll figure it out eventually."
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,How do they even know?
Donna Meagle,Quick question.
Donna Meagle,I'm not sure.
Donna Meagle,Why don't you spin around for me?
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,Because we only call each other these things on the phone or in texts.
Donna Meagle,Andy.
Donna Meagle,Is it Martin Landau?
Donna Meagle,Get out of here.
Donna Meagle,I wouldn't take the shapes over anything.
Donna Meagle,"This one is terrible, but it is slightly less terrible than the rest."
Donna Meagle,"Um, he's not there."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,"All right, I'll go."
Donna Meagle,No.
Donna Meagle,Black people still can't legally use city sidewalks.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, there is a woman on the phone that says her daughter's scared to go to sleep because Leslie Knope's going to come murder her kitty."
Donna Meagle,Fine leather goods.
Donna Meagle,Gin.
Donna Meagle,I'm chilling.
Donna Meagle,I didn't say anything.
Donna Meagle,You do not come at me like that.
Donna Meagle,"All right, I'll find him."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, no!"
Donna Meagle,It kind of looked like an office.
Donna Meagle,"I have ruined my share of hotel rooms, and trust me, nothing sexual happened in that room."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, no."
Donna Meagle,"Um, khakis and buttondown shirts your basic white people clothes."
Donna Meagle,"Fine, but if he raises his voice once, once, I'm out."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, guys! Hola!"
Donna Meagle,Why wouldn't it?
Donna Meagle,We just pull the business license it's public information and then at least you'll have an address.
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, here."
Donna Meagle,"Hmm, some kind of shady, fake shell corporation called ""Open 4 Business, LLC."""
Donna Meagle,"Hey, if it's Akon and y'all become best friends, I want a ride on his plane."
Donna Meagle,Nice.
Donna Meagle,"It's a bold flavor fruity, a little earthy."
Donna Meagle,What you need is some fresh meat in the office.
Donna Meagle,He's like a giant puppy with no shame.
Donna Meagle,Nothing embarrasses him.
Donna Meagle,"You, sir, said you would not vote for her, correct?"
Donna Meagle,Have you gotten one of these Gryzzl boxes?
Donna Meagle,You realize you've said that about all of them?
Donna Meagle,"I know I technically work for Gryzzl, but these fools have crossed a line."
Donna Meagle,"Knope, I need to talk to you."
Donna Meagle,Yes!
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,Are you broken?
Donna Meagle,The pride of Indiana.
Donna Meagle,Ah! Look at that.
Donna Meagle,He's like a skinny little rubber band that's about to snap in half.
Donna Meagle,But he really seems like he could use a day off.
Donna Meagle,What do you think about inviting Ben to come along with us today?
Donna Meagle,I got a question.
Donna Meagle,I'll go with him.
Donna Meagle,Seriously?
Donna Meagle,Do I look like I'm joking?
Donna Meagle,The best day of the year .
Donna Meagle,It's every woman for herself.
Donna Meagle,There are no friends here.
Donna Meagle,We're in the jungle.
Donna Meagle,It's the best day of the year.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, if it isn't Filo Pilo."
Donna Meagle,"Barking up the wrong tree, Filo."
Donna Meagle,Do you know where you are right now?
Donna Meagle,With the men in this office?
Donna Meagle,Andy will never be the new Jerry.
Donna Meagle,I'd take Jerry's murinal over this.
Donna Meagle,Maybe he just misses his little buddy.
Donna Meagle,"I don't know, he's got you doing Ben's job, eating lunch with him like Ben used to."
Donna Meagle,You mean hang out?
Donna Meagle,What are you making?
Donna Meagle,"You're Craig, right?"
Donna Meagle,Wasn't gonna.
Donna Meagle,"You nasty, Jerry."
Donna Meagle,Did you just pee your pants?
Donna Meagle,There's a Li'l Sebastian lookalike on the way what?
Donna Meagle,"Hi, I'm Donna."
Donna Meagle,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Donna Meagle,Get in.
Donna Meagle,No.
Donna Meagle,"Okay, final tally."
Donna Meagle,"Look, don't tell anyone, but I booked a special surprise."
Donna Meagle,Upstairs is Meagle space only.
Donna Meagle,"Aw, shucks, business is boomin'."
Donna Meagle,Not exactly.
Donna Meagle,Jerry filed 268 red files.
Donna Meagle,And 384 blue files.
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,"Well, he was so happy when you told him he was doing a great job that he spent 20 minutes on the phone telling Gayle about it."
Donna Meagle,No dirty shoes in the house.
Donna Meagle,No!
Donna Meagle,Burn.
Donna Meagle,Not so fast.
Donna Meagle,"He may have filed more blue ones, but they're almost all filed wrong."
Donna Meagle,Not surprising since he was a mess after you talked to him.
Donna Meagle,When did you make the switch to boxer briefs?
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Donna Meagle,So here's my list of duties.
Donna Meagle,Are you kidding me?
Donna Meagle,"Sell, baby."
Donna Meagle,Here's my idea.
Donna Meagle,Imagine the kind of treat yourself day we could have with the profits.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, have I never talked about this before?"
Donna Meagle,I'm talking pedicures on pedicures on pedicures.
Donna Meagle,Mmhmm.
Donna Meagle,Thank you.
Donna Meagle,But congrats.
Donna Meagle,Is this for real?
Donna Meagle,"No, no, this is not what we're doing right now."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God!"
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self 2017!
Donna Meagle,What is happening right now?
Donna Meagle,DJ Bluntz?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,"Maybe it's because he's my fiance and I love him, but I kind of like the grocery store one, too."
Donna Meagle,I miss my canopy bed.
Donna Meagle,See?
Donna Meagle,Be direct.
Donna Meagle,"I would like to address the fact that rule number seven says, ""no pets,"" and yet there is a three legged animal in my living room."
Donna Meagle,"If you follow these rules, we won't have a problem."
Donna Meagle,"""If you sons of bitches try to remove this typewriter, I'll kill you."""
Donna Meagle,You do not have access to it.
Donna Meagle,How about you?
Donna Meagle,"And if you listen closely, that is the bubbling of the hot tub."
Donna Meagle,I'm basically the office manager.
Donna Meagle,"Okay, now you write, ""Who is this?"""
Donna Meagle,Hmm.
Donna Meagle,These are the house rules.
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,We're not big on hospitality.
Donna Meagle,What are you doing here?
Donna Meagle,"My family has a lake house up in the foothills, but we keep it quiet."
Donna Meagle,How did you know about that?
Donna Meagle,You're pregnant.
Donna Meagle,Swanson?
Donna Meagle,"Come on, rubber band."
Donna Meagle,Tom.
Donna Meagle,"Donna Meagle, transpo, AKA rides in my Benz."
Donna Meagle,Alone?
Donna Meagle,On a bench?
Donna Meagle,Is he eating soup?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, lord."
Donna Meagle,Treat yourself 2011.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I can't be seen with you."
Donna Meagle,"So, I can get you a private VIP tour of the building, maybe you can snoop around."
Donna Meagle,Here's some more advice.
Donna Meagle,When do you leave?
Donna Meagle,"Well, those fools still think I work for them."
Donna Meagle,"If you get a man, I don't get that man."
Donna Meagle,"Well, it's funny you should mention privacy, because that's our next topic."
Donna Meagle,Dating is a zerosum game.
Donna Meagle,French.
Donna Meagle,Chris Traeger!
Donna Meagle,It looks like the original phone from the movie Wall Street.
Donna Meagle,Scheduling and security liaison.

Donna Meagle,"Anyway, I love you, and to thank you, I'm going to try not to hug you."
Donna Meagle,I'm going to hug you.

Donna Meagle,"One for pleasure, and one to cap off a long con I was running against Keith Sweat."
Donna Meagle,I've gotten two annulments.
Donna Meagle,That's why you've been off your game.
Donna Meagle,"You're a catch, Wyatt."
Donna Meagle,Excuse us.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, he's embarrassing himself and throwing away his career."
Donna Meagle,Treat yourself.
Donna Meagle,You're gonna be okay.
Donna Meagle,I live for the grid.
Donna Meagle,I'm listening to Jaleel Or No Deal.
Donna Meagle,"I don't want you to get recalled Knope, but damn, these people know how to pick a neck massager."
Donna Meagle,"And before you get on my case about those stickers, I already did 'em."

Donna Meagle,"3400 square feet, a beautiful view of Puget Sound, and if you look out this window, you can watch them build the new Space Haystack around the Space Needle."
Donna Meagle,"I know, that's kind of the point."
Donna Meagle,"So, what are we thinking?"
Donna Meagle,You cannot beat the Seattle real estate market.
Donna Meagle,No pooping.
Donna Meagle,So this was one of Eagleton's top sushi restaurants.
Donna Meagle,You know I don't give a [bleep].
Donna Meagle,'Cause you need a license.

Donna Meagle,Freddy Spaghetti ain't coming.
Donna Meagle,"Actually, Leslie, I just found out."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's not me I'm worried about."
Donna Meagle,My family arrives tonight.
Donna Meagle,"But also, because you're tough."
Donna Meagle,And I love you like a sister.
Donna Meagle,So I chose you as my maid of honor because you've become one of my best friends.
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, sometimes you're kind of annoying."
Donna Meagle,This is the last listing I have that isn't an active crime scene.
Donna Meagle,"I mean, I thought that was your thing."
Donna Meagle,"Well, a tire shop that sold donuts."
Donna Meagle,Used to be a donut shop.
Donna Meagle,"So, this is way under your budget."
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,You got Andy doing all your work for you?
Donna Meagle,"Look, the only reason I'm even on Twitter is to blow off steam about work and tweet nasty stuff to dudes with washboard abs."
Donna Meagle,"You really think I hate you, after all we've been through the last ten years?"
Donna Meagle,She's in your office.
Donna Meagle,The other ex-wife.
Donna Meagle,Not her.
Donna Meagle,Your ex-wife is back.
Donna Meagle,"Red alert, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I don't care."
Donna Meagle,That kid would be unstoppable.
Donna Meagle,I got something to add to your list.
Donna Meagle,"Your hair, my everything else."
Donna Meagle,"April, walk with me."
Donna Meagle,"Uh, can I request a brief recess?"

Donna Meagle,What'd it say?
Donna Meagle,"I don't know, I told her to leave you a voice mail."
Donna Meagle,"She said something came up, she'll call you later."
Donna Meagle,"Actually, Ann called while you were in the bathroom."
Donna Meagle,"Not to give you too much of a peek into my personal life, but this could have been way worse."
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, this is bad."
Donna Meagle,I come bearing gifts.
Donna Meagle,"First off, I got a dude in maintenance to open up that grate this morning."
Donna Meagle,"So here's your rings, keys, credit cards, and I found some heart medicine I assume is yours?"
Donna Meagle,"Also, I thought I'd bring over some fresh oranges for you and Gayle."
Donna Meagle,"You're one of a kind, Garry."
Donna Meagle,"And I just wanna thank you for taking me down memory lane, ya big B word."
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna get fired.
Donna Meagle,"""Buddy."""
Donna Meagle,Except the two helipads.
Donna Meagle,"This property is under your budget, and it's got everything on this wish list you gave me."
Donna Meagle,I don't have kids.
Donna Meagle,Let me call some people.
Donna Meagle,That's why I showed him all those crappy places.
Donna Meagle,I don't want to lose that weird little elf either.
Donna Meagle,"Damn, we should have coordinated."
Donna Meagle,Thank you.
Donna Meagle,"Look, I obviously never meant to embarrass the parks department."
Donna Meagle,At a library.
Donna Meagle,"When we canceled on him, he took another gig in Eagleton."

Donna Meagle,It's 4:00 in the morning.
Donna Meagle,I almost forgot.
Donna Meagle,"Basically, Tommy, when it comes to matters of the heart, I say, ""Treat yo' self."""
Donna Meagle,You won't know until you ask.
Donna Meagle,"Or should I say, ""Norman""? Uh-huh."
Donna Meagle,Be a man and ask her out.
Donna Meagle,"My advice to you is, if you want to be with Lucy, you have to be upfront with her about it."
Donna Meagle,Maybe you should wrap it up.
Donna Meagle,"Come on, I'll show some places in your price range."
Donna Meagle,"9,000 a month."

Donna Meagle,"Okay, I'm calling it."
Donna Meagle,"I have a date with my bathtub, a glass of red wine, and a gigantic fireman named Marcus."
Donna Meagle,"You don't mind this work, do you?"
Donna Meagle,"Nice work, girl."
Donna Meagle,Jean-Ralphio.
Donna Meagle,Got you a birthday shot.
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,Suit yourself.
Donna Meagle,"Um, that's a tough one."
Donna Meagle,Leslie!
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,Really?
Donna Meagle,"When you two spoon, who spoons who?"
Donna Meagle,"A ""Sorry You Lost Your Dream Job"" gift?"
Donna Meagle,Mmmhmm.
Donna Meagle,I'm in.
Donna Meagle,You guys will never believe what I just found on Jerry's Facebook.
Donna Meagle,"You gotta dangle the carrot, literally and metaphorically."
Donna Meagle,It happens to everyone.
Donna Meagle,"It's not my favorite shirt, but it is my least favorite shirt."
Donna Meagle,It really does.
Donna Meagle,"Now, remember, it's about finding a dog that captures your spirit."
Donna Meagle,See?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,"If even one of you thinks about dryheaving in my car, you're all walking home."
Donna Meagle,This is mean.
Donna Meagle,Ann was right.
Donna Meagle,You know what?
Donna Meagle,You want us to memorize this whole script?
Donna Meagle,Park it.
Donna Meagle,Jerry Dinner
Donna Meagle,How about the new sushi place in Eagleton?
Donna Meagle,I hate that guy.
Donna Meagle,Game over.
Donna Meagle,This is Larry.
Donna Meagle,Wine is crying juice.
Donna Meagle,"Every time she calls, you answer."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,"Sorry to hear the news, Tom."
Donna Meagle,We're gonna miss you around the club.
Donna Meagle,'Cause Chris doesn't know.
Donna Meagle,I can only drink warm tap water with cayenne pepper.
Donna Meagle,You know what?
Donna Meagle,I'm on a cleanse.
Donna Meagle,Snitches get stitches.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, we can't use Facebook anymore?"
Donna Meagle,I'm out.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, and didn't Milton try to kiss you?"
Donna Meagle,This is Craig.
Donna Meagle,Don't.
Donna Meagle,"Over fine wines and cheeses, of course."
Donna Meagle,"All right, where to first?"
Donna Meagle,New shirt?
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, what'd you think they were doing?"
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,Then Ana asks Grey to punish her.
Donna Meagle,I just want to put you in a little cape and a little hat and just fly you around.
Donna Meagle,You're my little prince.
Donna Meagle,"There, there, baby boy."
Donna Meagle,"I love you, Tom."
Donna Meagle,I will have the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Veloci-Wrap.
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,You knew that one was a long shot.
Donna Meagle,"Honestly, this is perfect."
Donna Meagle,Take all the time you need.
Donna Meagle,I got a phone call.
Donna Meagle,They said he would lower taxes.
Donna Meagle,Are you going to hit that?
Donna Meagle,It's like the dog is the essence of Tom.
Donna Meagle,But it just is.
Donna Meagle,I think one of the mannequins tried to commit suicide.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, snap!"
Donna Meagle,This place is sad.
Donna Meagle,Who said anything about a boyfriend?
Donna Meagle,"For real, Tom."
Donna Meagle,Use him.
Donna Meagle,Abuse him.
Donna Meagle,Thank God.
Donna Meagle,There is some weird juju in this room right now.
Donna Meagle,Excuse me?
Donna Meagle,"No, thank you."
Donna Meagle,I will let him know.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Ben, you best watch yourself."
Donna Meagle,I want to meet your boy.
Donna Meagle,Shut up.
Donna Meagle,Where can I get lube that is healthy to eat?
Donna Meagle,Way better.
Donna Meagle,What is this in here? Saffron?
Donna Meagle,Not so fast.
Donna Meagle,"Plus, I would look good pulling into my owner's parking space in my Mercedes."
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,I like The Snakehole.
Donna Meagle,Maybe.
Donna Meagle,"Your share, mogul."
Donna Meagle,Thanks a lot.
Donna Meagle,"If you encounter this scenario, simply execute the following maneuver."
Donna Meagle,Don't even trip.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Tom."
Donna Meagle,Nice Taliban robes.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you tripping right now."
Donna Meagle,Way over asking price.
Donna Meagle,"Damn, this just heated up quick!"
Donna Meagle,"Well, they just came back with a new offer and jacked that shizz up."
Donna Meagle,"But if you see Jasmine, tell her she can keep Anthony, but I want my microwave back."
Donna Meagle,I can't go back there.
Donna Meagle,Not me.
Donna Meagle,No.
Donna Meagle,"How about, ""Yes, I am a hunter, and it's you season."""
Donna Meagle,That was that couple you liked at the open house.
Donna Meagle,Uh-uh.
Donna Meagle,Jerry's on the roof.
Donna Meagle,Tom's in the trunk.
Donna Meagle,Ann took a cab.
Donna Meagle,You'll probably never guess what kind of dog I am.
Donna Meagle,Hmm.
Donna Meagle,Thought we'd have some fun with our new boss.
Donna Meagle,Damn!
Donna Meagle,He is all right.
Donna Meagle,Why don't you hit that?
Donna Meagle,Maybe she's got him on hold.
Donna Meagle,You seemed a little uptight.
Donna Meagle,You're pranked.
Donna Meagle,Do you think everyone here is a grandfather?
Donna Meagle,Why don't we just turn up the pressure?
Donna Meagle,That way you don't have to put your mouth so close.
Donna Meagle,"That movie's 25 years old, Morris."
Donna Meagle,"And if you don't like how I tweet, don't follow me."
Donna Meagle,It's ketchup!
Donna Meagle,I'm live tweeting this dumbass conversation.
Donna Meagle,This is the best party I've ever been to.
Donna Meagle,"Ah, ah, ah, me first."
Donna Meagle,Me first.
Donna Meagle,Ben.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, why are you all dolled up?"
Donna Meagle,"All right, tear it up, 16!"
Donna Meagle,Emancipate them abs.
Donna Meagle,"Well, you look good, girl."
Donna Meagle,You're gonna turn somebody tonight.
Donna Meagle,And don't beat yourself up.
Donna Meagle,We're good.
Donna Meagle,What the [bleep]?
Donna Meagle,But I appreciate the effort.
Donna Meagle,Did you need me for something?
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,It really is.
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,"""Sorry about your jaw, son."""
Donna Meagle,Right in his face!
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,Game on.
Donna Meagle,"For cars, it's gold."
Donna Meagle,"For shoes, it's red unless it's the weekend, then reverse them."
Donna Meagle,"1970s funk and 1770s opera and Sugar Ray, post Mark McGrath after he left for Entertainment Tonight."
Donna Meagle,Downton Abbey.
Donna Meagle,Tommy.
Donna Meagle,It's a crazy twist.

Donna Meagle,Downtonâ¦ Abbey.
Donna Meagle,Read my Twitter feed.
Donna Meagle,It's blood lake.
Donna Meagle,"Get your foot out the water, dumbass!"
Donna Meagle,"Church, do the Harper's Magazine Acrostic, play my oboe in the jacuzzi while the sun sets over puget sound."
Donna Meagle,It's the death canoe.
Donna Meagle,Uhoh.
Donna Meagle,"Well, I feel sorry for the man."
Donna Meagle,"In order Natural Born Killers, Remains of the Day, and Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey."
Donna Meagle,Boo.
Donna Meagle,"No, it isn't."
Donna Meagle,"In the fifth one, the canoe's actually the hero."
Donna Meagle,Take the jacket.
Donna Meagle,It's about to get cold out there.
Donna Meagle,"Chris, you might want to take a jacket with you."
Donna Meagle,Maybe he fell into the toilet.
Donna Meagle,Remember when he fell into the toilet?
Donna Meagle,I think Ben's already filling the Leslie void.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,"Merry critches, bitches!"
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Donna Meagle,I drove here to take him to Jerry Dinner.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I already did something nice for Jerry."
Donna Meagle,Look like Blake Griffin.
Donna Meagle,"I'm talking about that jackedup, light skinned dude."
Donna Meagle,"Mm, look at that gingerbread man."
Donna Meagle,All right!
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,I know!
Donna Meagle,What is going on at the Gergiches?
Donna Meagle,I've still got a full week to go before the broth stage.
Donna Meagle,Whoa!
Donna Meagle,Good.
Donna Meagle,"See, he's acting all looseygoosey, but that little dude's wound so tight, he's gonna pop."
Donna Meagle,Are you serious?
Donna Meagle,Someone needs to be alert tonight.
Donna Meagle,Don't you want to be good people?
Donna Meagle,It's Christmas time.
Donna Meagle,We are going to pick up Jerry.
Donna Meagle,This Snake Juice is basically rat poison.
Donna Meagle,Everybody's wasted.
Donna Meagle,I feel so much healthier.
Donna Meagle,It doesn't look like him.
Donna Meagle,Do I look like I drink water?
Donna Meagle,I'm mad about your reasons.
Donna Meagle,"And you're fiercely loyal to your pack, which makes you a rare black Siberian husky."
Donna Meagle,"And when you stop baring your fangs to pick a mate, it's for life."
Donna Meagle,And I'm not just saying that.
Donna Meagle,I hope no one minds if I live tweet this bitch.
Donna Meagle,That's the best one!
Donna Meagle,Seriously?
Donna Meagle,"You do not obey, you choose to cooperate."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I am not the one on trial here."
Donna Meagle,You pride yourself on being a loner.
Donna Meagle,Potpourri?
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Donna Meagle,"You're beautiful, yet cold and aloof."
Donna Meagle,I'm not mad about the choice.
Donna Meagle,It's a nice basket.
Donna Meagle,"So, can I have the basket?"
Donna Meagle,We didn't prank you 'cause we don't respect you.
Donna Meagle,Uhuh.
Donna Meagle,We paid for an hour.
Donna Meagle,We did it 'cause we love you.
Donna Meagle,You gonna dig for an hour.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Aphrodite."
Donna Meagle,Chris needs you in his office.
Donna Meagle,I know.
Donna Meagle,I'll take it.
Donna Meagle,Thanks for the tip.
Donna Meagle,I bought three shares.
Donna Meagle,"""Pretty,"" ""makeup"" is that all you know about me?"
Donna Meagle,Lose him.
Donna Meagle,"Aye-aye, Captain."
Donna Meagle,Grammy Meagle taught me that.
Donna Meagle,Nice job Jerry.
Donna Meagle,"I usually get a 5% commission, but I'll do it for 3%."
Donna Meagle,I feel amazing.
Donna Meagle,"Eh, that's too far."
Donna Meagle,Whereabouts?
Donna Meagle,Nice.
Donna Meagle,"So, you boys are gonna go work out together, huh?"
Donna Meagle,Ho ho!
Donna Meagle,"Don't worry, I rolled down the window."
Donna Meagle,Friends and family discount.
Donna Meagle,One's waiting for me out in the car.
Donna Meagle,Respect.
Donna Meagle,Ron and I saw Jerry
Donna Meagle,Most def.
Donna Meagle,"That'll look legit next to those antique ""Visit France"" posters."
Donna Meagle,I have several men in rotation.
Donna Meagle,"Good use of the word fiscal, Tommy very upscale."
Donna Meagle,Eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs.
Donna Meagle,Check it.
Donna Meagle,"Craig! Craig, I got you, dog! Craig! Don't worry, I'm coming!"
Donna Meagle,And that's coming from someone who has a Mercedes.
Donna Meagle,Someone shot my car!
Donna Meagle,How are you doing?
Donna Meagle,I've done that to multiple men.
Donna Meagle,Back of my Benz?
Donna Meagle,That's it.
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Donna Meagle,Uh-uh.
Donna Meagle,Try to help.
Donna Meagle,"If you just leave them alone, I think we might get some offers."
Donna Meagle,This is yellowtail.
Donna Meagle,It is heating up in this piece.
Donna Meagle,To The Predator.
Donna Meagle,The Predator can see heat.
Donna Meagle,Did you hear that?
Donna Meagle,Bye.
Donna Meagle,With a Harman Kardon Logic surround sound system.
Donna Meagle,Is that a trick question?
Donna Meagle,"Hey, whatever happened to you and the Bionic Man?"
Donna Meagle,Now hush.
Donna Meagle,My baby has a delicate suspension.
Donna Meagle,That is so Andy.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, that means they like the place."
Donna Meagle,What are you wearing?
Donna Meagle,"The hell is wrong with you, Swanson?"
Donna Meagle,"You, mostly how you never let her vent because you're always too busy trying to solve everything for her."
Donna Meagle,He's in Liberia visiting my uncle.
Donna Meagle,What network is gonna buy a game show from you?
Donna Meagle,"""That sucks."""
Donna Meagle,"If you really want to unload that little horror cabin, you gonna need a professional to stage it properly."
Donna Meagle,"Lucky for you, I recently got my real estate license."
Donna Meagle,He wants to know what happened on Lost.
Donna Meagle,Spladow!
Donna Meagle,Holy cow.
Donna Meagle,I have no idea.
Donna Meagle,Split that commish
Donna Meagle,I'll split that commish.
Donna Meagle,I like it.

Donna Meagle,"Oh, I called him."
Donna Meagle,That is good stuff.
Donna Meagle,"She's complaining about everything, ruining whine & cheese club."

Donna Meagle,You're too accessible.
Donna Meagle,Nice work.
Donna Meagle,The new site looks good.
Donna Meagle,Here's what I saw go down.
Donna Meagle,Has to control everything.
Donna Meagle,"Mm, hard pass."
Donna Meagle,We're here because you need to tend to your woman.
Donna Meagle,No reason.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, you're right."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, do these phones dial out?"
Donna Meagle,"No, they're not."
Donna Meagle,Classic border collie.
Donna Meagle,You shot my Mercedes?
Donna Meagle,I like their candy fingernails.
Donna Meagle,absolutely nothing.
Donna Meagle,No.
Donna Meagle,Everything Sweetums makes is off the charts.
Donna Meagle,"No, I'm talking to my brother, George."
Donna Meagle,"Andy, you're fine, but you're simple."
Donna Meagle,Are you doing okay?
Donna Meagle,That's the Meagle motto.
Donna Meagle,It's my car.
Donna Meagle,"As someone who has lied a lot about various aspects of a myriad of relationships, I respect the effort you've gone to."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,I'ma let y'all have this one.
Donna Meagle,It's all right.
Donna Meagle,"Y'all broke up a long time ago, didn't you?"
Donna Meagle,Enough of this.
Donna Meagle,Nothing.
Donna Meagle,"Normally, people tell you to talk about your problems."
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I took your government computer from Indiana to Miami to sell it on the black market for 150 bucks."
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,"Mmm, I love breakfast cereal."
Donna Meagle,I was in Miami last weekend.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hello, lovers."
Donna Meagle,I'm going to recommend you bottle that noise up.
Donna Meagle,"I think he's a developer, wants to put in a luxury glampground."
Donna Meagle,"This was our chance to vent about work, and you've taken it over."
Donna Meagle,Why are we doing this?
Donna Meagle,"Glamping is ""glamour camping."""
Donna Meagle,"At first, this was funny, but it's gotten out of hand."
Donna Meagle,Cheers.
Donna Meagle,"Heated tents, catered meals, wifi"
Donna Meagle,Right on!
Donna Meagle,Yeah!
Donna Meagle,Mail's here.
Donna Meagle,Congrats.
Donna Meagle,It's very exciting.
Donna Meagle,"She died at the age of 84, sandwiched between two 30 year olds."
Donna Meagle,Let's call off the bet.
Donna Meagle,That sounds like an I.T. Problem.
Donna Meagle,I took my talents to South Beach.
Donna Meagle,"No, I'm not."
Donna Meagle,Call 311.
Donna Meagle,Move.
Donna Meagle,This is a Cuban.

Donna Meagle,I don't.
Donna Meagle,I don't know why.
Doug DeMarco,But it's impossible.
Doug DeMarco,How much money did we win?
Doug DeMarco,All right.
Doug DeMarco,"Okay, let's relive that day."
Doug DeMarco,"Well, I figured I could really tick off my parents by shacking up with some Pawnee trash."
Doug DeMarco,Leslie offered us each 200 bucks to keep this goingâ¦
Doug DeMarco,"Well, we never go to bed angry."
Doug DeMarco,Only this time could we shave her moustache?
Doug DeMarco,Ahh.
Doug DeMarco,Could I have a glass of water before we go on?
Doug DeMarco,She does this annoying thing where every time she takes a drink of water she is an old nag.
Doug DeMarco,Ahh.
Doug DeMarco,I slept with Sharon in 1979.
Dr. Harris,"Gonna take this, too."
Dr. Harris,Been meaning to read it.
Dr. Harris,"Nobody was drinking it, so I'm gonna take it."
Dr. Harris,I'm writing you a prescription for penicillin.
Dr. Harris,I'm gonna take this home.
Dr. Harris,"Look, you exercise a lot."
Dr. Harris,That sounds about right.
Dr. Harris,You're welcome.
Dr. Harris,"So, Andy, tell me what happened."
Dr. Harris,No.
Dr. Harris,The right.
Dr. Harris,It's really annoying when they ask questions.
Dr. Harris,Wish all patients were like that.
Dr. Harris,This isn't that fun.
Dr. Harris,You've got strep throat.
Dr. Harris,Hey.
Dr. Harris,I got it.
Dr. Harris,Yup.
Dr. Harris,Ann.
Dr. Harris,"It's a highly disgusting request, but I don't see why not."
Dr. Harris,Anything else bothering you?
Dr. Harris,"Well, I guess that explains it."
Dr. Harris,That's when they were scheduled to come off.
Dr. Harris,Gastrointestinal distress is common during a cardiac event.
Dr. Harris,Just making an observation.
Dr. Harris,You have very weak hands.
Dr. Harris,"Well, if it's a concussion it's extremely mild, so I wouldn't worry about it."
Dr. Harris,Not really.
Dr. Harris,He had a mild heart attack.
Dr. Harris,I was distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.
Dr. Harris,Easy!
Dr. Harris,What else?
Dr. Harris,"Yeah, they might be a little weak at first."
Dr. Harris,Forgot to look.
Dr. Harris,"Said it was personal, that he'd explain later, but then he never explained."
Dr. Harris,He rescheduled.
Dr. Harris,There's something occluding your ear.
Dr. Harris,I actually don't even know if he has mumps.
Dr. Harris,That man has the largest penis I have ever seen.
Dr. Harris,You're perfectly healthy.
Dr. Harris,Look to the left.
Dr. Harris,"Yeah, I'm gonna leave."
Dr. Harris,Okay.
Dr. Harris,Whatever.
Dr. Harris,Get a time machine.
Dr. Harris,"If he had his casts removed two weeks ago, the muscles wouldn't have atrophied so much."
Dr. Harris,Got a patient coming in.
Dr. Harris,Is this gonna take long?
Dr. Harris,"Well, they did cause it."
Dr. Harris,Mine's way bigger.
Dr. Harris,Go back to being 20.
Dr. Harris,"Well, the good news is this is just tendonitis."
Dr. Harris,Small office.
Dr. Harris,"Ann, Leslie."
Dr. Harris,Okay.
Dr. Harris,The other option was shoulder cancer.
Dr. Harris,Fortytwo.
Dr. Harris,"We'll set the fractures, and I'd like to keep him overnight for observation."
Dr. Harris,"Sure, I'll just advance medical science 30 years."
Dr. Harris,No.
Dr. Harris,Little things like this happen with men of your age.
Dr. Harris,You're in great shape.
Dr. Harris,Guy's got a spinal fracture.
Dr. Harris,"Well, not really."
Dr. Harris,Hi.
Dr. Harris,"So, Andy's doing well?"
Dr. Harris,Ooh.
Dr. Harris,The seats in my office are leather.
Dr. Harris,He's not going anywhere.
Dr. Harris,"Well, I can help you with the thumb."
Dr. Harris,And I'll have to give you referrals for specialists for the other thousand things.
Dr. Saperstein,"I'm so sorry, no."
Dr. Saperstein,You destroyed my family.
Dr. Saperstein,You know exactly why I'm doing this.
Dr. Saperstein,Just your luck that you're going into labor on Halloween.
Dr. Saperstein,I ask all my patients.
Dr. Saperstein,Can I get a warm towel to get that makeup off?
Dr. Saperstein,"According to my daughter, you broke her heart."
Dr. Saperstein,"It's what we doctors like to call, and I don't mean to be insensitive, a going out of business sale."
Dr. Saperstein,"No, you're not, 'cause look who's hiding over here."
Dr. Saperstein,Whatever blows your skirt up.
Dr. Saperstein,"Ha, a nightmare."
Dr. Saperstein,Let's see what's going down in baby town.
Dr. Saperstein,Okay.
Dr. Saperstein,You ready to push?
Dr. Saperstein,Can you imagine raising four children at one time?
Dr. Saperstein,Here comes a contraction.
Dr. Saperstein,Are you ready?
Dr. Saperstein,Deadly serious.
Dr. Saperstein,You tracked me down.
Dr. Saperstein,"Wow, you guys really dodged a bullet."
Dr. Saperstein,Just triplets.
Dr. Saperstein,It's a little fleck of cream cheese on the screen.
Dr. Saperstein,"Your body is going through some changes, but you're a healthy gal, right, Leslie?"
Dr. Saperstein,"Looks like your detective skills are a lot better than your tween, high end fashion rental skills."
Dr. Saperstein,All right.
Dr. Saperstein,There is no reason for you not to be yourself.
Dr. Saperstein,"I had to buy her a new one, so she could drive to Divinity School."
Dr. Saperstein,No? No go? Huh.
Dr. Saperstein,"Let me tell you something, mister."
Dr. Saperstein,And here's a fourth.
Dr. Saperstein,"Then I'm going to put it in an envelope, seal it, and when you're ready, voila."
Dr. Saperstein,"Someone say ""Saperstein""?"
Dr. Saperstein,"First, you screwed my son out of your business, and then you stole my daughter's virginity."
Dr. Saperstein,I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Dr. Saperstein,"You attack a Saperstein, you face my wrath."
Dr. Saperstein,I'm lovable.
Dr. Saperstein,What could you possibly need at 6:00 in the morning?
Dr. Saperstein,I'm gonna write it down.
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, how many times did he turn the paper over?"
Dr. Saperstein,"You know, I've got my hands full with my practice, my other businesses, my two terrible children."
Dr. Saperstein,"Oh, that is disappointing."
Dr. Saperstein,"All right, Ms. Ludgate."
Dr. Saperstein,Yes.
Dr. Saperstein,"Come on, you two."
Dr. Saperstein,"Leslie, I need you to be Buddha on quaaludes, and, Ben, you are Matthew McConaughey in a hammock on the beach."
Dr. Saperstein,Mmhmm.
Dr. Saperstein,This could be a superhero.
Dr. Saperstein,"So, look at this baby."
Dr. Saperstein,I don't think I have time to be mayor.
Dr. Saperstein,Your body is prone to releasing multiple eggs.
Dr. Saperstein,"Be so sure about this, Tiny Tom, that I will crush you like the bug you are And there it is, the heartbeat."
Dr. Saperstein,Wow.
Dr. Saperstein,There's your healthy baby.
Dr. Saperstein,It's easier.
Dr. Saperstein,We're getting close.
Dr. Saperstein,Give her some money.
Dr. Saperstein,"Oh, and there's another one."
Dr. Saperstein,Let's saddle you up and put some jelly on the belly.
Dr. Saperstein,Is it done?
Dr. Saperstein,"What a lovely offer, but I think not."
Dr. Saperstein,"The first thing you do is, you forget everything that I said before because you, young lady, need a lot of rest and especially avoiding stress."
Dr. Saperstein,Everything sounds perfect.
Dr. Saperstein,"So, do you want to know the sex?"
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, actually, one in 8,000."
Dr. Saperstein,Ben.
Dr. Saperstein,"Triplets occur a lot more frequently than you imagine, especially at your age."
Dr. Saperstein,That is the most symmetrical fetus I've ever seen.
Dr. Saperstein,Then you smashed up her BMW.
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, look at that, Mr. Haverford."
Dr. Saperstein,"Can you squeeze me in, or do I need a reservation? 'Cause there's nobody here."
Dr. Saperstein,Huh? Blow me a kiss.
Dr. Saperstein,I'm always looking for new investments.
Dr. Saperstein,Me too.
Dr. Saperstein,"No, no, I'm in as a partner."
Dr. Saperstein,You guys are just so neat.
Dr. Saperstein,I'm in.
Dr. Saperstein,"Would you be interested in adopting my children? They're in their late 20s, They're terrible."
Dr. Saperstein,"So all those postcards that you sent me, all those trophies that you'd won"
Dr. Saperstein,"Yes, we don't get along, but I look at you I see driven, I see smart, and I just had the best Italian meal I've ever had in my life, and I've been to Dallas."
Dr. Saperstein,I've got an auto dealership.
Dr. Saperstein,"Yes, this all started as vengeance for my children, but the company is making money now."
Dr. Saperstein,Thomas.
Dr. Saperstein,"I've got a massage parlor, a dry-cleaning transactional holding company that is doing unbelievably well, I might add."
Dr. Saperstein,"I'm gonna continue, and I'm gonna crush you! All right, you two, are you in for dinner tomorrow night?"
Dr. Saperstein,Wow! You're packed.
Dr. Saperstein,"Why would I back off just 'cause these nincompoops lie to me all the time? No, I'm not gonna back off."
Dr. Saperstein,"I love you too, angel."
Dr. Saperstein,I know this and I love you.
Dr. Saperstein,Give me 15 minutes.
Dr. Saperstein,Yeah.
Dr. Saperstein,These two have been huge disappointments to me.
Dr. Saperstein,"I will get dressed, we'll go down to my office."
Dr. Saperstein,"I came here to see your flourishing business, to see how well you're doing."
Dr. Saperstein,"Listen, I kind of remember, but I don't want to say anything that's wrong."
Dr. Saperstein,"Who's ready, raise your hand? It's a boy!"
Dr. Saperstein,Wow.
Dr. Saperstein,I'm watching cartoons with my son.
Dr. Saperstein,"So why, exactly, did you lie when I asked you what had happened?"
Dr. Saperstein,What do you say?
Dr. Saperstein,"No, I will not stop."
Dr. Saperstein,It looks like the chicken that wrote this had a stroke on the paper.
Drunk,Can you please go away?
Drunk,We don't--

Elise Yarktin,"Well, every year, we give it to a woman, and, frankly, nobody cares."
Elise Yarktin,No.
Elise Yarktin,"Yeah, the media has all but written us off as a niche interest group."
Elise Yarktin,"But if you give a women's award to a mustachioed, masculine man, such as yourself, well, then, eventually, people take notice."
Elise Yarktin,"Leslie, we were thrilled to find out you were boycotting that ridiculous Pie Mary."

Elise Yarktin,"Hi, Leslie."
Elise Yarktin,Look.
Elise Yarktin,"Congratulations, Ben Wyatt, you are this year's IOW Woman of the Year."

Evelyn Rowshlind,No!
Evelyn Rowshlind,He's not a monster.
Evelyn Rowshlind,He wants to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Now, Leslie, you did a great job, and the mayor knows that you did a great job."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Now, where is the possum?"

Grant Larson,The everyday minutia you would delegate to staff.
Grant Larson,"Leslie, your job is more creative, big picture stuff."
Grant Larson,"I mean, you're overseeing 200 people."
Grant Larson,"Well, you wouldn't actually be planting things."

Greg Pikitis,I don't know what you're talking about.
Greg Pikitis,What's that?
Greg Pikitis,"I mean, there's no way that two different people could have eaten the same fruit in the same day, in the same area of Indiana."
Greg Pikitis,"I screw with her 'cause she gets all riled up, and her face gets all scrunched up like this."
Greg Pikitis,Let's get out of here.
Greg Pikitis,But I like her.
Greg Pikitis,She's all right.
Greg Pikitis,"Thanks for stopping by, Leslie."
Greg Pikitis,You see?
Greg Pikitis,"You know, I like Knope."

Gretel,That's ridiculous.
Gretel,I've been eating lasagna and muffins every day of my life for 40 years and I feel terrible.
Gretel,"Now, why should the Bill of Rights be in the official time capsule, but this painting of my dog is in time capsule seven?"
Gretel,"There's a sign at Ramsett Park that says ""Do not drink the sprinkler water,"" so I made sun tea with it, and now I have an infection."
Gretel,What's so funny?
Gretel,Sir?
Gretel,"Sir, are Are you listening to me, sir?"
Gretel,"Sir, I'm talking to you!"
Gretel,Sir!
Gretel,"Sir, are you aware that there is waste in your water system?"
Gretel,Excuse me.

Harvey,"I take tents pretty seriously, Ben, I'm a tent guy."
Harvey,"Oh, hello, gentlemen."
Harvey,"I got over 1,300 tents in this warehouse alone."
Harvey,You wanna talk deal?
Harvey,"That's right, dickweed."
Harvey,80 dollars more.
Harvey,No doy.
Harvey,I liked it better the other way.
Harvey,Who's this little genie right here?
Harvey,Okay.
Harvey,Got your contracts for you right here.
Harvey,Because my prices have gone up ever so slightly since I saw you last.
Harvey,Yeah.
Harvey,"Keep your voice down, please, there's tents here."
Harvey,Whatever.
Harvey,I own every tent store in Southern Indiana.
Harvey,"Tent Town, Rent Ten Tents, the Tent Offensive, and Ace Tentura Tent Detective."
Harvey,"Yeah, we sure did."
Harvey,Okay.
Harvey,"I also own a chickfila franchise, but that's not doing so hot right now."
Harvey,Why don't we go ahead and sign that for me?
Harvey,Shh.
Harvey,You've reached the Tentagon.
Harvey,"How can I help you, buttface?"
Harvey,I think I know what I'm doing.
Harvey,So I added a few syllables and whatnot.
Harvey,"Clauses, et cetera."
Harvey,"Suit yourself, gentlemen."
Harvey,"Gentlemen, I've won two online satellite Jamaican poker tournaments."
Harvey,I can tell that you're bluffing.
Harvey,450 dollars.
Harvey,I am.
Harvey,And I was bluffing about winning those tournaments.
Harvey,"Gentlemen, clearly there's been a misunderstanding here."
Harvey,I'm hoping that we can reach some kind of a compromise.
Harvey,"Addendums, what have you."
Harvey,"Well, you need flaps, bro."
Harvey,"What are we up to, doll?"
Harvey,"Now, look, you can argue with me all you want, but for every line item that you two idiots disagree with, there's gonna be a 50 dollar discussion surcharge."
Harvey,A tent without flaps is basically a parachute.
Herb Scaifer,Organize It.
Herb Scaifer,"Hey, Ron!"
Herb Scaifer,Ooh.
Herb Scaifer,"Yeah, sure."
Herb Scaifer,"Well, please prepare yourself."
Herb Scaifer,"Well, sure you can Chris, you can keep it."
Herb Scaifer,I'd skip the first couple chapters if I were you.
Herb Scaifer,"When Zorp shows up, your faces will be melted off and used as fuel."
Herb Scaifer,"Between you and me, it doesn't really get good until Zorp shows up."
Herb Scaifer,I have terrible news.
Herb Scaifer,"Hey, they're beautiful."
Herb Scaifer,"Oh, I'm sorry, here's a check. You can cash that tomorrrow."
Herb Scaifer,Organize it 2: Engage with Zorp.
Herb Scaifer,Would you take a check?
Herb Scaifer,The world is going to end tomorrow at dawn.
Herb Scaifer,All the scholarly work that I did on these texts? Indicated that the world would end.
Herb Scaifer,Oh.
Herb Scaifer,"The entire planet, gone."
Herb Scaifer,Last call for doughnuts.
Herb Scaifer,And could you put aside ten tickets to that ice cream thing?
Herb Scaifer,"That of a fleshless, chattering skeleton when Zorp the surveyor arrives and burns your flesh off with his volcano mouth."
Herb Scaifer,Right at dawn.
Herb Scaifer,"Well, this morning at dawn, you will take a new form."
Herb Scaifer,Okay.
Herb Scaifer,Ah!
Herb Scaifer,"Frankly, Leslie, I'm shocked."
Herb Scaifer,And there are infinite forms we can take in infinite universes.
Herb Scaifer,"Dawn is nigh! Zorp the surveyor approaches, and all earthly debts will be repaid to the original source of life in the universe."
Herb Scaifer,May 19th.
Herb Scaifer,Afraid so.
Herb Scaifer,"Into the universe, we return."
Herb Scaifer,"Yes, well, the actual end of the world is six months from now."
Herb Scaifer,And I realized that I'd made some crucial errors
Herb Scaifer,"From the universe, we emerge."
Herb Scaifer,"Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?"
Herb Scaifer,"Yeah, but when the world did not end, I went home and began to reevaluate the texts."
Herb Scaifer,"Heh! Look here, I misspoke."
Herb Scaifer,"Yeah, it's May 20?"
Herb Scaifer,"If it makes you feel any better, Leslie, we'll all be dead in 20 minutes."
Herman,I've got a different idea for that land.
Herman,"Okay, you want the long needle or the short needle?"
Herman,Doesn't matter.
Herman,Can't find a short needle.
Herman,Long needle it is.
Herman,There is some beautiful jewelry in here.
Herman,You're gonna wanna look through the jewelry and nails tray.
Herman,"Sure, take a scoop out of the pill bucket."
Herman,"Okay, you said you wanted ""mouth queen""?"
Herman,Broke a window.
Herman,I call it Disneyland.
Herman,An amusement park with rides and food and sexy cartoon characters.
Herman,"No, that's my slogan idea."
Herman,I'll bid 30 bucks.
Herman,Fine.
Herman,50 and another win for old Herman.
Herman,I'm more of a Jack Johnson guy.
Herman,"If you want it so bad, bid on it."
Herman,"Oh, it's much better now."
Herman,She could watch me do belly flops then we maybe we could get some Thai food and a tank of nitrous and see what happens.
Herman,Nope.
Herman,My cousin's got a kickass mud pit in his yard.
Herman,But be careful.
Herman,Those are real nice.
Herman,Who even needs a slogan?
Herman,I like this store now.
Herman,The floor hole.
Herman,I am.
Herman,Say no more.
Herman,Here's a bunch of guns.
Herman,Looks like we've got ourselves an oldfashioned pawnshop waffle iron bidding war.
Herman,"Let's start the bidding at 650,000 dollars."
Herman,"I'll tell you what, Ann."
Herman,I'll give it to you if you go on a date with me.
Herman,Sold.
Herman,You still want to go out?
Herman,I just come into some money.
Herman,$500 buys a lot of nitrous.
Herman,Mm.
Herman,"And they were nipple rings, at one point."
Herman,Tattoos?
Herman,This is a pawnshop.
Herman,"But, yeah, sure, I can do that."
Herman,There's also nails.
Herman,I don't know.
Herman,"""Who even needs a slogan?"" And then a big picture of me flipping everybody off."
Herman,900 dollars.
Herman,700 dollars.
Herman,300 dollars.
Herman Lerpiss,I got something to say.
Herman Lerpiss,Why should we bail them out? No one bailed me out when I got arrested for arson.
Ian,"Oh, no."
Ian,Impossible.
Ian,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Ian,Just under the wire.
Ian,No way.
Ian Winston,I'm the girls' coach.
Ian Winston,I'm a man.
Ian Winston,Hi.
Ian Winston,Leslie said I should come over here.
Ian Winston,Yeah.
Ian Winston,She's the boys' coach.
Ian Winston,It kind of is.
Ian Winston,We were here first.
Ian Winston,You promised the girls a field by the end of this week.
Ingrid de Forest,He's just being a good neighbor.
Ingrid de Forest,"We're in a lot of trouble, Leslie."
Ingrid de Forest,I have a PhD from the Sorbonne.
Ingrid de Forest,"There was a fashion component, yes."
Ingrid de Forest,"Leslie, I just wanna borrow your husband for the evening."
Ingrid de Forest,Please.
Ingrid de Forest,Could I take you out for a celebratory plate of-- I think you call them waffles?
Ingrid de Forest,Yuck.
Ingrid de Forest,"And if I do win, I'm gonna have very big roller skates to fill."
Ingrid de Forest,"It was incredibly courageous, and it was selfless."
Ingrid de Forest,The filibuster.
Ingrid de Forest,Not the forceful urination.
Ingrid de Forest,"I know you must hate me right now, Leslie, and that's justified, but I need to thank you for what you just did in there."
Ingrid de Forest,"Hi, Leslie."
Ingrid de Forest,"Ooh, gosh."
Ingrid de Forest,"These are made of Swarovski crystal, and they're worth 700,000 dollars."
Ingrid de Forest,"Of course, it's silly to compare apples and oranges, but what the heck."
Ingrid de Forest,"If you win, Eagleton will give you this basket of oranges."
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, Leslie, I think we had similar ideas."
Ingrid de Forest,Yeah.
Ingrid de Forest,And thank you.
Ingrid de Forest,We really appreciate your help.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, now you're just being nasty."
Ingrid de Forest,No.
Ingrid de Forest,I'm so sorry we're late.
Ingrid de Forest,We came from our bankruptcy brunch.
Ingrid de Forest,"And Michael Buble played, but he ran a little long."
Ingrid de Forest,"Sure, let's not have brunch like animals."
Ingrid de Forest,Total body hydration.
Ingrid de Forest,"Ah, yes."
Ingrid de Forest,Goodbye Goodbye Nah.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, yes."
Ingrid de Forest,Yes.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, most of our files are in these boxes if you really wanna take a look at how much that we've spent."
Ingrid de Forest,We find a little gauche.
Ingrid de Forest,We don't really like to talk about money.
Ingrid de Forest,We purchased HBO for the whole town.
Ingrid de Forest,It's not TV.
Ingrid de Forest,Great.
Ingrid de Forest,Do you have a plan that will help us or not?
Ingrid de Forest,We have borrowed absolutely everything we can from the state.
Ingrid de Forest,"And really, Pawnee is our only hope."
Ingrid de Forest,"I understand that our towns have a complicated history, but we have a saying in Eagleton ""You don't kick a dressage horse after a failed pas de deux."""
Ingrid de Forest,You didn't actually help us at all.
Ingrid de Forest,Leslie?
Ingrid de Forest,"First of all, Eagleton has no money."
Ingrid de Forest,"If it makes any difference, your work here was a real inspiration to me, and I am going to do my best to continue your legacy."
Ingrid de Forest,"It's like what Sir Ian McKellen said to me the day I sold my boat to Karl Lagerfeld, ""Parting is such sweet sorrow."""
Ingrid de Forest,This must be hard for you.
Ingrid de Forest,"But, would you like to?"
Ingrid de Forest,I studied opera at the Sorbonne.
Ingrid de Forest,I'd be happy to harmonize.
Ingrid de Forest,But this is nice too.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, technically, my home away from home is in Zurich."
Ingrid de Forest,"Bertram, that's enough."
Ingrid de Forest,"Ew, pesticide."
Ingrid de Forest,#NAME?
Ingrid de Forest,"Second of all, they are gracious enough to throw us a lifeline, and we should be eternally grateful for their generosity."
Ingrid de Forest,"They're a town of angels-- greasy, denim-clad angels, but angels nonetheless."
Ingrid de Forest,"Thank you, Leslie, from all of us in Eagleton."
Ingrid de Forest,Our citizens owe you a debt of gratitude.
Ingrid de Forest,"On the bright side, we did win the basketball game."
Ingrid de Forest,I think you owe us some apples.
Ingrid de Forest,#NAME?
Ivy Lewis,Can we turn you into a princess?

JJ,"The whole neighborhood would have to suddenly become safe and clean, and have businesses and people who dine out."
JJ,Everything would have to magically change.
JJ,"No, actually, you're my favorite."
JJ,"You spent over 1,000 dollars last year on waffles alone."
JJ,"Oh, no."
JJ,Anything for my favorite customer.
JJ,Sure.
JJ,"Yeah, I heard you were bringing that back."
JJ,What can I get you guys?
JJ,"Well, I agree with you."
JJ,But the guy who bought the property didn't even give me a chance to re-up the lease.
JJ,Can't win 'em all.
JJ,What?
JJ,Is something wrong?
JJ,We followed your instructions.
JJ,"Okay, but I don't know how anybody would know it's you."
JJ,The last ten were still in the shell.
JJ,"Look, I appreciate everything that you guys have done for me, but even if I put in the time and the money to refurbish this trash heap, it's not gonna change the fact that no respectable people live in this part of town anymore."
JJ,"What can I get you, Ann?"
JJ,Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.
JJ,51 eggs in 20 minutes.
JJ,It was a company with a weird sounding name.
JJ,Hang on.
JJ,Here it is.
JJ,"""Thigh Gap, LLC Owner, Dennis Feinstein."""
JJ,I'm sending home some free waffles for Leslie.
JJ,That's not true.
JJ,Dry toast and half a grapefruit for Chris.
JJ,Egg whites for Ben.
JJ,And don't you go sneaking off.
JJ,"Egg whites for Tom, and pretty much everything we make for Ron."
Jack Cooper,We've received this letter from a collection agency about an outstanding debt from the Pawnee Public Library.
Jack Cooper,Got a second?
Jack Cooper,Ron?
Jack Cooper,"It's not the size of the boat, embracing Life with a Micropenis."
Jack Cooper,"Jack Cooper, from the Controller's Office."

Jack Cooper,It appears you have an overdue book.
Janine Restrepo,Not good enough?
Janine Restrepo,Have we ever met?
Janine Restrepo,"Yeah, I got that."
Janine Restrepo,"Okay, well, call my secretary, and maybe we can set something up for next month."
Janine Restrepo,Okay.
Janine Restrepo,All right.
Janine Restrepo,Uh-huh.
Janine Restrepo,Call my secretary and we'll set it up.
Janine Restrepo,"Well, my schedule is my schedule."
Janine Restrepo,"So, I'm just gonna get back to my dessert."
Janine Restrepo,Excuse me?
Janine Restrepo,Leave.
Janine Restrepo,Mmm-hmm.
Janine Restrepo,Hi.
Janine Restrepo,What do you want?
Janine Restrepo,Get out.
Janine Restrepo,Bye.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Will you do me one final kindness?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Will you pretend to be my wife for an insurance scam, but then we fall in love for real?"

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you have the insurance money?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,For truth?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I am going to miss you so much.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll give you ten minutes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let me get a shot at it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tommy, I will always be there for you, no matter what, but right now, I cannot be there for you because I have to go."

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"For real, T.T., think about it man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come over here.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Also, can I have a pair of your gym socks?"

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm gonna have a short, honest conversation with my father."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You come here often?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"um, I think we do."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When she turned 30, he was like, ""Get out!"""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Shut it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,He didn't even have one.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You want to talk about spreading and sheets, we can go back to my place and I will rock your--"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That makes sense.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,So I just go out the same way I came in?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Did someone call for a party zoo?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I like your energy, hombre."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What do you say you and I ride gokarts later?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Deal.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You gots to stop by.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,The only reason I wouldn't be there is if I got pulled over... For violating my house arrest. Ahboosh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Judge gave me two ankle bracelets, said it was the first time he ever had to do that."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uh, jah boy's a question on the bar exam."

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That is so oh, you know what?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You see, my resume might not actually be accurate, right? So I have no idea what you're talking about."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Don't know what Quickbooks are.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no, no, Barney, come on."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,But you don't have to be an accountant to know that this girl is a ten.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, this may be it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I actually told him that RentASwag was my idea and that you had stole it from me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Because my dad is always riding me for never having a job, and I just didn't want to show that I blew it again."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hmm.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That's probably not relevant, though."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hmm.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Not it!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Ooh, you got me!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Whoa ho!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yo, what up, D.S?"

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yes!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm gonna be an uncle?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Mwah!

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I love you, daddy!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Lemony snicket.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no, that's too much too much responsibility for me."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm actually getting dinner with my dad right now.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Please tell me that you're dumping my sister, because I will laugh I will laugh so much."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Either my best friend emerges triumphant, or my dad beats you, and I get all that money when he dies."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That's what I'm talking about! And for me, it's a win-win either way."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You're basically Babyface!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When Babyface was your age, he hadn't even signed Toni Braxton yet, let alone Usher."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Second of all, what are you talking about, man? You're Tommy Haverford! You're an idea man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I doubt it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"He never gives up on anything, except for my mom."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You want to come?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hibbert, Hibbert."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I gotta I gotta find another way out of this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why are we here?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"He gave me every opportunity to jump in at the ground floor, and I said no, not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because-- and this is very important-- I really didn't care about what was happening."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No way, The Closer?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Oof!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Craig, we're gonna drink."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Congratulations.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You dodged a bullet, baby."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She's the worst.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm just kidding, man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Nah!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Daddy-D! Daddy, come on, I lie to you all the time! All those math camps I said I went to? I don't even know what a math camp is!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Trophies I bought
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What the hell is wrong with you, man?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's hilarious
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, that was hilarious"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You had a dumdum face.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Come on, you love us."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tell me you love us, and then admit this guy looks like Beaker from the Muppets."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Is that your real name?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's my sister.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Ooh, she got a mouth on her also."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you know what I love?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm gonna tell you something that I once heard from a very, very smart woman named Kim."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Why don't you use that time and go after one of your passions, like model trains or, like, or toy Gandalfs or something?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,True or false?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"So at this accounting firm, you would have the boring job? Are you nuts? This is probably the first time you've had off since you've been kid president."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You would be an accountant For accountants?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let me get this straight.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I almost fell asleep during that sentence.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Take me there.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,If you don't mind.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Throw my name, I get a referral discount."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When she rips it off, she smiles, and it makes you feel things."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Her name is Kim.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"By the way, there's a woman over there that is unbelievable."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Getting a Brazilian.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"It's going good, I'm actually right here for an appointmt."

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, you could do better than that."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'ma help you out right now.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Angelo, thank you so much for coming out."

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Makes your head look like a fish.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Who are you?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Secondly, I don't know where the paperwork is, but when you find it, can you take care of it for us?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Lastly, I hate the name, Angelo."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'ma switch it up for you, right now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Your new nickname is Jello shot.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What do you think of that, Jshot?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you have questions?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ben?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hit it!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We don't have any pens 'cause we're afraid it's gonna leak in our shirts.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,BbbbBenjammin'!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"My question to you is, how you making that paper?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"First of all, unbelievable analogy."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,So I'ma throw up.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When life gives you lemons, you sell some of your grandma's jewelry, and you go clubbing."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"It's like I always say, okay?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"And those guys are giving out free pizza with ""papperonas."""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You see there's a better version of your store across the street?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tommy Pickles!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I ate too much cheese.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Thank you so much.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I can't wait.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hey, hey."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll talk to you!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We bought a printing press.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That is so weird.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,My dad said that?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hold up.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you wanna know how we make money?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Are we calling everybody ""baby"" now?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"'Cause honestly, I love that."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Aww, Snapple."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Aww!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This prints bills with our faces and the e720 logo on them.
Jen,Nothing.
Jen,I just needed a college credit.
Jen,My parents.
Jen,"Well, my mom's the devil and my dad's a dumb doctor."
Jen,Yeah.
Jen,The only thing I love more than parks is recreation.
Jen,College is stupid.
Jen,Thanks.
Jen,No.
Jen,Maybe you're right.
Jen,Okay.
Jen,Texting.
Jen,A scary mermaid that lures sailors to their death.
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry about all these papers.
Jennifer Barkley,I'll give you Joe Biden's home phone number.
Jennifer Barkley,How about this why don't I make you guys a deal?
Jennifer Barkley,"I mean, the only potential problem is that devastatingly nerdy Cones of Dunshire thing."
Jennifer Barkley,Mmm.
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope.
Jennifer Barkley,Hi.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm Jen Barkley.
Jennifer Barkley,Hi.
Jennifer Barkley,"After a rough start, your girl's doing okay."
Jennifer Barkley,""" Then he offered me a crazy amount of money."
Jennifer Barkley,There's no way.
Jennifer Barkley,"Now I am not saying that Leslie Knope is a dog murderer, per se, I just think that her actions raise some questions."
Jennifer Barkley,"Like, for example, is she a dog murderer?"
Jennifer Barkley,"Say your goodbyes, Pebble 'Cause ""Weswie"" Knope gonna kill you."
Jennifer Barkley,Your son is a moron.
Jennifer Barkley,"So I was, like, ""sorry, Nick."""
Jennifer Barkley,"Apparently, Leslie Knope wielded her insider influence and got Councilman Pillner to save her precious department, even though it meant closing the shelter."
Jennifer Barkley,I shouldn't even tell you how much.
Jennifer Barkley,"$250,000.00 "
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, that was great."
Jennifer Barkley,"No, but there's a supply room over there with a futon."
Jennifer Barkley,Not yet.
Jennifer Barkley,Just wait we're just getting supplies.
Jennifer Barkley,Anybody need anything?
Jennifer Barkley,"Pushpins okay, good."
Jennifer Barkley,Colquitt is not going to run again.
Jennifer Barkley,"It's a rumor for now, but my gut says it's for real."
Jennifer Barkley,But I will.
Jennifer Barkley,You're the perfect candidate.
Jennifer Barkley,I just want to go home.
Jennifer Barkley,She's off her game.
Jennifer Barkley,Terrence!
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, mmhmm."
Jennifer Barkley,"Plus frankly, I needed a break from Washington."
Jennifer Barkley,I know.
Jennifer Barkley,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Jennifer Barkley,"Local hero, state government experience."
Jennifer Barkley,Great.
Jennifer Barkley,"I'd never heard of Bobby Newport before, but it became clear in two seconds this guy is a moron."
Jennifer Barkley,Grab a seat.
Jennifer Barkley,"Does that guy Chris Traeger have a girlfriend, and is his penis normal?"
Jennifer Barkley,"And Leslie, your Parks work, it's no joke."
Jennifer Barkley,"Ben, it's a great job on this campaign."
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, I've been reading up on you two."
Jennifer Barkley,Eh.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm leaving.
Jennifer Barkley,He seems really busy.
Jennifer Barkley,Didn't get a chance to say good-bye to Chris.
Jennifer Barkley,That doesn't matter.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anyway, would you tell him I said good-bye? Great! Thank you."
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry we didn't get a chance to meet.
Jennifer Barkley,This is time sensitive.
Jennifer Barkley,Need the congressman.
Jennifer Barkley,Move.
Jennifer Barkley,Oh.
Jennifer Barkley,I had them shipped in.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm a news junkie.
Jennifer Barkley,I really want to get out of here.
Jennifer Barkley,This is federal government caliber.
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Jennifer Barkley,That probably pulled her even with Bobby.
Jennifer Barkley,That is great news.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm going to see you in D.C.
Jennifer Barkley,Please don't do this.
Jennifer Barkley,Just concede.
Jennifer Barkley,It's over.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, come on."
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm dead serious, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, we're gonna win the debate."
Jennifer Barkley,Got an ace in the hole.
Jennifer Barkley,Little surpriseywisey.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, you'll see."
Jennifer Barkley,"Hey, quick question."
Jennifer Barkley,Bobby Newport's daddy called me out of the blue.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm everywhere.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, damn it."
Jennifer Barkley,You want to be governor of Indiana?
Jennifer Barkley,I think you should run for the House of Representatives.
Jennifer Barkley,It's a win win.
Jennifer Barkley,"Great work, all of you!"
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?"
Jennifer Barkley,This is a home run for us! We're gonna dominate the news cycle for a whole week.
Jennifer Barkley,You've gotta have an angle.
Jennifer Barkley,I wasn't born yesterday.
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, what's in it for you?"
Jennifer Barkley,Uh-oh.
Jennifer Barkley,You look serious.
Jennifer Barkley,Ben bought one hour of my time.
Jennifer Barkley,I heard you need some consulting.
Jennifer Barkley,What's on the agenda?
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, I get paid $1,200 an hour."
Jennifer Barkley,Do you really want to spend any of that time talking about my mother and her 19-year-old Korean husband?
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, getting a chair."
Jennifer Barkley,Everything in this town is so cheap.
Jennifer Barkley,It's on me.
Jennifer Barkley,Anything?
Jennifer Barkley,Whoo!
Jennifer Barkley,You want anything?
Jennifer Barkley,That's an exit.
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie.
Jennifer Barkley,"Ramps, lifts, your plan, my plan I don't actually care about any of this."
Jennifer Barkley,The fact is I don't care.
Jennifer Barkley,"Yes, Ben, I am talking about, like, jobwise."
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, I don't doubt it."
Jennifer Barkley,Mm.
Jennifer Barkley,Let's talk about what you're gonna do next.
Jennifer Barkley,Blah blah blah.
Jennifer Barkley,Great job.
Jennifer Barkley,We won.
Jennifer Barkley,"Yeah, yeah, this one's over."
Jennifer Barkley,Was somebody just talking about Bobby Newport's plan?
Jennifer Barkley,Tell me why.
Jennifer Barkley,Because Ned Jones and I would love to share it with you.
Jennifer Barkley,I sense that you're angry.
Jennifer Barkley,"Come on out here, Ned."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm just kidding.
Jennifer Barkley,Who was that?
Jennifer Barkley,"Gone, but never forgotten."
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, what's to stop me from just paying for the shelter and still running the ads?"
Jennifer Barkley,Ridiculous.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,"Sex was pretty good, thanks to me."
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, Pawnee has done you a favor."
Jennifer Barkley,You've outgrown them.
Jennifer Barkley,"You've got talent, you've got name recognition, which means that you have a bright, wide-open future with a thousand options."
Jennifer Barkley,"State Senate, federal jobs, even Congress, all of these are doable for you."
Jennifer Barkley,And you can trust me.
Jennifer Barkley,Because I don't care enough about you to lie.
Jennifer Barkley,"Uh-oh, time's up Okay, if you want to keep talking, you're going to have to pay me 1,200 more dollars."
Jennifer Barkley,"I swear to God, if you say one more word, you will legally owe me 1200 dollars, and I will sue you."
Jennifer Barkley,Let's not end it like that.
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, great to see you, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,Those five words are on me.
Jennifer Barkley,Wow.
Jennifer Barkley,Should I move this back? Don't answer that.
Jennifer Barkley,Give him a hand.
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport thinks that the stairs should do the work for you, don't you agree?"
Jennifer Barkley,"Now you could use a ramp, but that seems like a lot of work."
Jennifer Barkley,"Yeah, Mr. Baker."
Jennifer Barkley,"Be the woman who moves away climbs the ladder, and then confidently comes and has sex with her hot old English teacher just for kicks."
Jennifer Barkley,"Don't be the kid that graduates high school, hangs out in the school parking lot."
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, you love this town, it's being run by monsters and morons? Get a better job, rise above their heads, affect change at a higher level."
Jennifer Barkley,"No, that's that's, um that is a great idea."
Jennifer Barkley,"In fact, I don't know why I hadn't thought of it already."
Jennifer Barkley,Of course he does.
Jennifer Barkley,Damn it.
Jennifer Barkley,Good to see you.
Jennifer Barkley,"Hi, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,It's a terrible idea.
Jennifer Barkley,Damn it! I swear the air in this town is killing my brain cells.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm just trying to win.
Jennifer Barkley,"First of all, you could lose to a guy like that."
Jennifer Barkley,Okay.
Jennifer Barkley,"Now, you might win."
Jennifer Barkley,"You're smart, Ben is smart, you might win."
Jennifer Barkley,But why would you want to?
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport's plan is called ""Rise Up!"
Jennifer Barkley,Pawnee.
Jennifer Barkley,""" He is going to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town."
Jennifer Barkley,Then dream bigger.
Jennifer Barkley,"I should know, those terrible people have paid me so much money, I have a condo on every Virgin Island."
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, it's not personal."
Jennifer Barkley,I like you.
Jennifer Barkley,But my job is to beat you.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, man."
Jennifer Barkley,I knew I shouldn't have met you guys.
Jennifer Barkley,Let's get back on track.
Jennifer Barkley,Now I kind of hope you win.
Jennifer Barkley,This is why Ned Jones has endorsed us.
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport cares about better, not cheaper for our seniors."
Jennifer Barkley,"There she goes again, Perd."
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, Perd, Leslie Knope represents everything that is wrong about politics in America."
Jennifer Barkley,"She's naive, she's untested, and she's an entrenched bureaucrat that's got the stink of big government all over her."
Jennifer Barkley,"The fact is, Bobby Newport's plan is better for seniors, better for Pawnee."
Jennifer Barkley,This is politics as usual.
Jennifer Barkley,So I guess we both agree.
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope is wrong for Pawnee.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, Perd."
Jennifer Barkley,I bought them one.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, it does now."
Jennifer Barkley,"Gracias, Marta."
Jennifer Barkley,I just think our opposition is losing sight of what all this is about.
Jennifer Barkley,You can do better than Joe.
Jennifer Barkley,Excuse me?
Jennifer Barkley,Bobby Newport's personal life is neither here nor there.
Jennifer Barkley,"If he puts two sentences together without crying, the press is going to say he's doing surprisingly well, and if he falls to pieces, he's going to look sympathetic."
Jennifer Barkley,Expectations are crazy low.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, he'll be fine."
Jennifer Barkley,I already took care of the bill.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anyway, enjoy your dinner, guys."
Jennifer Barkley,That will backfire.
Jennifer Barkley,Don't challenge me on that.
Jennifer Barkley,That was mostly made-up.
Jennifer Barkley,"All right, that could work."
Jennifer Barkley,"What are you talking about? Oh, that thing I said on the show? Oh, no."
Jennifer Barkley,That was really fun.
Jennifer Barkley,You really stepped up your game.
Jennifer Barkley,"Hi, guys."
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, trust me."
Jennifer Barkley,Thank you.
Jennifer Barkley,I didn't realize that you were pro landmine.
Jennifer Barkley,And that woman that he is with is an anti landmine advocate.
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, we were going to keep this a secret until we had everything in writing, but Bobby Newport is trying to convince a major European company to open up a factory in Pawnee."
Jennifer Barkley,You almost got me.
Jennifer Barkley,So do you have any idea how long this is going to take?
Jennifer Barkley,Maybe a free shuttle service for seniors.
Jennifer Barkley,Come up with something better.
Jennifer Barkley,You didn't have to.
Jennifer Barkley,"The point is just yesterday you said to me, ""I'm never happier than when I'm managing a campaign."""
Jennifer Barkley,"You're going to go on that perm show again, so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea was yours."
Jennifer Barkley,"Um, you're going to attack me."
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, let me guess."
Jennifer Barkley,Feelings and girlfriend and whatever.
Jennifer Barkley,So what's Ben's next move for you?
Jennifer Barkley,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it."
Jennifer Barkley,Never seen anyone more tortured over good news.
Jennifer Barkley,"Governor Scott might be vulnerable, but you have very little name recognition."
Jennifer Barkley,"Frankly, your path to victory is narrow."
Jennifer Barkley,Why not?
Jennifer Barkley,"Mr. Kurtzwilder, it might be helpful if you told us why you want to be governor of Florida."
Jennifer Barkley,I know.
Jennifer Barkley,It's my job to know.
Jennifer Barkley,I'll get you some of those waffles you love.
Jennifer Barkley,So have a seat.
Jennifer Barkley,I watched you in Florida.
Jennifer Barkley,You were saying it with your heart.
Jennifer Barkley,"Yes, I am."
Jennifer Barkley,That's not a terrible idea.
Jennifer Barkley,You need to beat our idea.
Jennifer Barkley,"No, but that would backfire because then we would just say, ""you can never spend too much on seniors."""
Jennifer Barkley,You could attack the Newport plan for costing too much money.
Jennifer Barkley,"If you love chess, which I do, but you don't have anybody to play against, which I don't, then sometimes, you just gotta play yourself."
Jennifer Barkley,"Ah, what the hell."
Jennifer Barkley,"So, just take tonight and just think about your future."
Jennifer Barkley,I really shouldn't give you campaign advice.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,I don't know.
Jennifer Barkley,"But you, Ben Wyatt, are one of them."
Jennifer Barkley,"Mmhmm, okay."
Jennifer Barkley,They care about whose idea was best.
Jennifer Barkley,They don't care about whose idea was first.
Jennifer Barkley,"But more importantly, so are you."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm amazing.
Jennifer Barkley,Because you know what people don't care about?
Jennifer Barkley,"Which I did, everyone's going to think you're a sore loser, a goodygoody nerd."
Jennifer Barkley,"No, actually, it is kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that I stole your idea"
Jennifer Barkley,There aren't a lot of people that can manage a campaign.
Jennifer Barkley,Great.
Jennifer Barkley,You might be over qualified.
Jennifer Barkley,Okay?
Jennifer Barkley,Aah!
Jennifer Barkley,I feel like he's dying all over again.
Jennifer Barkley,"So I I hate to bring this up again, but I just want to make sure that I'm going to get paid."
Jennifer Barkley,It was a handshake agreement with Mr.
Jennifer Barkley,Newport.
Jennifer Barkley,It was for a lot of money.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anyway, you can wiretransfer it."
Jennifer Barkley,Oh!
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry for your loss.
Jennifer Barkley,"You were going to use us, and we just turned the tables on you."
Jennifer Barkley,'Cause I'm smarter and faster.
Jennifer Barkley,That is not a judgment.
Jennifer Barkley,That's just a fact.
Jennifer Barkley,"We're both just doing whatever it takes to win, right?"
Jennifer Barkley,I love polka dots.
Jennifer Barkley,It's so cute.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, come on, you guys were only going to apologize for the press."
Jennifer Barkley,Just oh!
Jennifer Barkley,Just when we thought she couldn't stoop any lower.
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope is driving her campaign bus through a memorial service.
Jennifer Barkley,Might not.
Jennifer Barkley,Probably will.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm being serious, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,You want to do it?
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, you never do know, though, right?"
Jennifer Barkley,"So, just let me know what you want to do."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm just going to spend my time doing exactly what I want to do.
Jennifer Barkley,Because I don't have children.
Jennifer Barkley,"Bye, guys."
Jennifer Barkley,I need someone to coordinate out of D.C.
Jennifer Barkley,Puttin' up a new scarecrow?
Jennifer Barkley,"Ohio, 19."
Jennifer Barkley,Where do you have to go?
Jennifer Barkley,"You guys live in Pawnee, Indiana."
Jennifer Barkley,This is a time of solemnity and remembrance.
Jennifer Barkley,"This is not a time for politic Oh, wow."
Jennifer Barkley,My life is amazing.
Jennifer Barkley,Sure.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm running congressman Murray's reelection bid.
Jennifer Barkley,Ugh!
Jennifer Barkley,Just say you're sorry.
Jennifer Barkley,Doesn't matter.
Jennifer Barkley,Done.
Jennifer Barkley,Look.
Jennifer Barkley,"Just ignore the fact that you're right, put on your blandest outfit-- So that one, hopefully, and then just go out there and publicly apologize."
Jennifer Barkley,"Come on, you guys, you know the drill."
Jennifer Barkley,"She calls it ""goose bump prevention."""
Jennifer Barkley,"Anything else would be a classless move, on par with spraypainting nipples on the Lincoln memorial."
Jennifer Barkley,"She started an awareness campaign called ""Bring a Sweater."""
Jennifer Barkley,"You really stepped in it this time, Knope."
Jennifer Barkley,What's that horrible sound?
Jennifer Barkley,"Your opponent is legendarily stupid and I phoned it in pretty hard, but you have a knack for this."
Jennifer Barkley,Oof.
Jennifer Barkley,My partners back in Washington think so too.
Jennifer Barkley,I need you in Washington in two days.
Jennifer Barkley,"Hey, you did an unbelievable job on this campaign, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,Because June Hartwell is a lukewarm bowl of nothing.
Jennifer Barkley,I am calling on Leslie Knope to cancel all of her campaign events out of respect for the Newport family.
Jennifer Barkley,This is not a time for politics.
Jennifer Barkley,It's like taking a shot of tequila.
Jennifer Barkley,We need to go over the schedule leading up to the primary.
Jennifer Barkley,Let's talk shop.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, because every surface area in your house is sticky."
Jennifer Barkley,"Last time I was here, I found a melted crayon on my blazer."
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, excuse me, but I have to get back to a city, where things happen."
Jennifer Barkley,Okay.
Jennifer Barkley,This campaign is about to start in earnest.
Jennifer Barkley,Things are about to get real intense.
Jennifer Barkley,"Leslie, you ready?"
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Jennifer Barkley,"Mmm, see, that's the problem."
Jennifer Barkley,Being the wife of is a minefield.
Jennifer Barkley,"If you were just a dingdong, I would just slap a flag pin on you, and pour some Valium down your throat, and just shove you behind the podium way upstage."
Jennifer Barkley,It's the smarties that freak people out.
Jennifer Barkley,I don't think that is possible.
Jennifer Barkley,Poncho!
Jennifer Barkley,"You just gotta force it down, suddenly the world feels so much more pleasant."
Jennifer Barkley,Your life is gross.
Jennifer Barkley,I do three shots every time I have to enter this house.
Jennifer Barkley,Give me your answer soon.
Jennifer Barkley,"Chris, right? Hi, I'm Jen."
Jennifer Barkley,"Paul Hartwell, who is your congressional incumbent from this district, is a moron."
Jennifer Barkley,"Haven't got all day, honey."
Jennifer Barkley,Great! Let's do it.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm very good at it.
Jennifer Barkley,It's just sex.
Jennifer Barkley,Might derail your career.
Jennifer Barkley,My job is done and so is yours.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,This campaign is over.
Jennifer Barkley,There you are.
Jennifer Barkley,Surprise.
Jennifer Barkley,Surprise.
Jennifer Barkley,Whoa!
Jennifer Barkley,What do you say?
Jennifer Barkley,You guys should have corner boothed it because you look awful.
Jennifer Barkley,You're gonna scare off the other customers.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, for God's sake, Chris."
Jennifer Barkley,Even by Washington standards.
Jennifer Barkley,Shouldn't we be rewarding our citizens for voting?
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,Whoa!
Jennifer Barkley,"That was fun last night, you old screamer."
Jennifer Barkley,What was that?
Jennifer Barkley,That was huge.
Jennifer Barkley,But he wins every year because he's a horrible bully and nobody opposes him.
Jennifer Barkley,Till now.
Jennifer Barkley,What are you doing here?
Jennifer Barkley,Hey.
Jennifer Barkley,"We're talking about the House of Representatives, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,"Hartwell's biggest weakness is the economy, which is your exact strength."
Jennifer Barkley,You're young.
Jennifer Barkley,You're smart.
Jennifer Barkley,You're running the biggest city in the district.
Jennifer Barkley,I saw you handle that WiFi thing on TV.
Jennifer Barkley,"My firm is ready to go, as soon as you say the word."
Jennifer Barkley,Are you in or are you out?
Jennifer Barkley,"I mean, this is chaos."
Jennifer Barkley,All those kids keep you up all night?
Jennifer Barkley,So happy with my choices.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm sorry.
Jennifer Barkley,I love that song.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, you guys are going to fit in so great in Washington."
Jennifer Barkley,Wait.
Jennifer Barkley,And they contain very specific policy positions.
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm sorry, you left me four messages last night."
Jennifer Barkley,"You could bail if you want, but it would be embarrassing."
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, official presser is tomorrow at 9:00."
Jennifer Barkley,Ben.
Jennifer Barkley,That is hilarious.
Jennifer Barkley,Most of Congress is drunk all of the time.
Jennifer Barkley,I just don't see the problem.
Jennifer Barkley,This is a job offer.
Jennifer Barkley,Were you guys drunk?
Jennifer Barkley,"You know, there are 30 bedrooms in this house. Bobby's in one, there's a dead guy in another, the rest are free."
Jennifer Barkley,You idiots won't answer my calls and what I have to tell you cannot wait.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,"In a shocking twist to an already juicy story, we have obtained access to Ms. Meagle's account, via a third party."
Jeremy Jamm,Shoes off.
Jeremy Jamm,"Not only do you have no control over your department, you don't even have the respect of your employees."
Jeremy Jamm,Hai!
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, you may not know what she's writing, but we do."
Jeremy Jamm,Page after page of personal attacks on Leslie Knope.
Jeremy Jamm,Same hairdresser.
Jeremy Jamm,Worth every penny.
Jeremy Jamm,I think we need to hear from the unnamed employee behind the tweet.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, perhaps ""them"" can finally give us the answers we need."
Jeremy Jamm,Perhaps he or she
Jeremy Jamm,"I gave his wife new enamels, he gave my wife new yabbos."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, that'll make a nice pull quote for the article about me taking you to the cleaners."
Jeremy Jamm,Hai!
Jeremy Jamm,Can I interest anyone in an authentic Japanese abreakafast?
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, this turned out better than I ever imagined."
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,Yes!
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, Jamm could dig on that."
Jeremy Jamm,This is a house of respect.
Jeremy Jamm,"Keep going, Tom."
Jeremy Jamm,"We need your full, truthful testimony on record."
Jeremy Jamm,It's not sexual.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, I would like to enter into the record a selection of Ms. Meagle's tweets."
Jeremy Jamm,"Boom, knew it."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm just a really big fan of her game.
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, thanks."
Jeremy Jamm,Photoshopped it myself.
Jeremy Jamm,"No, what's the rush?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, this is about the time I hit the hay, so"
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, playing hardball, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,Plenty of time for that later.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, no sweat off my sack."
Jeremy Jamm,"You can take the couch, if you can get my exercise equipment out of the way."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,"Tell us about it, please."
Jeremy Jamm,"Knope, you know the way to a man's heart."
Jeremy Jamm,Hold on.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, okay."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, well, well, heard you want to recant your earlier statements."
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe forever.
Jeremy Jamm,My wife's in Oklahoma for eight months.
Jeremy Jamm,"Sorry, the place is a bit of a mess."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, so this is my weekend dojo."
Jeremy Jamm,Let's talk.
Jeremy Jamm,No shoes... Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,You got it.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, we did a trade."
Jeremy Jamm,"How sweet is this table, by the way, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,"No shoes, you lose."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Beavers, if you please."
Jeremy Jamm,I got it from an actual benihana.
Jeremy Jamm,Cost me 4 grand.
Jeremy Jamm,We'll see if she forgives me.
Jeremy Jamm,"Thanks for coming, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,What the hell is going on?
Jeremy Jamm,"I respect the moxie, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, sure, I'm depressed, and I'm constantly sick, and nothing really brings me joy."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm better now.
Jeremy Jamm,"But, you know, it's good, you know?"
Jeremy Jamm,Tammy doesn't really let me do that stuff anymore.
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,She has my stool analyzed just to keep me honest.
Jeremy Jamm,But Tammy only wants me to eat steak and whiskey.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, it's murder on the old plumbing."
Jeremy Jamm,I love you so much.
Jeremy Jamm,We're done here.
Jeremy Jamm,But it just feels right.
Jeremy Jamm,You wouldn't understand.
Jeremy Jamm,It's a stache thing.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm with Swanson.
Jeremy Jamm,Adolf Hitler!
Jeremy Jamm,I knew we were besties.
Jeremy Jamm,Your plan?
Jeremy Jamm,"Tomorrow, I'm voting for Gryzzl."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I'm convinced."
Jeremy Jamm,And the rest is history.
Jeremy Jamm,She then let me buy her a bunch of purses.
Jeremy Jamm,"She saw me nail Gangsta's Paradise, I saw her bite the door guy."
Jeremy Jamm,Stache bros.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Help me, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,I used to be so great.
Jeremy Jamm,"Turns out, I don't care."
Jeremy Jamm,"However, here's the problem."
Jeremy Jamm,That's the only bid out there right now.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, that's true."
Jeremy Jamm,Naming rights for the kids' tent go to Jamm Orthodontics for 100 smackers.
Jeremy Jamm,Now that is the steal of the day.
Jeremy Jamm,She lets me rub up against her leg sometimes.
Jeremy Jamm,I've actually always been attracted to this one.
Jeremy Jamm,Just kidding.
Jeremy Jamm,Don't you ladies look nice For once?
Jeremy Jamm,We haven't done the deed yet.
Jeremy Jamm,That won't be necessary.
Jeremy Jamm,"If I do, does Tammy get to keep the gold?"
Jeremy Jamm,More hair came out.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, well, well."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, look at that."
Jeremy Jamm,"It's what we in the Jamm family call ""Payback time."""
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Jeremy Jamm,Everybody thought so.
Jeremy Jamm,Remember?
Jeremy Jamm,Hit it off at karaoke.
Jeremy Jamm,You can come in for a minute.
Jeremy Jamm,Jammy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hold up, little chica."
Jeremy Jamm,"How about if in the Jamm zone, there's no married chicks allowed?"
Jeremy Jamm,Hey.
Jeremy Jamm,You just got jammed.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, psych."
Jeremy Jamm,You don't even have to be Asian to do math that simple.
Jeremy Jamm,"Now, seeing as how the future of lot 48 is open for debate, I move we sell it to Paunch Burger for a nice profit."
Jeremy Jamm,"I happen to know for a fact that Pawnee's favorite fast food restaurant, Paunch Burger, needs a new location."
Jeremy Jamm,Let the record show that everyone is raising their hands.
Jeremy Jamm,Who here thinks parks are stupid?
Jeremy Jamm,How about no park?
Jeremy Jamm,My front lawn?
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilman, Pawneeans, satisfied customers of Jamm Orthodontics, as we discuss what type of park to put on lot 48, I had a thought."
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,"I missed you, too."
Jeremy Jamm,I just farted.
Jeremy Jamm,"Knopey, my girl, wuddup?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, because I invented it."
Jeremy Jamm,"Maybe not, but I'm not not going to win nothing."
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, I think we've done a lot of good here today."
Jeremy Jamm,Paul.
Jeremy Jamm,The hell you nerds doing here?
Jeremy Jamm,You can't just show up at my door like this.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, you have the floor."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, hey, lady, get that thing off my gnome."
Jeremy Jamm,He is dryhumping my garden gnome.
Jeremy Jamm,Stupid beast.
Jeremy Jamm,You just got jammed.
Jeremy Jamm,It didn't work.
Jeremy Jamm,"As soon as Knope is gone, these are going up all over Chambers."
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm for three!
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, boy."
Jeremy Jamm,Nice try.
Jeremy Jamm,Ha-ha.
Jeremy Jamm,"The thing is, Leslie, this kind of decision is it's not really up to you anymore."
Jeremy Jamm,"Because the voters, to use a technical political term, gave you the stanky boot."
Jeremy Jamm,Right now.
Jeremy Jamm,"But we'll keep your money safe, baby girl."
Jeremy Jamm,"What, you think I'm gonna use it to put a new limestone shower in my office?"
Jeremy Jamm,"I propose that we table this discussion until, let's say, the second Knope is gone."
Jeremy Jamm,"Later, bunheads."
Jeremy Jamm,Glass!
Jeremy Jamm,I want that hula hoop off my 'Vette.
Jeremy Jamm,I want these kids off my lawn.
Jeremy Jamm,"Great, now call off the actual dogs."
Jeremy Jamm,Winner take all.
Jeremy Jamm,"In 90 days, we'll put our plans to a vote."
Jeremy Jamm,Gentleman's agreement.
Jeremy Jamm,Fine.
Jeremy Jamm,I'll call the police.
Jeremy Jamm,"Before we go any further, I need to ask my girlfriend how she wants me to vote."
Jeremy Jamm,All right.
Jeremy Jamm,"You know, in some weird, perverted, sexual way, I'm gonna miss you when you're gone."
Jeremy Jamm,"Listen, let us celebrate this progress by sharing these authentic edamame, or Tokyo beans."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I don't see anyone better."
Jeremy Jamm,Okay.
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's tear this chick a new one, shall we?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, we have found many emails showing how you sexually harassed Leslie Knope's assistant."
Jeremy Jamm,You once posted a video of yourself drinking alcohol in City Hall while you were still a minor.
Jeremy Jamm,How do you justify that?
Jeremy Jamm,Wow.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, are you a ventriloquist?"
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, that is amazing how you make your words come out of Ms. Knope's mouth."
Jeremy Jamm,Would you like to put her on your knee?
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, that'd be really fun."
Jeremy Jamm,"Just three years ago, you drove"
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, uh, kids? Would you like to learn how Leslie got your bill passed? Councilwoman Knope traded my vote for her What the hell, man? Why'd you do that?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, this is a teaching moment? Great."
Jeremy Jamm,"Boy, you know, I can't believe you traded your office to keep this craphole pool open for a couple more weeks a year."
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,"By ""kids,"" I mean turds."
Jeremy Jamm,Can't wait to drop my kids at the pool.
Jeremy Jamm,We got a deal.
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, if he can catch raccoons as well as he can teach six year olds to pop and lock, he's a home run."
Jeremy Jamm,"Not bad, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"You did a heck of a job, Vernie."
Jeremy Jamm,"Thank you, you're done."
Jeremy Jamm,#NAME?
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, listen, keep your mouths shut about the affidavit, I'll drop the suit, okay?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, it's me."
Jeremy Jamm,We got Jammed.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, well."
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm way ahead of you there, girly."
Jeremy Jamm,I got the perfect guy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Friend of mine, bit of an alcoholic, a little grabby, either a war hero or war criminal, depending on who you ask, but a good dude."
Jeremy Jamm,I do his teeth.
Jeremy Jamm,And?
Jeremy Jamm,"A few coffee stains up front, but his canines are insane."
Jeremy Jamm,"They are excellent, beet red."
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, maybe you would like to explain this to her, please?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, this one is mine, then Dexhart, then you."
Jeremy Jamm,This whole place runs on dibs.
Jeremy Jamm,Boring!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, you know what, he's not a rack of ribs, so stop grilling him."
Jeremy Jamm,Nailed it.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, ga ga gaho."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hold up, that's enough."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,I barely touched you.
Jeremy Jamm,And?
Jeremy Jamm,What's up?
Jeremy Jamm,"Tom, do you want to know why I moved to Pawnee?"
Jeremy Jamm,Occupied!
Jeremy Jamm,"You seem to be forgetting that I already told Vern he got the job, and he already bought a new speedboat."
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, no, she didn't."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm just sick of being on the losing side.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm going to tell everyone this was my idea.
Jeremy Jamm,Retro-jammed.
Jeremy Jamm,Dynamite gums.
Jeremy Jamm,Beautiful.
Jeremy Jamm,I don't known if i would call it your bathroom.
Jeremy Jamm,"Beautiful, Tom."
Jeremy Jamm,I think it is crazy that the most junior city councilor gets a private bathroom just because she is a girl.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,Let's solve this.
Jeremy Jamm,Tell you what I'm going to do.
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm going to drop my liquids in here, take my solids down the hall."
Jeremy Jamm,Deal?
Jeremy Jamm,Fine.
Jeremy Jamm,Your loss.
Jeremy Jamm,It's because the two leading industries here are corn syrup and rubber nipples.
Jeremy Jamm,Hang on a second.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, no? Why is that?"
Jeremy Jamm,It is a dentistry jackpot.
Jeremy Jamm,"Buying time, I see."
Jeremy Jamm,Sloppy technique.
Jeremy Jamm,You're missing the backs of your upper canines.
Jeremy Jamm,Complimentary toothbrush?
Jeremy Jamm,I'm pushing the vote through and it won't pass.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, yeah, we're not postponing anything, okay?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, well, love the hair!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I don't mean to brag, but, uh, I've got Irritable Bowel Syndrome."
Jeremy Jamm,I want your toilet.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, why don't you, uh why don't you sweeten the pot?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Actually, Tommy, we need to talk."
Jeremy Jamm,"Not my initials, but thank you so much."
Jeremy Jamm,Real nice.
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,Can you give me even one reason why you're the right man for this job?
Jeremy Jamm,That's mine now.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm going to steal it.
Jeremy Jamm,I like that.
Jeremy Jamm,"It's genius, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, it is the opinion of this committee that you are terrible."
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, you know what, I see what you're doing."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I mean, maybe I accidentally said something that wasn't-- Let me see that."
Jeremy Jamm,And why exactly would I do that?
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh summer heat boy and girl meet but ah, oh, those summer nights"
Jeremy Jamm,Stop stonewalling and tell us what happened here!
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Knope, do you have a statement?"
Jeremy Jamm,"And two, to turn this whole thing into a media circus."
Jeremy Jamm,"One, to find out exactly how this offensive tweet came to be sent."
Jeremy Jamm,These hearings have two goals.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, let's begin."
Jeremy Jamm,You have my word on it!
Jeremy Jamm,This will be blown way out of proportion!
Jeremy Jamm,"We are going to hold hearing after hearing, until we are satisfied."
Jeremy Jamm,This is how Leslie Knope runs her Parks Department?
Jeremy Jamm,9/11!
Jeremy Jamm,Those men are heroes who deserve respect!
Jeremy Jamm,"She's my cherry pie, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Jeremy Jamm,It's gonna be fun.
Jeremy Jamm,"Just general rock, man."
Jeremy Jamm,"Dahnahnah, rock and roll, yeah, poison"
Jeremy Jamm,Gonna be pretty good.
Jeremy Jamm,Oh.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, sadly, due to your ""intracksidence"""
Jeremy Jamm,We may never find out what happened.
Jeremy Jamm,"When this sick, depraved tweet first came to light, you said, ""The account was probably hacked by some bored teenager."""
Jeremy Jamm,Now you're saying it's an unfortunate mistake.
Jeremy Jamm,Now I want you to be very careful about eating these.
Jeremy Jamm,I don't think I'm out of line when I say that this scandal makes Benghazi look like whitewater!
Jeremy Jamm,"You eat the shells, and you throw the seeds out."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ugh, Lezzie."
Jeremy Jamm,"Come on, I'm getting bored."
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, we've been at this for hours."
Jeremy Jamm,Can we please take a break?
Jeremy Jamm,Why do you keep flip-flopping?
Jeremy Jamm,I do.
Jeremy Jamm,You are my Nemesis.
Jeremy Jamm,And kudos on that pronunciation.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, no, no, no."
Jeremy Jamm,Self Jamm!
Jeremy Jamm,"I'll see you in court, Swanson, and, uh, bring your checkbook."
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, Paul, let's go."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm Sandra Dee.
Jeremy Jamm,That's more of my register.
Jeremy Jamm,You're Zuko.
Jeremy Jamm,"He got friendly, holdin' my hand"
Jeremy Jamm,"He was sweet, just turned 18"
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,You're the Superman to my Lex Luthor.
Jeremy Jamm,Pretty sure we got their bass player.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,Firemen?
Jeremy Jamm,Eggplants?
Jeremy Jamm,Tongue baths?
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm about to play golf with a guy who was almost on The Apprentice, so this better be good."
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm likes the sound of that.
Jeremy Jamm,"""The definition of personal."""
Jeremy Jamm,It's nothing personal.
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's make it five I.O.U.s, and you got a deal."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, did someone say ""dental plan""?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Deal, guys."
Jeremy Jamm,You must really want that park.
Jeremy Jamm,"Sorry, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,"No, I was with Johnny Cougar Mellencamp at that music fest."
Jeremy Jamm,That's all I wanted to hear.
Jeremy Jamm,"Leslie, you're my best friend too."
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, well, uh, motion to end this session early so nothing can get done."
Jeremy Jamm,Motion to table.
Jeremy Jamm,Motion to table this bill.
Jeremy Jamm,"We both thought, biggest yabbos we've ever seen in-- What the hell? That was important."
Jeremy Jamm,We're just looking for any possible way to get you recalled because we don't like you.
Jeremy Jamm,You got Jammed by your own team.
Jeremy Jamm,No?
Jeremy Jamm,Are you guys coming back to my place?
Jeremy Jamm,Lex Luthor is rich.
Jeremy Jamm,"There's a cover band around here they call themselves ""Cherry Pie."""
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,What can I say?
Jeremy Jamm,You wore me down.
Jeremy Jamm,"I will give you my word, and I will put it in writing, so I can't back out."
Jeremy Jamm,We won't touch the money for one year.
Jeremy Jamm,"And if the economy holds up, you can start construction then."
Jeremy Jamm,You ever heard of warrant?
Jeremy Jamm,What's what's or are you guys going back to... we wrapping up the weekend?
Jeremy Jamm,That is gonna be off the hook!
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe you don't.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, uh, I think we can all agree this concert blows, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilman Jeremy Jamm, Jamm orthodontics."
Jeremy Jamm,How's it going?
Jeremy Jamm,"Unexpected play here, Superman."
Jeremy Jamm,"Not exactly sure what you're going for, but I dig your Gambit."
Jeremy Jamm,I haven't seen it.
Jeremy Jamm,Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.
Jeremy Jamm,I find his voice very grating.
Jeremy Jamm,"You guys really want to see a crowd, you might want to stop by my secession rally later tonight."
Jeremy Jamm,You can't stop this train.
Jeremy Jamm,You know who else had a plan?
Jeremy Jamm,"By the time this all gets cleared up, the people will be frothing at the mouth for that beef."
Jeremy Jamm,So this one could go either way.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm kind of a badass wild card.
Jeremy Jamm,Just come to Jamm Orthodontics.
Jeremy Jamm,I can fix those chompers for you.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, butterteeth, what's up?"
Jeremy Jamm,More like who am I doing?
Jeremy Jamm,Parks are stupid.
Jeremy Jamm,No one wants a park here.
Jeremy Jamm,No one.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm free.
Jeremy Jamm,What's up?
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, dead ringer for Courtney ThorneSmith."
Jeremy Jamm,She works at the gas station.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, thank you very much."
Jeremy Jamm,Some fat Hawaiian guy left it in my waiting room.
Jeremy Jamm,"When he came back, I was all like, ""Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, no, I haven't seen it."""
Jeremy Jamm,Make all the ruckus you want.
Jeremy Jamm,Classic.
Jeremy Jamm,Hot dogs?
Jeremy Jamm,"That's right, stretch, and looking mighty fly in that suit, brother."
Jeremy Jamm,"You know I have irritable bowel syndrome, you racist."
Jeremy Jamm,What are you doing here?
Jeremy Jamm,Parks are stupid.
Jeremy Jamm,Two days free shipping for this guy.
Jeremy Jamm,"You are looking at a prime customer, everybody."
Jeremy Jamm,"Amazon, baby, that's how."
Jeremy Jamm,Who knows what that does?
Jeremy Jamm,Stink bomb!
Jeremy Jamm,Check this out.
Jeremy Jamm,"This wedding is canceled, 'cause the bride is a bhole."
Jeremy Jamm,"So sorry, guys!"
Jeremy Jamm,I don't think you understand that I would have got a cut of that new Paunch Burger if she hadn't screwed everything up.
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, boo, Leslie, boo."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm being awesome.
Jeremy Jamm,"Here comes the boo all dressed in boo boo, Leslie Knope boo, boooooooo Boo!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, Leslie Knope, boo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, boo."
Jeremy Jamm,You better make sure my aunt gets her megaphone back.
Jeremy Jamm,"No, this isn't over, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,Mm.
Jeremy Jamm,That belongs to my aunt.
Jeremy Jamm,You better give me back that megaphone.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, this excellent bill only allows someone to vote in a Pawnee election, for example, the upcoming recall election, if their I.D. lists an official Pawnee address."
Jeremy Jamm,Get me a Budweiser Black Crown.
Jeremy Jamm,You guys got Black Crown here?
Jeremy Jamm,"If not, you should."
Jeremy Jamm,But why read it when you can shove it right in your face?
Jeremy Jamm,My plan for lot 48 is simple.
Jeremy Jamm,History will decide.
Jeremy Jamm,Let the record show there was a standing ovation.
Jeremy Jamm,"No, please, everyone be seated."
Jeremy Jamm,"Thank you, Bill."
Jeremy Jamm,I got dibs on the dinosaur.
Jeremy Jamm,And the pirate and the dolphin.
Jeremy Jamm,I want all of 'em.
Jeremy Jamm,Sweet.
Jeremy Jamm,"Luck has nothing to do with it, Chris."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I could be a pro!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Jeremy Jamm,We're just goosing our water supply with fluoride?
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, come on."
Jeremy Jamm,Are we really gonna force every Pawnee resident to ingest a chemical we know nothing about?
Jeremy Jamm,Mmhmm.
Jeremy Jamm,You guys sound like school.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ah, all right."
Jeremy Jamm,I want to sell this lot to Paunch Burger.
Jeremy Jamm,Here's why.
Jeremy Jamm,We make money.
Jeremy Jamm,They make money.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, she's right, Swanson."
Jeremy Jamm,I do love it.
Jeremy Jamm,You should relax a little.
Jeremy Jamm,Have a snow cone.
Jeremy Jamm,Leslie's buying all night.
Jeremy Jamm,That lot is mine.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, you're too late, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,I don't have anyone I care about.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, well, joke's on you."
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's get this party started with another one, gang!"
Jeremy Jamm,"No, no, you can't do that."
Jeremy Jamm,"Chris, very sorry."
Jeremy Jamm,That's my bad.
Jeremy Jamm,"My bad, guys."
Jeremy Jamm,"""The Knope Protocol""?"
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm out.
Jeremy Jamm,Presentation over.
Jeremy Jamm,That's a win win win win.
Jeremy Jamm,We eat burgers.
Jeremy Jamm,They make burgers.
Jeremy Jamm,What?
Jeremy Jamm,And who's gonna make me?
Jeremy Jamm,Here comes the bride.
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Jeremy Jamm,Get these cameras outta here!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Knope!"
Jeremy Jamm,Wrap it up!
Jeremy Jamm,"Namecalling, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, dadoy."
Jeremy Jamm,"Classy move, douche bag."
Jeremy Jamm,Yield.
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah!
Jeremy Jamm,Come on!
Jeremy Jamm,Wish I had my ninja stars!
Jeremy Jamm,No sitting.
Jeremy Jamm,"Also, more importantly, it's in the rules."
Jeremy Jamm,[Bleep]!
Jeremy Jamm,"Ow, [bleep]!"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm gonna send this straight to tosh.
Jeremy Jamm,The stupid Eagletonians are totally getting the pwned by these bees.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, man, this is amazing, man."
Jeremy Jamm,"Lucy Liu, Nintendo, Gangnam Style, sushi, et cetera, et cetera."
Jeremy Jamm,I love Chinese crap.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, you know what, Eagleton, enough!"
Jeremy Jamm,Whose dumbass idea was it for them to merge anyway?
Jeremy Jamm,The reverb is the best part.
Jeremy Jamm,As a matter of fact I say we should secede from Eagleton!
Jeremy Jamm,Hey!
Jeremy Jamm,"What do you got in there for me, some dirty mags?"
Jeremy Jamm,Whatever.
Jeremy Jamm,Got a lotta filth in my kindle anyway.
Jeremy Jamm,We can just hang.
Jeremy Jamm,Wanna come up?
Jeremy Jamm,Excuse me.
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,"Mm, mm, mm."
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,"Excuse me, Mike."
Jeremy Jamm,"That's, uh, best friend."
Jeremy Jamm,Oops.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, maybe that's 'cause I turned up the heat to 90, and, uh, oh, the knob broke off in my hand."
Jeremy Jamm,"Awesome idea, Lezzie."
Jeremy Jamm,Hey!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, you're not allowed to receive help from the crowd."
Jeremy Jamm,That's strike two.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, man, leave my gong alone."
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,You got me.
Jeremy Jamm,I was told there'd be a free barbecue buffet?
Jeremy Jamm,Sure about that?
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, on the one hand, I love cutting government programs."
Jeremy Jamm,"On the other hand, minigolf rules."
Jeremy Jamm,"And on the third hand, I hate both you and Ron Swanson."
Jeremy Jamm,I got five bathrooms.
Jeremy Jamm,This is an outrage.
Jeremy Jamm,"Wait a minute, what? He punched me in the teeth."
Jeremy Jamm,Five bathrooms.
Jeremy Jamm,You see my house?
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, it is a good thing."
Jeremy Jamm,You broke my tooth.
Jeremy Jamm,Ow.
Jeremy Jamm,Ow.
Jeremy Jamm,You want me to just pound
Jeremy Jamm,Is that what you like?
Jeremy Jamm,"What, kick your ass?"
Jeremy Jamm,If I do what again?
Jeremy Jamm,Don't you touch me.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, get off me, what the hell, man?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I know."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, as noted in Article nine, Paragraph two"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, and I called a special session and untabled it."
Jeremy Jamm,What's up with the roller skates?
Jeremy Jamm,I know you do.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, it's gonna be so good."
Jeremy Jamm,So cold.
Jeremy Jamm,It's so cold.
Jeremy Jamm,Make that heat go away!
Jeremy Jamm,"Come on, get! Come on, girl."
Jeremy Jamm,Get!
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, it is."
Jeremy Jamm,No sitting.
Jeremy Jamm,How I know you would love an ice-cold frozen marg.
Jeremy Jamm,"Bam, strike one."
Jeremy Jamm,Oh! My beautiful curls!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, just kidding, bud."
Jeremy Jamm,Milton doesn't have a lot of time left on earth.
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe you should yield the floor.
Jeremy Jamm,Are you dookin' on my chest right now?
Jeremy Jamm,A filibuster?
Jeremy Jamm,Will the councilwoman yield her time so we can vote on this sucker?
Jeremy Jamm,I'm a blades guy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I don't care."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Knope, how you feeling over there? You go pee-pee? Pee-pee times? Make wee-wee?"
Jeremy Jamm,"I don't want fluoride in the water because I'm a dentist, and I like cavities."
Jeremy Jamm,I don't know.
Jeremy Jamm,Got an Asian girl to sit in it once.
Jeremy Jamm,"Japanese, Muslim, Jewish, none of those weird countries."
Jeremy Jamm,Apology accepted.
Jeremy Jamm,"You got my vote, hombre."
Jeremy Jamm,"You know, I've actually come around to your way of thinking on this."
Jeremy Jamm,"My only thought is, why stop here?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Ladies and gentlemen, Sweetums president Jessica Wicks."
Jeremy Jamm,Sweetums is prepared to take over the management of Pawnee's water.
Jeremy Jamm,This is gonna save this town beaucoup bucks.
Jeremy Jamm,Take a sip of this delicious water and imagine it coming out of your faucets at home.
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Jeremy Jamm,Now Swansuck punches me in the mouth.
Jeremy Jamm,Strychnine and cyanide.
Jeremy Jamm,Too late. We're going to fill the whole reservoir with this stuff.
Jeremy Jamm,This munch throws me into a swimming pool.
Jeremy Jamm,Checkmate.
Jeremy Jamm,Or regular Indian.
Jeremy Jamm,We haven't found any American Indian artifacts.
Jeremy Jamm,Ron. I need that crotch blinder!
Jeremy Jamm,Exactly.
Jeremy Jamm,"It's over, Tammy."
Jeremy Jamm,But I respect the hell out of your short game.
Jeremy Jamm,"Pawnee's cavity problem is why a small town dentist, like me, can afford such a boss ride."
Jeremy Jamm,Nothing will change that.
Jeremy Jamm,"Swanson, I hate you."
Jeremy Jamm,"You definitely understand what chemicals are, Perd."
Jeremy Jamm,Wow.
Jeremy Jamm,"I would suggest if you want to contact the psychopath that wants to turn your kids into bad at math, communist fluoride zombies, well, just call the number at the bottom of your screen."
Jeremy Jamm,More competing for my vote.
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe.
Jeremy Jamm,"The nurse still won't have sex with me, and she's not even queer."
Jeremy Jamm,This is [Bleep]ing bull[bleep].
Jeremy Jamm,Boom.
Jeremy Jamm,And you brought me back from the brink.
Jeremy Jamm,"So, I can't choose sides."
Jeremy Jamm,"Although, if I had to pick one side, it would be Lucy Liu's backside."
Jeremy Jamm,So let's do it.
Jeremy Jamm,You are my two all-time best friends.
Jeremy Jamm,I just wanted to let you know that I will be abstaining from the vote today.
Jeremy Jamm,"So clearly, this is not offensive."
Jeremy Jamm,You know what else is a chemical?
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Brokemons."
Jeremy Jamm,Goodbye.
Jeremy Jamm,It's not offensive.
Jeremy Jamm,"To hell with you, woman."
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Jeremy Jamm,"It's over, Tammy."
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Jeremy Jamm,That sounds highly offensive.
Jeremy Jamm,This is simply how people like us operate.
Jeremy Jamm,Last night you bring in a teenage girl to pump me full of snow cones.
Jeremy Jamm,Absolutely not.
Jeremy Jamm,"A few months ago, you traded me your office for that stupid swimming pool bill."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, don't act so shocked."
Jeremy Jamm,What can you offer me to change my mind?
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, so, in conclusion fluoride, chemical, tiny genitals, misinformation, panic, death, Jenny McCarthy."
Jeremy Jamm,Let's talk deal.
Jeremy Jamm,Everyone knows that.
Jeremy Jamm,My word is garbage.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I was, but it doesn't have to go down that way."
Jeremy Jamm,"What's up, yellow head?"
Jeremy Jamm,Knew it.
Jeremy Jamm,"Look, I'm telling the truth here, lady."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm not a baby! I'm a big boy!
Jeremy Jamm,I am very sorry.
Jeremy Jamm,"All the steak and whiskey, I have to wear a diaper."
Jeremy Jamm,You sure make a guy feel like a real lady.
Jeremy Jamm,What are you wearing?
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, well, I'm kind of still on the fence about this budget thing, but I do love watching you guys squabble over me."
Jeremy Jamm,Snow cones are half the fun.
Jeremy Jamm,Do it.
Jeremy Jamm,Hold up.
Jeremy Jamm,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Jeremy Jamm,"You better find your stroke, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,"Speaking of, uh, where are the witches?"
Jeremy Jamm,How dare you demean the value of the political points I'm scoring?
Jeremy Jamm,"Tammy, I've given this a lot of thought."
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, the doors are locked, windows secured, there is no way Tammy's getting in here."
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, this is not over, Ms. Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,Tam-- No!
Jeremy Jamm,How many times are we gonna do this?
Jeremy Jamm,"As a matter of fact, I would like to propose my own bill the Pawnee Clean Water Bill, which prohibits adding anything to our water supply forever."
Jeremy Jamm,Tammy.
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm still technically married, but my wife knows the deal."
Jeremy Jamm,"Once again, open invitation."
Jeremy Jamm,It smells good.
Jeremy Jamm,"No can do, Knopey."
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, how about this?"
Jeremy Jamm,You two play each other.
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilwoman Leslie Knope wants to put fluoride, which is a chemical, into your drinking water."
Jeremy Jamm,Nine holes.
Jeremy Jamm,No one's talking
Jeremy Jamm,I'll bid 100 bucks.
Jeremy Jamm,They just made me realize how unhealthy this is.
Jeremy Jamm,There's no sheik.
Jeremy Jamm,We should break up.
Jeremy Jamm,Literally.
Jeremy Jamm,"There's no 3,000."
Jeremy Jamm,Less talk.
Jeremy Jamm,That's why.
Jeremy Jamm,It's 100 bucks.
Jeremy Jamm,"Everyone, take your seats, so this witch hunt may proceed as scheduled."
Jeremy Jamm,It's 'cause I'm sick of this whole Parks and Rec gang.
Jeremy Jamm,"'Cause there's no sheik, and there's no old lady with a diamond what is it, a diamond eye patch?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'll tell you why.
Jeremy Jamm,It's my bid.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, if it isn't the defendant, Ron Swansuck."
Jeremy Jamm,Winner gets my vote.
Jeremy Jamm,There's no bidding war.
Jerry Gergich,"But really, I have no problem with the two of you dating."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,I'll do it for Li'I Sebastian.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Geez, it does look like you."
Jerry Gergich,"really, I mean, look at you."
Jerry Gergich,Mmm-hmm.
Jerry Gergich,"You're just, you know, beautiful."
Jerry Gergich,"Listen, tell her come to the party and I don't mind at all."
Jerry Gergich,Muncie?
Jerry Gergich,You're a very thoughtful guy.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, mine just says, ""Get well soon."""
Jerry Gergich,"If it matters, probably not, April was the last one to use it."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you can text without looking at your phone?"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh really, then what were you doing by the coffee cart earlier."
Jerry Gergich,Yay!
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I am just so, so sorry."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Les-- um, ma'am, uh, this public forum, it is just about improvements that we can make to the rec center."
Jerry Gergich,I don't know.
Jerry Gergich,I just wanna go back to work.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, so now you're sure that everything is okay, you know, down there?"
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, that is great."
Jerry Gergich,Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Ron! Welcome"
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez, I really shouldn't be involved in something"
Jerry Gergich,What are you doing in my bathroom?
Jerry Gergich,Li'I Sebastian!
Jerry Gergich,"So, for my painting, I chose one of my very favorite Greek myths, the centaur goddess, Dyaphena, slaying a great stag."
Jerry Gergich,That's my boss.
Jerry Gergich,You ready for the voiceover?
Jerry Gergich,Check this out.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, are there any more recommendations for new games at the rec center?"
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Chris."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, I would like you to meet my daughter, Millicent."
Jerry Gergich,Isn't she beautiful?
Jerry Gergich,"No, what about my poem?"
Jerry Gergich,"Well, because I thought you were Gayle."
Jerry Gergich,"No, see, I think that Comic Sans always screams ""fun."""
Jerry Gergich,Right?
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Fine.
Jerry Gergich,"But, man, those ""r""s in Helvetica, they're just, you know, like, really popping for me."
Jerry Gergich,This really isn't what Chris asked us to do.
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, maybe we should just stick to the assignment."
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,"So be honest, what do you guys think?"
Jerry Gergich,Whatever.
Jerry Gergich,"So, now, you're telling me I have to go unpack it?"
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, you guys, who is this? This looks just like Ow, that was loud."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, if you want to take the rest of the night off, you know, that would be fine."
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, weekends are for dreaming."
Jerry Gergich,What would you put in there?
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, but she was in the hospital."
Jerry Gergich,Last year you wrote me up for making personal phone calls to my mom.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,You are a government worker.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I actually was a ranger for 12 years"
Jerry Gergich,They're all black.
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, thank you."
Jerry Gergich,I should lead a teen abstinence workshop.
Jerry Gergich,This is a government job.
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Jerry Gergich,And I trust you.
Jerry Gergich,"Chris, I appreciate the gesture, it's very nice, but, Milly, she's a grown woman, and of course I trust her."
Jerry Gergich,You would like to date my daughter.
Jerry Gergich,"We have a surprise winner, April."
Jerry Gergich,April wins two tickets to the pawnee monoplex.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, anyway, the fundraising challenge is over, and the winner whoa."
Jerry Gergich,It's not my fault.
Jerry Gergich,"Ooh, cupcakes."
Jerry Gergich,She broke up with Chris.
Jerry Gergich,It happened.
Jerry Gergich,Plus isn't dreaming big exactly what got you in trouble with your old company?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that was Milli."
Jerry Gergich,I'm very upset.
Jerry Gergich,I get nervous.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, love you too."
Jerry Gergich,Of course.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, tom, but Chris, he just wanted us I mean, really, you've gone way off track."
Jerry Gergich,"On it, boss."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you just hang in there, okay?"
Jerry Gergich,Bye bye.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, no, tonight's not good."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that's okay."
Jerry Gergich,Socks.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I know this one."
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,You got it.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, I packed everything up."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, let me buy you all a drink."
Jerry Gergich,that's amazing.
Jerry Gergich,Wow!
Jerry Gergich,Yep.
Jerry Gergich,"Stop being so pretentious, Kyle."
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Jerry Gergich,Yep.
Jerry Gergich,"But I'm sorry, 16, that just seems too young to be on birth control."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, yes, my daughter might think she is old enough to be sexually active with her boyfriend."
Jerry Gergich,The weather has been so weird lately.
Jerry Gergich,They are all rappists.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I was 24 when Gayle took my virginity."
Jerry Gergich,"They're rappers, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,You know what I should do?
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go have lunch with my daughter!"
Jerry Gergich,"I say she looks like my wife, Gayle, and Gayle agrees."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Chris, if you wanted, you know, you should join us for lunch."
Jerry Gergich,She gets me.
Jerry Gergich,"My daughter, she's really sweet."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, mine says, ""You have a cute butt."""
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, there's a 13th century Italian poem by Dante Alighieri that would be very appropriate."
Jerry Gergich,you guys didn't tell me we were doing this.
Jerry Gergich,"I, I did not know that I was supposed to come up with something."
Jerry Gergich,Come on in.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Jerry Gergich,"The question is, why is my memo different than everyone else's?"
Jerry Gergich,"Dyaphena, she is this powerful goddess, and I've been thinking a lot about powerful women, and subconsciously, I painted you."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, last year, they had pizza."
Jerry Gergich,I'm going to take it right down.
Jerry Gergich,We listen to some Anita Baker.
Jerry Gergich,Few hours?
Jerry Gergich,"And then, well, we hold hands for a while."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,I don't think she does.
Jerry Gergich,"We go, we split a huge piece of cotton candy cheesecake from Cakey J's Cheesecake Facility."
Jerry Gergich,Why?
Jerry Gergich,Guys guys What do I do?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, come on."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of the same thing.
Jerry Gergich,"April, do you have that usage report that I asked for?"
Jerry Gergich,"Please, Ron, I am very sorry."
Jerry Gergich,I mean to be honest that seems like the kind of thing I would do and I didn't think you would give in.
Jerry Gergich,But it's great because my wife Gayle makes such a big deal out of it.
Jerry Gergich,"My birthday is February 29th, so I only get one real birthday, you know, once every four years."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, let's face it, it's a tough one to remember."
Jerry Gergich,"She meets up with some friends, and I turn in early."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, it is okay."
Jerry Gergich,I love Great Lakes wine.
Jerry Gergich,Norton Construction just sent this over.
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,"So, Webster's dictionary describes a pork as a --No, it's park. Park."
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,What do I have to do?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, did we lose more seniors in the woods?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's a sinkhole, right?"
Jerry Gergich,No!
Jerry Gergich,"No, no."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Jerry Gergich,Can I at least grab the gloves?
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Now?
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,Check it out.
Jerry Gergich,Thanks.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle gave me this shirt yesterday as a birthday present.
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank you!"
Jerry Gergich,"Well, anyway, tonight we are gonna spice things up with a little competition."
Jerry Gergich,Whoever raises the most money by the end of the night will win two free movie passes to the pawnee monoplex.
Jerry Gergich,"I don't really know why you would need my social security number, but well, yeah, no."
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,"Hi, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,You're right.
Jerry Gergich,"I believe I have heard Donna talk about Prince, a lot."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, but what about the sinkhole?"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, first of all, I don't like it when you guys use that term."
Jerry Gergich,I guess it couldn't hurt to give it to you.
Jerry Gergich,You didn't bring a tent?
Jerry Gergich,It's 2 1 0
Jerry Gergich,Are they going to get pizza again?
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, are you mad at me?"
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez, I'm sorry."
Jerry Gergich,Whoa.
Jerry Gergich,"'Cause without eyebrows, I can't really tell."
Jerry Gergich,"Ah, geez."
Jerry Gergich,"You're probably thinking, how could it possibly be fun?"
Jerry Gergich,So tonight is going to be fun.
Jerry Gergich,"I know this kind of thing can be a grind, but Ben said that this is the most important thing we can do to help Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Really, wow."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie what are you doing?
Jerry Gergich,You told me to say your name.
Jerry Gergich,Chris.
Jerry Gergich,We didn't get to the drug store for my liver medication.
Jerry Gergich,"This is really, this is really great."
Jerry Gergich,Huh?
Jerry Gergich,I'm not.
Jerry Gergich,"Geez, okay."
Jerry Gergich,I guess I put too much fuel in the torch.
Jerry Gergich,"Whoa, thanks, guys."
Jerry Gergich,There are almost a hundred people out there!
Jerry Gergich,"Please, you've got to stop saying things like that to me."
Jerry Gergich,"But for the record, I came through."
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, she did."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that sounds like The Newlywed Game."
Jerry Gergich,"All right, it is time for the 12th Leslie Knope Fundraising Phone Bank."
Jerry Gergich,Is everybody feeling good?
Jerry Gergich,Mmm?
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,"Forget it, Macklin, you're too late I'm sorry, guys."
Jerry Gergich,I cannot see any
Jerry Gergich,"Got you a little pickmeup, Tommy."
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, it's the 21st century."
Jerry Gergich,You know what? There's a bed and breakfast right up the road.
Jerry Gergich,I'm gonna head there.
Jerry Gergich,That would be so adorable!
Jerry Gergich,That's sweet.
Jerry Gergich,The two of you sharing a nice bottle of
Jerry Gergich,That's right.

Jerry Gergich,"Gotta go, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,"Yep! Hey, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,Doing what I can.
Jerry Gergich,But is there anything I should know? Any new info?
Jerry Gergich,"So now I'm going to head to the house, say hey to Gayle, wish my daughter a happy belated birthday It was yesterday And then I'm gonna head back out and hit all the towns in the southeast."
Jerry Gergich,"And so far, there is not one incorrect fact."
Jerry Gergich,And I interviewed all the people you mentioned.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, well, well, look, who's ahead of the curve."
Jerry Gergich,A tripledecker ham and cheese from the cafeteria.
Jerry Gergich,"Indianapolis, Bloomington, Lafayette, Muncie, Gary All the places you mention in the book."
Jerry Gergich,Always makes me feel better.
Jerry Gergich,"Heck, I still use my original I.D. card from my first day on the job."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, come on."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, where's my lovely daughter tonight?"
Jerry Gergich,"So, anyway, we were gonna go to lunch, so"

Jerry Gergich,Found a date for Ann.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Jerry Gergich,Bobby Newport.
Jerry Gergich,Bobby.
Jerry Gergich,Newport.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,"I have been here, well, 30 some years, and the best way to cope with this job is to do everything the exact same way every day."
Jerry Gergich,I've been all over the State.
Jerry Gergich,Here's the thing.
Jerry Gergich,Ma'am.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,"On my first day here, the old director, he called me Jerry, and I just didn't think I should correct him."
Jerry Gergich,So I just got a big thing of lighter fluid.
Jerry Gergich,"Actually, my real name is Gary."
Jerry Gergich,"I said, pork, which By the way, they have a great pork sandwich in the cafeteria today."
Jerry Gergich,Let's-- Let's go from the first thing.
Jerry Gergich,"So-- You know what, can we start over?"
Jerry Gergich,Gary Gergich.
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God!"
Jerry Gergich,Sure.
Jerry Gergich,Of course.
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,What's going on?
Jerry Gergich,This is clearly not a sinkhole problem.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, wait a second."
Jerry Gergich,"Whoa, yeah!"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, but I can't even hear anything because of the noise from the copier."
Jerry Gergich,Legally my name is Gary.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I was thinking that we could put this cage thing around it."
Jerry Gergich,This just seems unfair.
Jerry Gergich,Ugh.
Jerry Gergich,You're not our boss.
Jerry Gergich,Whoa.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I don't know when, but she is definitely gonna do it."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, Geez I gotta get dressed."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,Gayle is making a roast.
Jerry Gergich,"Chris, that's great, but you really don't have to do this."
Jerry Gergich,I need my cheaters.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I, for one, am happy to see Tom."
Jerry Gergich,There's only two of us.
Jerry Gergich,Milli's gonna break up with Chris.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, I have to object again."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, what is the big emergency?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, they were out."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, Janet Snakehole belongs to mother Russia now."
Jerry Gergich,Just wish I had more time.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Chris, I hate to pull rank, but if you're going to take a break, would you mind going in the living room, just, you know, so it doesn't disturb everybody else."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, know what, can I go?"
Jerry Gergich,Where did you come from?
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, don't!"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, boy."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God, what do I do?"
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, I didn't get to vote for Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Jerry Gergich,I thought that they close at 8:00.
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no."
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,"Why don't you just go ahead and get your massage, and then hopefully we can get her in for the next thing."
Jerry Gergich,Now I'm off to vote.
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, I handed out 1000 leaflets today."
Jerry Gergich,And since you had said do not tell her the secret under any circumstances--
Jerry Gergich,"And then she yelled at me, and she said she was too busy to come."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, she seemed kind of stressed out."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,I think you--
Jerry Gergich,That is a personal best.
Jerry Gergich,Something very special to show you.
Jerry Gergich,I would love to.
Jerry Gergich,Help.
Jerry Gergich,Please let her win.
Jerry Gergich,"Please, lord, let her win."

Jerry Gergich,What the heck?
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, Leslie, may I borrow you for a second?"
Jerry Gergich,Hello?
Jerry Gergich,See you.
Jerry Gergich,"See you soon, I hope."
Jerry Gergich,Mm-hmm.
Jerry Gergich,Future.
Jerry Gergich,Cheers.
Jerry Gergich,"Hear, hear."
Jerry Gergich,Tonight's kind of a big night.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, who then?"
Jerry Gergich,"Well, we could just tell him the truth that we feel bad that we didn't get him anything nice."
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,Isn't it great? Can you believe that they pay me for this? Because I would do this for free.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh."
Jerry Gergich,Look who's here.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Jerry Gergich,"Sadly, one of our three beautiful angels, Millicent, couldn't be here tonight, but our other two beauties Miriam and Gladys are going to help Gayle and me play a little tune."
Jerry Gergich,"Here we go acaroling, among the leaves so green"
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez!"
Jerry Gergich,"Well, uh, the rehab is grueling"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, that's permanent marker."
Jerry Gergich,I burned in all my names.
Jerry Gergich,Hello?
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,I never thought I'd hear those words from you.
Jerry Gergich,My doctor just said I should avoid--
Jerry Gergich,"No, I don't fully, but my lips are sealed."
Jerry Gergich,It is so wonderful to be part of such a special day.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much for letting me help plan your anniversary.
Jerry Gergich,That's Garry Jerry Larry Gergich Gengurch.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie asked me to post these around the neighborhood.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,I'm eating waffles.
Jerry Gergich,One small pizza for all of us.
Jerry Gergich,With no toppings.
Jerry Gergich,What are you guys talking about?
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,I really-- I didn't know what to do.
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,"Now, you see, the trick with paella is to use just enough saffron to complement the shellfish."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,"So, it's just a fun group."
Jerry Gergich,Isn't that adorable?
Jerry Gergich,"It says ""Property of Pawnee government."""
Jerry Gergich,Look what Gayle made for the baby.
Jerry Gergich,"If you need anything from us, Ron, please just let us know."
Jerry Gergich,Is there at least something to drink?
Jerry Gergich,Just sit on the ground.
Jerry Gergich,Later.
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
Jerry Gergich,"Geez! Get it together, Terry."
Jerry Gergich,That was an accident.
Jerry Gergich,Nobody even told me the pizza was here.
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Jerry Gergich,There's no pizza left?
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Jerry Gergich,I was voting for you in the recall election.
Jerry Gergich,"Good morning, Andy."
Jerry Gergich,Lots of people wearing Leslie Knope buttons.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, Grant Larson is on the phone from the National Park Service."
Jerry Gergich,I've been happily married for 28 years.
Jerry Gergich,It's pretty and it smells good.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, it's really nice."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you don't eat it."
Jerry Gergich,I never told you to eat that.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, the animals know you don't eat the country honeysuckle."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, Grant Larson from the National Park Service is here for your meeting."
Jerry Gergich,"No, don't touch it!"
Jerry Gergich,Okeydokey.
Jerry Gergich,"No, you can't-- Okay, now you'll have to throw that away."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, there we go then."
Jerry Gergich,Let's see what else is here.
Jerry Gergich,You're kidding.
Jerry Gergich,Staying out of the way.
Jerry Gergich,Wow!
Jerry Gergich,There's a quote too.
Jerry Gergich,"You've met my wife, Gayle, many times."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,No!
Jerry Gergich,I miss you guys.
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, listen to me, if there's one thing I've learned"
Jerry Gergich,"I thought I ruined it, but I didn't ruin it."
Jerry Gergich,I didn't ruin it.
Jerry Gergich,They're healthy!
Jerry Gergich,"Well, it's not less."
Jerry Gergich,No?
Jerry Gergich,They are terrific.
Jerry Gergich,They're more than amazing.
Jerry Gergich,"I gota the pizza pizza time, it'sa pizza time!"
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, April, how is that dog park coming?"
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, never fear, because Terry is here."
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, I go by Terry now."
Jerry Gergich,Because there was a guy at National Parks.
Jerry Gergich,"He was already named Larry, so they suggested I go by Terry."
Jerry Gergich,"And then I said my real name is Gary, and they said, ""Who cares?"""
Jerry Gergich,Mmm!
Jerry Gergich,It wasn't me.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, Andy."
Jerry Gergich,My real name is Gary.
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Johnny."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Ron, can we at least have corn on the cob?"
Jerry Gergich,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Jerry Gergich,"I got your park right here, its name is Ramsett Park."
Jerry Gergich,"""Parks and Dolls."""
Jerry Gergich,I have something for ya.
Jerry Gergich,That was you?
Jerry Gergich,"Andy, no."
Jerry Gergich,Andy.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle likes them.
Jerry Gergich,That's my crotch.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,You did good!
Jerry Gergich,It's not.
Jerry Gergich,and God bless you and send you a happy new year and God send you a happy new year
Jerry Gergich,Geez!
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys! I thought you weren't coming."
Jerry Gergich,"I you know, never got your RSVP."
Jerry Gergich,Is that bad?
Jerry Gergich,I don't even know what we're doing.
Jerry Gergich,What do
Jerry Gergich,"You're Well, hey, girls."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Thanks.
Jerry Gergich,It was just farts.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I've got to pick up Gayle at the airport."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, it feels good just to be"
Jerry Gergich,I retired.
Jerry Gergich,I have keys.
Jerry Gergich,Wha
Jerry Gergich,"Well, it's gotta be one of these, right?"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, I'm trying."
Jerry Gergich,It's not this one.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, I'm not good under pressure like this."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,Mm.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you look tired and you're all sweaty."
Jerry Gergich,"""I love you."""
Jerry Gergich,"""I will see you in the car."""
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Get out of here, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,Come on.
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Jerry Gergich,Monster in the window!
Jerry Gergich,She's germing up all my stuff.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie!
Jerry Gergich,"""Please don't grind your teeth too hard when you hear this."""
Jerry Gergich,"""Sorry, but I think we just need to take a break from this work issue."""
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"""Dear honey"" Oh, how sweet."
Jerry Gergich,"Ben couldn't make it, so he asked me to read you this."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, yuck!"
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't fired.
Jerry Gergich,Hey.
Jerry Gergich,The hug machine-- it's firing on all cylinders.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, so it's, you know, kind of like a living document about the town."
Jerry Gergich,I want to show you something.
Jerry Gergich,Here.
Jerry Gergich,It was an all boys school.
Jerry Gergich,I'm great.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, that is really sweet of you, but you don't have to worry about me."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my god well, look."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, she lived in Pawnee all of her life and recorded everything she ever did."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, you're in good shape and you can eat whatever you want."
Jerry Gergich,I really wish I could have your body.
Jerry Gergich,I'll start.
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,I have gone there three times a week for the last 15 years.
Jerry Gergich,It is called Jurassic Fork.
Jerry Gergich,There is a great dinosaur themed restaurant in Patterson.
Jerry Gergich,No!
Jerry Gergich,"No, no."
Jerry Gergich,"No! You also dropped that, clumsy."
Jerry Gergich,These are my mother's diaries.
Jerry Gergich,"I know I didn't achieve all my work goals, but, Leslie, I don't care because for me, the best part about working in the Parks department was that I got to be home every night with my family at 5:00."
Jerry Gergich,The hug machine is here.
Jerry Gergich,"Uhoh, here they are."
Jerry Gergich,Aw.
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.
Jerry Gergich,This is the one.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, have some cheese."
Jerry Gergich,This is
Jerry Gergich,Aw.
Jerry Gergich,I just want to choke him until he passes out.
Jerry Gergich,"Now, that is the fourth time this month."
Jerry Gergich,And Kyle parked his car in my spot again.
Jerry Gergich,Yes!
Jerry Gergich,And Ron Swanson.
Jerry Gergich,That's great.
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
Jerry Gergich,Little Sebastian
Jerry Gergich,"And to me, that's what mattered most."
Jerry Gergich,You can't come in here.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, take a look at that."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that is so sweet that you still write love letters to"
Jerry Gergich,I really hope you can work out your differences.
Jerry Gergich,Hey.
Jerry Gergich,I'd go.
Jerry Gergich,She is trying to find a historical reason to earmark the land for preservation.
Jerry Gergich,"No, I'm sorry, Ben, but there's a page missing from the document."
Jerry Gergich,"So, then, the signatures are invalid."
Jerry Gergich,I didn't have one either!
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, really, it's a funny story."
Jerry Gergich,"So, if I go with you, Ron and Leslie can sign the document separately."
Jerry Gergich,"So two weeks before I married Gayle, I had an emergency appendectomy."
Jerry Gergich,"I signed an oath, Ben."
Jerry Gergich,And then a different notary notarized the oath I signed.
Jerry Gergich,Getting ready for a big press conference.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, that's invalid now."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I met Gayle right here at Sherm's."
Jerry Gergich,She was slender.
Jerry Gergich,"Blonde hair, big breasts, long legs."
Jerry Gergich,You're asking a notary to lie.
Jerry Gergich,"Ugh, not my type at all."
Jerry Gergich,And you're kind and you're thoughtful and you're always such a delight to have around.
Jerry Gergich,That was really something.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah!
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,I'm the luckiest man on earth.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, come on in! It's a party."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh Oh, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,I can see him.
Jerry Gergich,He's right there.
Jerry Gergich,I am sure you are going to be an incredible mother.
Jerry Gergich,How about now?
Jerry Gergich,I want to talk to Ron about the size of my desk.
Jerry Gergich,"No, thanks."
Jerry Gergich,"Not to eavesdrop, but I have a crazy story."
Jerry Gergich,"I recently had a bit of a health scare, just a couple weeks in the hospital."
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, I became really motivated once I got out to finally live life to the fullest."
Jerry Gergich,"So, I fulfilled one of my lifelong dreams, and I became a Notary Public."
Jerry Gergich,"No, I think that's Chris's jacket."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thanks, Sherm."
Jerry Gergich,But you know what?
Jerry Gergich,"Gingrich, Gergich."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.
Jerry Gergich,I wonder if we're related.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, to Ron!"
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Look what Ron made.
Jerry Gergich,It's amazing.
Jerry Gergich,Would you just sign right here? And I will need your thumbprints.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, they've always butted heads, but I really I don't think they hate each other."
Jerry Gergich,I just think they're very different people and they've just drifted apart once they stopped working in the same office.
Jerry Gergich,"Good luck, you guys."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, whoa!"
Jerry Gergich,"April, there's no paper in the printer."
Jerry Gergich,So that's the one thing you do.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I thought you said the Gergich party."
Jerry Gergich,"You're up, Andy."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Jerry Gergich,"And look, you can just about see my head."
Jerry Gergich,A picture of me officiating Leslie and Ben's wedding.
Jerry Gergich,It's been more like heaven for me.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, what a day."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm a big fan, Mr. Luck."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Notary publics can trace our origin all the way back to ancient Rome.
Jerry Gergich,Calvin Coolidge was a notary.
Jerry Gergich,Mmmhmm.
Jerry Gergich,And so was Calvin Coolidge's dad and so was Calvin Coolidge's paternal grandfather.
Jerry Gergich,It's 2.5 pounds of pressure is what you need to get the perfect stamp.
Jerry Gergich,"This monthly-- Well, it's a notary email newsletter."
Jerry Gergich,"And, oh, my gosh."
Jerry Gergich,"Ben, it's fun."
Jerry Gergich,It's just fun.
Jerry Gergich,Maybe she owns a juice bar in Snerling.
Jerry Gergich,Very good.
Jerry Gergich,"Look what we have here, country honeysuckle, Pawnee style."
Jerry Gergich,"One, it's poisonous."
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of scary.
Jerry Gergich,I'm just not used to people from the office asking me things.
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,Why do you want to know?
Jerry Gergich,They're good.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, wonderful."
Jerry Gergich,"According to her, it's the best view."
Jerry Gergich,"But in a good way, though."
Jerry Gergich,She likes to stand behind me and watch.
Jerry Gergich,We had dinner together.
Jerry Gergich,He seemed okay.
Jerry Gergich,I didn't know that!
Jerry Gergich,I was trying to keep it hush-hush.
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of embarrassing.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, earlier today, I was licking icing off of my finger, and then, boom, I swallow my wedding ring."
Jerry Gergich,"Here you go, Chief."
Jerry Gergich,Gayle always has me do the windshield.
Jerry Gergich,"And I wish I could say it was the first time, butâ¦"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,"Didn't I, Ben?"
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys."
Jerry Gergich,Do you remember the time when you put sleeping pills in my soda?
Jerry Gergich,I fell right over in the middle of a town hall meeting.
Jerry Gergich,You made a video of it and showed it at my birthday party.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, it went over really big."
Jerry Gergich,That's very sweet.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, um, I have got an itch that I have not been able to get to all day, and even against the wall, nothing will do it."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I really ripped one."
Jerry Gergich,Would you mind doing that?
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, please, can you keep it down? Or at least research how to deliver a baby that's coming out face up."
Jerry Gergich,Go up the back.
Jerry Gergich,Lay the mother on her side and try to move the baby in a corkscrew fashion.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, I will Photoshop his face."
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,It's in your best interest.
Jerry Gergich,"Justâ¦ if you could, like okay, go up."
Jerry Gergich,"Look, I was doublechecking all the paperwork that Tom gave me in that super fun parking lot, and there was something about Harvey's corporate structure that just seemed fishy."
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no, I mean, can it be painful?"
Jerry Gergich,It's just a matter of getting out the old colander.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"Look, I was on my way to feed the hummingbirds, and I stopped for a breakfast burrito."
Jerry Gergich,I really dislocated my shoulder.
Jerry Gergich,This is real.
Jerry Gergich,Correct.
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't mugged.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,"And Lord Sheldon, he lunged at a bird, I dropped the burrito, and it landed on a log in the creek."
Jerry Gergich,This is gonna be the happiest time of your life!
Jerry Gergich,Tent world?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, how else would I do it?"
Jerry Gergich,What's bookmarks?
Jerry Gergich,It happened right over there.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"They sent you Tshirts, too."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, let me grab my lunch."
Jerry Gergich,"Sure, but the good news is, I've gotten very good at passing it."
Jerry Gergich,"So, I go to reach for it, I lose my balance, and I fall on my shoulder really weird."
Jerry Gergich,Are you kidding me? Imagine what Tom would have said.
Jerry Gergich,"And I am going to get myself a stack of mystery novels, a box of cigars, and I am going to sit back and enjoy my life."
Jerry Gergich,"And the wife and I, we have bought a little cottage on a lake."
Jerry Gergich,Because two more years until I retire with full benefits and pension.
Jerry Gergich,They can laugh at me all they want.
Jerry Gergich,Go ahead.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, geez."
Jerry Gergich,I love a peppermint--
Jerry Gergich,"Gayle and I have kept everything our girls ever used, so we have, like, millions of clothes and strollers and-- just don't buy a thing, okay?"
Jerry Gergich,Seriously? My goodness.
Jerry Gergich,I will finish my sandwich and enjoy the view.
Jerry Gergich,Sounds good.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle made it for me.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Geez, I've been up all night trying to make sure--"
Jerry Gergich,Shut the--
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God!"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now listen to me, you two."
Jerry Gergich,Hmm.
Jerry Gergich,So I dug around and it turns out he has got a lot of code violations.
Jerry Gergich,Couldn't agree more.
Jerry Gergich,"You did it, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you know what?"
Jerry Gergich,My phone has 25 lines.
Jerry Gergich,I think it might be a switchboard.
Jerry Gergich,Everyone else has one line.
Jerry Gergich,Will do.
Jerry Gergich,"What does ""laked"" mean?"
Jerry Gergich,Hello?
Jerry Gergich,Do you guys know how to dissolve super glue?
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I would be happy to go back into retirement if you have to cut the staff."
Jerry Gergich,Can't I just work from home?
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, do you need help with anything?"
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, but Chipp McCapp's manager called."
Jerry Gergich,He has to drop out.
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Jerry Gergich,Pawnee Cares.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I don't feel good."
Jerry Gergich,Mmmhmm.
Jerry Gergich,Geez.
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, please."
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,Somebody forgot a banana in here ooh!
Jerry Gergich,Oh ho!
Jerry Gergich,"I said, ""Gayle, put that bikini away, because Pawnee needs me."""
Jerry Gergich,"Well, when Leslie called to see if I could help, Gayle and I were just getting on a cruise ship to the Bahamas."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, everybody."
Jerry Gergich,Please leave your message after the tone.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,"Come on, April, it's already hard enough for my family when you call me ""Gary."""
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's Gary."
Jerry Gergich,It's Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's not Larry."
Jerry Gergich,"And as long as we're starting out fresh, Leslie, I was wondering if people would call me by my real name."
Jerry Gergich,"Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Larry Gengurch."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, it's the middle of the night."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank God."
Jerry Gergich,You broke my egg.
Jerry Gergich,"No, but I'm a very good piano player."
Jerry Gergich,I'd be happy to go up there and give it a shot.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm trying to find my inhaler, 'cause I'm having a littleâ¦"

Jerry Gergich,"Well, you know, to each his own, but you guys really seem like you're in love."

Jerry Gergich,"You got it, boss."
Jerry Gergich,I thought you said on the phone it was a reception.
Jerry Gergich,That is the set of tumblers that I got from the registry.
Jerry Gergich,"Ah, Geez."
Jerry Gergich,I kind of thought I'd be holding a piece of wood or something.

Jerry Gergich,Come on in.
Jerry Gergich,Have breakfast with the family.
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,Your purse is shaped like a waffle.
Jerry Gergich,Mmmm.
Jerry Gergich,"Girls, we've got company."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"You were the one who let him out, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now, stop trying to blame me."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, I am going to go and say goodbye to some other folks."
Jerry Gergich,She made a meatloaf.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I really appreciate this, but I did promise Gayle I would leave by 5:00."
Jerry Gergich,Right now?
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, hey, hey."
Jerry Gergich,Did you find him?
Jerry Gergich,"It's okay, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,Come on.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm! Turkey's great.
Jerry Gergich,But thank you.
Jerry Gergich,Hey!
Jerry Gergich,Thank you for trying.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, thank you."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,He was the mayor at the time.
Jerry Gergich,I've always wanted to meet him.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, today you're getting that chance."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"I just wish I had a chance to meet him, you know, years ago before all the scandals and his death."
Jerry Gergich,But this is nice too.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, It's Terry now."
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, actually, I have an announcement, too."
Jerry Gergich,Butterflies.
Jerry Gergich,"Hello, Mr. Mayor."
Jerry Gergich,"First of all, I'm so sorry that those Serbian mobsters shoved you out of that helicopter."
Jerry Gergich,You deserve better.
Jerry Gergich,It's really been nice to meet you.
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
Jerry Gergich,"She has a tasty surprise waiting for me, if you know what I mean."
Jerry Gergich,The honor is all mine.
Jerry Gergich,"But this trip, it is the one time of year I get to pee standing up."
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, she--"
Jerry Gergich,"Ooh, uh What's that?"
Jerry Gergich,And each dot is a photo of a citizen of the town.
Jerry Gergich,Yay!
Jerry Gergich,It's pointillism.
Jerry Gergich,I just wanted to show you my art.
Jerry Gergich,Stop it.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you were the one watching him."
Jerry Gergich,"Wow, Duraflex cuttop A350s in deep maroon?"
Jerry Gergich,"She... No, I didn't."
Jerry Gergich,"For my murinal, I was inspired by the death of my grandma."
Jerry Gergich,It really is.
Jerry Gergich,"No, what are do gonna you?"
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,You know Gayle gives me a gift each and every day.
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,"Hey, sugar butt."
Jessica Wicks,"Some lardos in Muncie ate tainted Sweetums toffee sticks and diarrhea'd so much, they ended up in the hospital."
Jessica Wicks,"We also replaced some of the sconces, got rid of the furniture, painted these floors black."
Jessica Wicks,"Can we give their school, like, a new seesaw or something?"
Jessica Wicks,They were all scratched up.
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,"I mean, I thought Trish was just adorable."
Jessica Wicks,What is there to talk about?
Jessica Wicks,Miami Teal is Nicky's favorite color.
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,And you have so much money.
Jessica Wicks,I will.
Jessica Wicks,I just love it!
Jessica Wicks,Oh!
Jessica Wicks,"And we started talking, and then I realized who he was."
Jessica Wicks,Okay.
Jessica Wicks,Whoo!
Jessica Wicks,"I was doing a ribbon cutting at the hospital, and he was there because his blood doesn't work."
Jessica Wicks,If you're not the most charming man in Indiana.
Jessica Wicks,Tom Haverford.
Jessica Wicks,It truly is.
Jessica Wicks,Sweetums is excited to propose an alternative to boring municipal water.
Jessica Wicks,How are you?
Jessica Wicks,Of course!
Jessica Wicks,Leslie Knorp.
Jessica Wicks,"Hi, I'm Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994."
Jessica Wicks,"Look, we all love T-Dazzle."
Jessica Wicks,"I'll take care of this, love nut."
Jessica Wicks,Thanks.
Jessica Wicks,"And when you make your apology, I want you to wear a limegreen pantsuit because it will look horrible on you."
Jessica Wicks,"We got a board meeting, Sugarbutt."
Jessica Wicks,"These were a gift from your British friend, Lord Edgar Covington."
Jessica Wicks,"We call it ""Drinkems""!"
Jessica Wicks,Hi.
Jessica Wicks,"Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994."
Jessica Wicks,"Ooh, I like you!"
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, boo-hoo! It all ran off into the lake."
Jessica Wicks,You little devil.
Jessica Wicks,He was very impressed with you two.
Jessica Wicks,The Newports made this town.
Jessica Wicks,I should just pay you to follow me around.
Jessica Wicks,I've had to look at that ugly thing all day long.
Jessica Wicks,To hang my birthday present to Nicky.
Jessica Wicks,Mmm-hmm.
Jessica Wicks,"Morning, cutie."
Jessica Wicks,The demolition people couldn't get here until this afternoon.
Jessica Wicks,Don't remind me.
Jessica Wicks,Don't tell me about Pawnee history.
Jessica Wicks,I did you a favor.
Jessica Wicks,He sounded rich on the phone.
Jessica Wicks,"And tonight, we're gonna celebrate my husband's 85th birthday, without this mushy old pile of rot."
Jessica Wicks,You Gryzzl guys are a real hoot.
Jessica Wicks,Come on in here.
Jessica Wicks,That's you! Come on.
Jessica Wicks,"Come on, Sugarbutt!"
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, my."
Jessica Wicks,"No, I named that dog Spaghettios, and he just pooped in your briefcase."
Jessica Wicks,I'll show you guys what we did in the sitting room.
Jessica Wicks,Whoo!
Jessica Wicks,"Uh-oh, Spaghettios."
Jessica Wicks,Is this a circle? Or is it an O?
Jessica Wicks,Is Oprah involved in your bid?
Jessica Wicks,"One, two, three!"
Jessica Wicks,Oh! That's the part I don't like.
Jessica Wicks,How much was her bid again?
Jessica Wicks,I think he was calling me from a helicopter.
Jessica Wicks,"You were a stick-in-the-mud when we judged that beauty pageant, and you're being a stick-in-the-mud now."
Jessica Wicks,You're next.
Jessica Wicks,We are so excited to have you working with us here at the allnew Sweetums Foundation.
Jessica Wicks,It is.
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, my gosh!"
Jessica Wicks,Well You know what they say about rumors.
Jessica Wicks,"It's a little late for that, sweetheart."
Jessica Wicks,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Jessica Wicks,I told them what I was doing months ago.
Jessica Wicks,So we are officially jumping the gun and selling to Gryzzl for $125 million.
Jessica Wicks,"Where I come from, there's a saying, ""What's done is done."""
Jessica Wicks,Sweetums' public image is currently at an alltime low.
Jessica Wicks,I need you to select your first charity by tomorrow.
Jessica Wicks,Uh-huh.
Jessica Wicks,Let me repeat that because it makes me very horny.
Jessica Wicks,This is your office.
Jessica Wicks,"Thank you, sweetie!"
Jessica Wicks,"So, between money and Leslie... You see the bind that I'm in?"
Jessica Wicks,He was so decrepit.
Jessica Wicks,"Sweetie, all the money we spend on the foundation is tax deductible."
Jessica Wicks,$125 million.
Jessica Wicks,My late husband.
Jessica Wicks,They're mostly true.
Jessica Wicks,"Ah, yes."
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,Please leave!
Jessica Wicks,You are such an autumn.
Jessica Wicks,"Last week, the Newport Trust told Gryzzl, in no uncertain terms, that we would not do business with a company that invades our privacy."
Jessica Wicks,Yay!
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, I forgot! It's Fondue Friday."
Jessica Wicks,We can release a publicity shot of a bucktoothed hayseed taking medicine for the first time in his life.
Jessica Wicks,The redneck ambulance is a great choice.
Jessica Wicks,"I want you to say that we're a moral, upstanding corporation that you're proud to have in Pawnee."
Jessica Wicks,I want you to formally apologize for what you said about Sweetums.
Jessica Wicks,All better.
Jessica Wicks,Oh!
Jessica Wicks,There is a smudge on my tail.
Jessica Wicks,"Then, Gryzzl upped their offer to $125 million, and I swear to God, y'all, I nearly fainted."
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, would you look at that."
Jessica Wicks,It's where all the flavor comes from.
Jessica Wicks,It was love at first sight!
Jessica Wicks,What are you gonna do?
Jessica Wicks,Go.
Jessica Wicks,"Loving smiles and smiling tears, The midnight of my heart is you."
Jessica Wicks,Get yourself a matching nude portrait? I can call the painter.
Jessica Wicks,But we can do more to improve our drinking supply.
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, I packed a suitcase."
Jessica Wicks,Leslie doesn't pay for my lifestyle.
Jessica Wicks,"I know that Bobby Newport is my stepson, but the work you did on Leslie's campaign was amazing."
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,And I think Trish is a no-brainer.
Jessica Wicks,Any interest in running it?
Jessica Wicks,"Actually, speaking of, we're starting up a nonprofit foundation to restore our name."
Jessica Wicks,People died.
Jessica Wicks,And money pays for my lifestyle.
Jessica Wicks,But I also like money.
Jessica Wicks,The company's laying low right now due to a small mishap.
Jessica Wicks,"I'm really sorry, cutie."
Jessica Wicks,"Well, I must say it's a much better idea than the last one you had, that gourmet French food thing."
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, Leslie, I have always liked you."
Jessica Wicks,I am just-- I am so happy for me!
Jessica Wicks,I know!
Jessica Wicks,Trevor says it'll probably be around $90 million.
Jessica Wicks,"Look, I am the only one here who has entered and won this contest in the past."
Jessica Wicks,Money does.
Jessica Wicks,Your name is on our short list.
Jill Biden,You're just mad because you lost.
Jill Biden,No shop talk.
Jill Biden,"I'm looking at you, Leslie."
Jill Biden,"So, if you want to discuss politics, you're going to have to wait until after dinner."
Jill Biden,"As usual, there is only one rule."
Jim Irsay,"You're big enough to play football yourself, it looks like to me."
Jim Irsay,This whole place is yours.
Jim Irsay,Who is ready to play 60?
Jim Irsay,"Andy, good to meet you, my friend."
Jim Kabernick,"Yes, that's true."
Jim Kabernick,"Leslie, for God's sake, we're on TV."
Jim Kabernick,Why why did you bring that up? I said yes.
Joan Callamezzo,An incompetent government run amok?
Joan Callamezzo,Let's go ahead.
Joan Callamezzo,That's sweet.
Joan Callamezzo,Thank you.
Joan Callamezzo,Let's get some shots of chipped paint and crying babies.
Joan Callamezzo,Is it revenge of the Wamapoke?
Joan Callamezzo,Or probably something even worse than any of those things?
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, how big of a disaster will this be on a scale of nine to ten?"
Joan Callamezzo,You're pretty soft yourself.
Joan Callamezzo,"No, Joan Callamezzo."
Joan Callamezzo,"But sadly, I cannot."
Joan Callamezzo,It's the curse.
Joan Callamezzo,"We have a controversial topic today, the gay penguin marriage at the Pawnee Zoo."
Joan Callamezzo,They're pretty good.
Joan Callamezzo,Perd Hapley is here today.
Joan Callamezzo,"You know, I really would make an incredible mayor."
Joan Callamezzo,"Or, as Perd would say, ""My name is Perd Hapley, and the person I see here today is me."""
Joan Callamezzo,You know what?
Joan Callamezzo,Oh.
Joan Callamezzo,Because I'm only 27 years old.
Joan Callamezzo,Full of ideas here today.
Joan Callamezzo,"Wow, look at that! Wow, we're lighting up here."
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh!
Joan Callamezzo,Gotcha.
Joan Callamezzo,"Okay, you know the drill."
Joan Callamezzo,"Can you say, ""big whoop""?"
Joan Callamezzo,"You keep up those funnies, I'm gonna have to invite you over for supper."
Joan Callamezzo,I have to say that that stunt that you did with the penguins was clearly over the line.
Joan Callamezzo,"Now, Marcia, what, if anything, can Miss Knope do to make it right?"
Joan Callamezzo,Of course not.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Joan Callamezzo,Oh! You must.
Joan Callamezzo,How about some of those spooky traffic lights?
Joan Callamezzo,Good!
Joan Callamezzo,I've never seen that on our show before.
Joan Callamezzo,We've got a new intro to do.
Joan Callamezzo,Keep those cameras up.
Joan Callamezzo,That's exactly what it is.
Joan Callamezzo,"While it seemed everything was ready for tomorrow, things aren't always exactly as they may seem."
Joan Callamezzo,And that is a fact.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, there Push that, and--"
Joan Callamezzo,You're on the air!
Joan Callamezzo,"Miss Knope, how do you respond?"
Joan Callamezzo,"So, Marcia, what is all the fuss about?"
Joan Callamezzo,Mmmhmm.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, that's your opinion."
Joan Callamezzo,Guess who?
Joan Callamezzo,Murder.
Joan Callamezzo,Curse?
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, I'm not sure what that has to do with the mugging."
Joan Callamezzo,"Now, I understand that you have a bombshell to drop that you are just sitting on."
Joan Callamezzo,Ranger Carl Lorthner is here today.
Joan Callamezzo,How many of these carnies are illegals?
Joan Callamezzo,The Ramsett Park mugging story continues with a shiny new twist.
Joan Callamezzo,When was the last time this giant wheel of death was inspected?
Joan Callamezzo,"Tonight, we're hoping the people of Pawnee dig their big, chubby hands into their plus-size pockets and donate generously."
Joan Callamezzo,"I don't think I'm being unprofessional, I was really hoping for more tawdry scandals."
Joan Callamezzo,"No, he's not."
Joan Callamezzo,"What about your friend Ben, here?"
Joan Callamezzo,We all know his story.
Joan Callamezzo,"One of failure, remind us of that failure."
Joan Callamezzo,Stop it.
Joan Callamezzo,Yikes.
Joan Callamezzo,"And now, you're involved with this."
Joan Callamezzo,"Do I smell another disaster, hopefully?"
Joan Callamezzo,"Beautiful, but deadly."
Joan Callamezzo,"I'm a reporter, not your therapist."
Joan Callamezzo,Is that Pawnee corn or Eagleton corn?
Joan Callamezzo,Uh... Leslie.
Joan Callamezzo,Counterpoint.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Joan Callamezzo,Diabetes.
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Joan Callamezzo,Good.
Joan Callamezzo,Tom!
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Joan Callamezzo,You got Little Sebastian?
Joan Callamezzo,Are you [bleep] kidding me?
Joan Callamezzo,You got Tilda?
Joan Callamezzo,Yuck.
Joan Callamezzo,"You just love flashing your ass, don't you?"
Joan Callamezzo,Wow.
Joan Callamezzo,You want to go eat something?
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, no, no, no."
Joan Callamezzo,Go on.
Joan Callamezzo,Go.
Joan Callamezzo,Get out of my sight.
Joan Callamezzo,"Do you know that I bumped a cat that can stand up on its hinders for you? You disgust me, Knope."
Joan Callamezzo,This is Pawnee [bleep] Today.
Joan Callamezzo,Don't you ever [bleep] me like that again.
Joan Callamezzo,That segment was a disaster.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, things are really heating up in here, aren't they? We should probably take some calls."
Joan Callamezzo,Don't make me chase you.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Joan Callamezzo,I'm Pawnee Today's Joan Callamezzo.
Joan Callamezzo,Good evening and welcome to the tenth annual Pawnee Cares Diabetes Telethon.
Joan Callamezzo,We've all heard the old saying.
Joan Callamezzo,Shame on Shakira's sheets.
Joan Callamezzo,Shaquille showered.
Joan Callamezzo,Murder the most melons.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, thanks for noticing."
Joan Callamezzo,The Harvest Festival starts at 9:00 a.m tomorrow morning.
Joan Callamezzo,"And as far as this reporter is concerned, it's well worth your time."
Joan Callamezzo,"It pains me to say this, but great job here."
Joan Callamezzo,Welcome to Pawnee Today.
Joan Callamezzo,Oh!
Joan Callamezzo,I am first rate newswoman Joan Callamezzo.
Joan Callamezzo,That's an all time low.
Joan Callamezzo,Yuck.
Joan Callamezzo,Sorry?
Joan Callamezzo,What is this about a curse?
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, the city council has done very little over the past few years, and what they have accomplished, in my opinion, has been embarrassing."
Joan Callamezzo,Give it up for Leslie Knope.
Joan Callamezzo,"""Because you're about to wet yourself from laughter."
Joan Callamezzo,"Strap on your adult diapers, everyone."
Joan Callamezzo,Our next guest has asked me to read this.
Joan Callamezzo,Pawnee's City Council approval rate is at a dismal 3%.
Joan Callamezzo,Thank you.
Joan Callamezzo,"""Parks are supposed to be fun."""
Joan Callamezzo,Leslie Knope is with us again from the Parks Department.
Joan Callamezzo,Don't blow it.
Joan Callamezzo,This is Local Access 46.
Joan Callamezzo,It's nice to see you again.
Joan Callamezzo,This isn't CSPAN.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay?
Joan Callamezzo,Where are you from originally?
Joan Callamezzo,Hi.
Joan Callamezzo,We'll see.
Joan Callamezzo,But we'll see.
Joan Callamezzo,"But sometimes, muggers have their own ideas."
Joan Callamezzo,Not as easy as it looks.
Joan Callamezzo,Looks like a very impressive festival.
Joan Callamezzo,"Hello, Leslie."
Joan Callamezzo,Cut the chatter.
Joan Callamezzo,"Up next, 10 objects you didn't know you can eat."
Joan Callamezzo,And not bad.
Joan Callamezzo,To make it right.
Joan Callamezzo,"So, what is the solution to fix this?"
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, tell us your story."
Joan Callamezzo,"So, Leslie, I hear you're going to be in front of the camera this year."
Joan Callamezzo,Telehosting?
Joan Callamezzo,"No, it means ""flower."""
Joan Callamezzo,"@munchmeat2015 asks, ""Pawnee used 2 b safe."
Joan Callamezzo,I have been thinking of rebranding myself.
Joan Callamezzo,"On a completely unrelated note, I have horrible allergies."
Joan Callamezzo,It just finished up an hour ago.
Joan Callamezzo,I went on a booze cruise last week.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yeah, listen, I'm a little under the weather."
Joan Callamezzo,What do you think about Juan Callamezzo?
Joan Callamezzo,All right?
Joan Callamezzo,Let me go change into something more tantalizing.
Joan Callamezzo,"But I am, first and foremost, a journalist."
Joan Callamezzo,"Sorry, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,We wanted her to sign the gotcha wall.
Joan Callamezzo,Did Leslie leave?
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, did you at least get Buddy Holly to sing?"
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, it would be my pleasure."
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, my goodness, we are back with America's greatest leader Annabel Porter and her new favorite artisan, local woodworker Ron Swanson."
Joan Callamezzo,You said your name was Glenn?
Joan Callamezzo,"Victoria Herzog, you were a successful attorney from Wilmington, Delaware."
Joan Callamezzo,Then you hit rock bottom.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, Erik, if you didn't give it to me, then who did?"
Joan Callamezzo,We will pull out the world map and speculate wildly.
Joan Callamezzo,"Thank you, Commissioner Gordon, people of Gotham."
Joan Callamezzo,After the break: Where was Leslie Knope actually born?
Joan Callamezzo,"People often ask me, ""Joan, how do you do it?"""
Joan Callamezzo,It's simple.
Joan Callamezzo,In what way?
Joan Callamezzo,I love being on TV.
Joan Callamezzo,I've known what I've wanted to do since I was 10 years old.
Joan Callamezzo,That is the key to living a good life.
Joan Callamezzo,"And because you lied about it, we cannot make this a book club selection."
Joan Callamezzo,Gotcha!
Joan Callamezzo,That's pretty.
Joan Callamezzo,"If you don't absolutely love what you do with a true passion, then what's the point in doing it at all?"
Joan Callamezzo,Yeah.
Joan Callamezzo,I'm a true professional.
Joan Callamezzo,We gotta go.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, no, no."
Joan Callamezzo,"All right, let's burn this candle."
Joan Callamezzo,Crap.
Joan Callamezzo,If you know what I mean.
Joan Callamezzo,I'm gonna go powder my nose Amongst other things.
Joan Callamezzo,I can honestly say today's guest is the only person in this town who's a bigger deal than I am.
Joan Callamezzo,Please welcome lifestyle guru Annabel Porter.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, you are."
Joan Callamezzo,"Can I just say, as a journalist, I feel like we're best friends."
Joan Callamezzo,Tell the audience about yourself.
Joan Callamezzo,Today's show will not go on.
Joan Callamezzo,Oh.
Joan Callamezzo,"Annabel, what trends are Pardon the pun, but Trending?"
Joan Callamezzo,Don't worry about me.
Joan Callamezzo,"Drink up, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,Don't make any promises you can't keep.
Joan Callamezzo,Hello. I'm Joan Callamezzo.
Joan Callamezzo,"Things have changed, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,"I'm like a caged peacock, yearning for the wind on her haunches."
Joan Callamezzo,I'm a woman with a strong sexual appetite.
Joan Callamezzo,Of course.
Joan Callamezzo,Thank God.
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh.
Joan Callamezzo,It's actually quite liberating.
Joan Callamezzo,Ron Swanson is here.
Joan Callamezzo,Santino and I are divorcing.
Joan Callamezzo,"He will be joining us after the break, so stick around."
Joan Callamezzo,The show must go on.
Joan Callamezzo,"When I was 18, Val Kilmer saw me at a mall and told me I should model."
Joan Callamezzo,"I'll have another drink, and so will this adorable hunk of caramel to my right."
Joan Callamezzo,"We received a tip that you, Leslie ""born and raised"" Knope, were not born in Pawnee."
Joan Callamezzo,Not so fast.
Joan Callamezzo,"No, no, no."
Joan Callamezzo,That's nice.
Joan Callamezzo,I see you brought your girlfriend for support.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, sure."
Joan Callamezzo,It is a veritable storm of information coming into the studios here today.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, of course."
Joan Callamezzo,...with Leslie Knope.
Joan Callamezzo,We have pictures of City Councilman Dexhartâ¦
Joan Callamezzo,We just received these exclusive photos.
Joan Callamezzo,Wow.
Joan Callamezzo,Mmmhmm.
Joan Callamezzo,"And he's now about to shake hands with Leslie Knope, the alleged sex toy."
Joan Callamezzo,We're looking at Councilman Dexhartâ¦
Joan Callamezzo,This is back in April 2005.
Joan Callamezzo,We are here looking at a videotape.
Joan Callamezzo,Sex.
Joan Callamezzo,"And I am legendary newswoman Joan Callamezzo, newly single."
Joan Callamezzo,Would your affiliation with big business affect your decisions as a city councilor?
Joan Callamezzo,"Uh, some not me have criticized your involvement with your father's candy company Sweetums."
Joan Callamezzo,This last question before the break is for Mr. Newport
Joan Callamezzo,"Once again, Brandi and Leslie are essentially the same person."
Joan Callamezzo,Well said.
Joan Callamezzo,"Uh, just a reminder to our candidates to keep it civil."
Joan Callamezzo,"Looking at you, Leslie."
Joan Callamezzo,"Mr. Newport, rebuttal."
Joan Callamezzo,Why is Ramsett Park so filthy and awful?
Joan Callamezzo,This question is about Pawnee's park system.
Joan Callamezzo,Leslie Knope.
Joan Callamezzo,"""What will u do ""2 make Pawnee safe & can u help me find my car?"
Joan Callamezzo,"""Some1 stole my car."
Joan Callamezzo,"This question about public safety comes from Twitter because apparently, that's something that happens now."
Joan Callamezzo,It's time for opening statements.
Joan Callamezzo,"Drugs, possibly."
Joan Callamezzo,Rock and Roll?
Joan Callamezzo,"We'll find out, on Pawnee Today's exclusive interview with the woman at the center of the Dexhart sex scandal, Leslie Knope."
Joan Callamezzo,"On a separate note, I think that America should have a purge night."
Joan Callamezzo,Let me explain why.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, hang on"
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh.
Joan Callamezzo,Where is it now?
Joan Callamezzo,Back here?
Joan Callamezzo,Where over here?
Joan Callamezzo,Uh Oh Whoa!
Joan Callamezzo,"Which, when applied, legally determines the newest selection of Joan's book club."
Joan Callamezzo,"And also, in this hand, right here, I have a sticker."
Joan Callamezzo,I have it right here.
Joan Callamezzo,"You're a real native of Pawnee, aren't you?"
Joan Callamezzo,"So, Leslie."
Joan Callamezzo,"We'll see, won't we?"
Joan Callamezzo,Nope.
Joan Callamezzo,Joan Callamezzo.
Joan Callamezzo,Hi.
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, my first question has to be, when did the affair start?"
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, Leslie, we all saw the tape from four years ago, and you were flashing some serious ""do me"" eyes."
Joan Callamezzo,That's just my opinion.
Joan Callamezzo,You know what? That's a really good idea.
Joan Callamezzo,"Let's bring him out! Councilman, come on out!"
Joan Callamezzo,I thought it'd be more exciting!
Joan Callamezzo,"Yeah, the uppers are kicking in."
Joan Callamezzo,It's like I'm invisible.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, I guess it's your word against his."
Joan Callamezzo,Is this happening? Wait.
Joan Callamezzo,There's no mole.
Joan Callamezzo,There is no mole.
Joan Callamezzo,"This exclusive story, there is no mole on Miss Knope!"
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, Councilman? Care to make a comment about No-Mole-Gate?"
Joan Callamezzo,Councilman?
Joan Callamezzo,"Just took some ludes to kind of smooth it out, so I'm right in that sweet spot."
Joan Callamezzo,"Can I just say-- And I think this is really important, so I need everyone to shut up-- I love your hair."
Joan Callamezzo,I don't think so.
Joan Callamezzo,"Take me home, dumpling."
Joan Callamezzo,It's beddy time.
Joan Callamezzo,I wanna take you both home and [bleep] bend you over and just [bleep].
Joan Callamezzo,Whoo!
Joan Callamezzo,"It's a tumbler of gin, and it's got crushed aspirin around the rim."
Joan Callamezzo,I'll have the Joan.
Joan Callamezzo,Hi.
Joan Callamezzo,Tommy!
Joan Callamezzo,She is head of the group Women Against Feminism.
Joan Callamezzo,Let's turn now to Sasha Dunkirk.
Joan Callamezzo,Let's hear it for the boys Whoo!
Joan Callamezzo,"Got about 20 minutes before I either get really tired or really horny, so let's roll."
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh.
Joan Callamezzo,Yes.
Joan Callamezzo,I know that.
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Joan Callamezzo,Will this medium drink of water be there?
Joan Callamezzo,Of course.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, thank you for getting me home last night."
Joan Callamezzo,"I wasn't, uh, feeling very well."
Joan Callamezzo,Because of some bad seafood that I ate.
Joan Callamezzo,"What? Well, that is worse than I ever could have hoped for."
Joan Callamezzo,So you're defending Leslie Knope?
Joan Callamezzo,Bring it.
Joan Callamezzo,At the same time.
Joan Callamezzo,But at what cost?
Joan Callamezzo,Did you bribe them to be here?
Joan Callamezzo,Money?
Joan Callamezzo,"Never, ever would have thought of that."
Joan Callamezzo,"Hello, and welcome to Pawnee Today."
Joan Callamezzo,"Tom, I'm already married."
Joan Callamezzo,That's rude.
Joan Callamezzo,How many cities does Ben Wyatt need to destroy before he's put behind bars?
Joan Callamezzo,Jumping right in.
Joan Callamezzo,So what is the secret sauce that we should all be putting on our marriage burgers?
Joan Callamezzo,"Today's guest is Leslie Knope, who is here to tell us how this year's Harvest Festival is going to bankrupt the city."
Joan Callamezzo,Ahh.
Joan Callamezzo,Tell us how you first met.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yeah, my show, my questions."
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Joan Callamezzo,Why don't you?
Joan Callamezzo,I stole my gym teacher's husband.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, great question."
Joan Callamezzo,"Doug and Rosie DeMarco,"
Joan Callamezzo,I'm Joan Callamezzo.
Joe,Mmmhmm?
Joe,Mmm.
Joe,"April, we couldn't be happier and you are an angel for asking."
Joe,Ooh!
Joe,It sold in two hours?
Joe,"Oh, my gosh, Donna has told me so much about you."
Joe,"But but for real, though."
Joe,Where are we going?
Joe,It's nice to put a face to the name.
Joe,"Well, I gotta get back to my classroom."
Joe,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Ron."
Joe,"And if either of you guys need anything at all today, please do not hesitate to ask, okay?"
Joe,What?
Joe,Okay.
Joe,"Oh, my gosh."
Joe,"Barbara, don't even mention it."
Joe,"Look, I hate it when my students are upset, so I just went out, driving around."
Joe,I checked a few neighborhood parks.
Joe,It took barely six hours.
Joe,No need.
Joe,Would you like a muffin?
Joe,Wow.
Joe,These kids are so lucky to have your fashion expertise.
Joe,Oh!
Joe,It's really nice to see you.
Joe,I'm sorry.
Joe,I'm sorry.
Joe,"I'm so sorry, Craig."
Joe,No?
Joe,"Because orchids are Donna's favorite flowers, and she's my favorite flower."
Joe,"We're going to have orchids on the all the pews, right?"
Joe,"Baby, this is really generous."
Joe,"Terry, what's happening?"
Joe,Still unclear.
Joe,Not an answer to my question.
Joe,But I love our trips.
Joe,"So, what's happening?"
Joe,I still don't know what's happening.
Joe,What what's happening?
Joe,"And honestly, it's your money."
Joe,Thank you so much for helping out.
Joe,You're going to buy me a bunch of leather handbags?
Joe,What are you doing here?
Joe,"Well, it can't beat last year."
Joe,"I mean, Middle Korea is so beautiful."
Joe,I like the vanilla one with the lemon cream.
Joe,"Donna, how are you?"
Joe,"Honestly, with the way work is going, I just need this right now."
Joe,The school cut the math club.
Joe,What's going on?
Joe,And math.
Joe,Yeah.
Joe,You should spend it how you want.
Joe,They just don't teach math anymore.
Joe,"Yes, the red thing."
Joe,"Here, let me get this."
Joe,April!
Joe,I made them last night.
Joe,"You're welcome, guys."
Joe,I love it.
Joe,Oh.
Joe,To Ben.
Joe,And I love you.
Joe,"You are an amazing, confident woman."
Joe,"Just yesterday I learned that the Pearl Jam album, Vitalogy was written about you."
Joe,"Even though I've known you for years, I feel like I learn something new about you every day."
Joe,Gotta go make some muffins.
Joe,Donna.
Joe,"I have only one request-- that you wear that, uh, red thing."
Joe,Exactly.
Joe,I have no problem with that.
Joe,Excuse me.
Joe,Without having to reset the fence.
Joe,Muffin?
Joe,"I hope you don't mind, but I noticed that your right rear tire was a little flat, so I patched it, and I inflated it for you."
Joe,You could use it to locate your cuts for the inside shoulder
Joe,It's just a hardwood clamping block connected to a small piece of hackberry.
Joe,You're welcome.
Joe,"Oh, maybe you could use this jig I made."
Joe,Ladies.
Joe,You must feel very lucky to be their stepdad.
Joe,But you're still gonna want to go to a garage 'cause I don'tâ¦
Joe,"Eyes are watching, ears are listening lips are closed, hands are still feet are very quiet you should really try it, listen well, listen well"
Joe,They are great girls.
Joe,Children their age respond positively to melody and rhyme.

Joe From Sewage,I'm up to my waist in hot snizz.
Joe From Sewage,"What's up, Knope?"
Joe From Sewage,That's what we call the Sewage Department.
Joe From Sewage,Yeah.
Joe From Sewage,I wanted a small college experience.
Joe From Sewage,Let's roll.
Joe From Sewage,There's an old sewage department saying.
Joe From Sewage,"""If you've got a nice drainpipe, there's no reason to hide it."""
Joe From Sewage,Looking good these days.
Joe From Sewage,I don't know.
Joe From Sewage,Is this because you're jealous?

Joe From Sewage,"Hello, ladies."
Joe From Sewage,Liking the view.
Joe From Sewage,Sewage.
Joe From Sewage,Nice.
Joe From Sewage,"But at least we don't specialize in losing, like you guys."
Joe From Sewage,Where are you going?
Joe From Sewage,And I don't like that term.
Joe From Sewage,"What would you do if one of your citizens was about to come into some serious physical harm Unless he got 3,000 dollars?"
Joe From Sewage,Let's roll.
Joe From Sewage,"""Crap"" is a slang term."
Joe From Sewage,"Listen, my van's out back."
Joe From Sewage,I told you before.
Joe From Sewage,What do you say?
Joe From Sewage,You said come down.
Joe From Sewage,What's your design going to be?
Joe From Sewage,I made you laugh.
Joe From Sewage,"Hey, Leslie."

Joe From Sewage,"Still got it, Joe."
Joe From Sewage,Let's roll.
Joe From Sewage,Are you her bodyguard?
Joe From Sewage,"You can do anything to me, for any number of seconds."

Joe From Sewage,Is this guy bothering you?
Joe From Sewage,I heard you were giving out free money.
Joe From Sewage,Yeah.
Joe From Sewage,Minimum.
Joe From Sewage,I work for the Sewage Department.
Joe From Sewage,"And as I aforementioned, you have a killer dumpster."
Joe From Sewage,"Whatever, man."
Joe From Sewage,I think she can decide on her own what train she wants to ride.
Joe From Sewage,"I mean, she's an adult."
Joe From Sewage,"I need $3,000."
Joe From Sewage,Van's out back.

John Cena,From the information I got I just assumed you'd be like 10 years old.
John Cena,You're Andy.
John Cena,I'm just doing this as a favor.
John Cena,"I didn't steal his guitar, man."

Julia Wyatt,I'm talking about the wedding.
Julia Wyatt,I cannot be in the same room as him.
Julia Wyatt,"Or, wait, are you even old enough to drink?"
Julia Wyatt,I can take it.
Julia Wyatt,Your father brought his little plaything.
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, by all means, go ahead and take it, Ulani."
Julia Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, Ben!"
Julia Wyatt,"You chose well, Benny."
Julia Wyatt,"He is adorable, isn't he?"

Julia Wyatt,"Frankly, after what he did at Geoffrey's graduation"
Julia Wyatt,Don't worry!
Julia Wyatt,"Aw, what a beautiful apology."
Julia Wyatt,"It had to be done, Ben."
Julia Wyatt,"You can say that again, Steve."

Julia Wyatt,Please call me Julia.
Julia Wyatt,Oh!
Julia Wyatt,There's my boy!
Julia Wyatt,We didn't know it was spring break.
Julia Wyatt,"I'm going to be civil, as long as he is."
June Hartwell,I chose to put my family first.
June Hartwell,Ms. Knope chose to try to have it all.
June Hartwell,"Mike, we all make certain choices."
Justin,See you around.
Justin,"Bye, brother."
Justin,It's a little douchie.
Justin,Try it without the gloves.
Justin,It's horrible.
Justin,We gotta find this guy.
Justin,"Well, at least let me try and find him."
Justin,Imagine how much better that story would be if we actually reunited them?
Justin,Absolutely.
Justin,That doesn't sound gay at all.
Justin,Found him.
Justin,"Lives in a little town called Bridgeport, Illinois."
Justin,"Divorced, no kids, worked as a lifeguard when he was 20."
Justin,"That's-- No, Leslie, that is not a nooner."
Justin,I tracked down this old flame of Leslie's mom.
Justin,We're gonna go pick him up.
Justin,We're gonna reunite them on Valentine's Day.
Justin,Is that a great story or what?
Justin,Pick you up tomorrow around noon.
Justin,That would be amazing.
Justin,"Frank Beckerson, 63."
Justin,Hmm.
Justin,I'm gonna get you a pocket square.
Justin,No.
Justin,Yeah.
Justin,They take a little bit of scorpion poison and they serve--
Justin,More people?
Justin,"All I can say is, this is not what I was expecting."
Justin,I cannot believe there's more.
Justin,No.
Justin,"Well, I had a very pleasant time."
Justin,"And from my perspective, there was no abuse of power with respect to Miss Knope and any of her various guests."
Justin,I had an amazing time.
Justin,She didn't need to.
Justin,"Oh, God."
Justin,"You know, look, I'd been given a case the night before, so I had to stay up all night working on it and I didn't want to cancel."
Justin,Are you kidding me? I was looking forward to it.
Justin,I had an awesome time which had nothing to do with the rec center teachers.
Justin,Great.
Justin,I will see you later.
Justin,Okay.
Justin,Tommy Hav.
Justin,"This might be none of my business, but you need to ask Wendy out."
Justin,"For reals, this time."
Justin,I'm so sorry.
Justin,I saw it.
Justin,Hey.
Justin,These are amazing.
Justin,No.
Justin,It's insane.
Justin,"Oh, God, Leslie."
Justin,I don't even know.
Justin,I think I just lost track of her in all the chaos.
Justin,"Anyway, so, now he and Marlene are off somewhere, doing God knows what."
Justin,I don't wanna--
Justin,"Marlene, what happened between you two? Tell me everything."
Justin,I want every detail.
Justin,"Look, it's sad, I know."
Justin,But we'll still be friends.
Justin,We're gonna see each other all the time.
Justin,"I come into town, like, every other weekend."
Justin,Any friend of Ann's--
Justin,She doesn't wanna see me anymore.
Justin,No.
Justin,"Seriously, this has nothing to do with you."
Justin,Of course.
Justin,Armani's having a sale right now.
Justin,"So, we look over, and he's not even in the car anymore."
Justin,"So Leslie's like, ""That's it, I'm taking him home."""
Justin,Let's just let this unfold.
Justin,She's fine.
Justin,Do you have a bag?
Justin,"Well, give him the purse then."
Justin,Maybe we should--
Justin,Frank.
Justin,Frank.
Justin,Are you kidding me?
Justin,This is so much fun.
Justin,"Look, we took a road trip today."
Justin,We chased your mom's long lost love down a freeway.
Justin,The hottest thing I ever put into my mouth was in this remote village in Southern Brazil.
Justin,So he freaked out a little bit.
Justin,"I mean, you would, too."
Justin,He was fine by the time we got him back inside the car.
Justin,Come on.
Justin,"No, no, no."
Justin,"Look, we're here."
Justin,Let's just see what happens.
Justin,"Now, look."
Justin,You need to breathe.
Justin,"Oh, boy."
Justin,He got nervous.
Justin,You never know.
Justin,"Tom, it's over."
Justin,Unreal!
Justin,"At least this stuff is interesting, you know?"
Justin,"You know, it actually reminds me, two years ago, I was in Borneo officiating a wedding, and this enormous medicine man showed up and he was there to basically tell--"
Justin,"Hey, kiddo!"
Justin,How you doing?
Justin,I know!
Justin,It's so good to see you.
Justin,"Uh, I would love to."
Justin,Leslie?
Justin,I cannot.
Justin,"Please, my pleasure."
Justin,I am swamped.
Justin,"Next week, I promise."
Justin,"Hey, Mark."
Justin,"Oh, my God!"
Justin,It's such a pleasure to meet you.
Justin,Pleasure.
Justin,"Anyway, Leslie, I have to go."
Justin,It has been a super pleasure meeting you.
Justin,"I am gonna get into this over the weekend, and I will get back to you on Monday about it."
Justin,All right.
Justin,Yeah.
Justin,"Okay, Tom."
Justin,I think you're gonna be just fine.
Justin,"Of course I'm gonna have to take a closer look at these things, but my gut's telling me this is not gonna be a big deal."
Justin,Neither.
Justin,"Civil litigation, mostly."
Justin,It can be.
Justin,Not a problem.
Justin,I've got this crazy case-- Have you ever heard of this product Fire in a Can?
Justin,"Well, you shouldn't buy it."
Justin,It'll literally burn your hand clean off.
Justin,Mmmhmm.
Justin,It is an aerosol can with an igniter and a trigger.
Justin,Companies make bogus claims like this all the time.
Justin,It's my pleasure.
Justin,"Ann's friend, Justin."
Justin,Tom.
Justin,Justin.
Justin,"You are very organized, Leslie."
Justin,I love what you do.
Justin,You have the coolest job.
Justin,Let me guess.
Justin,This is our park.
Justin,I want to know everything about this.
Justin,"It's essentially a blowtorch, and if you can believe it, it was invented to warm up baby bottles."
Justin,Good seeing you.
Justin,This a bad time?
Justin,"What's up, brother?"
Justin,I will!
Justin,Hey.
Justin,Sorry I'm a little bit late.
Justin,Andy Dwyer!
Justin,Can't wait to catch up with this guy.
Justin,"Why, yeah."
Justin,Thank you.
Justin,"I can't wait, I'm gonna get to hang out with all your friends tonight."
Justin,All right.
Justin,I'm gonna hold you to that.
Justin,Let's get started!
Justin,How are you?
Justin,Justin.
Justin,Oh--
Justin,"God, India is so amazing."
Justin,Let me tell you something.
Justin,That is my absolute favorite place to travel.
Justin,Where did you say your parents were from?
Justin,"Have you ever been to the Kaniman Mosque, down in Tamil Nadu?"
Justin,"Tell me everything, right now."
Justin,"How you doing, man?"
Justin,All right.
Justin,"You know what, I'm gonna be near Pawnee on Tuesday."
Justin,Oh!
Justin,"Yeah, let's do."
Justin,"See you around, brother."
Justin,Check out paragraph two.
Justin,I drop the F bomb.
Justin,"Definitely have the city attorney look at that, but that should be enough to do the trick."
Justin,It's my pleasure.
Justin,Maybe I'll see you around sometime.
Justin,I'll see you.
Justin,Bye.
Justin,"Oh, my God!"
Justin,You have never been to Carnival?
Justin,"We have to get tickets in February to go to Rio de Janeiro, Leslie Knope."
Justin,Cheers.
Justin,Why?
Justin,All I did was a little paperwork.
Justin,You've got to try this.
Justin,Isn't it great?
Justin,It's camel stomach.
Justin,"I'm teasing, I'm teasing."
Justin,It's chicken.
Justin,"So, when am I gonna see you again?"
Justin,"Oh, my God, that is unbelievable."
Justin,"I feel your pain, brother."
Justin,"I should warn you, land seizure isn't really my specialty, but I'm happy to take a look."
Kate Spivack,"Okay, all right."
Kate Spivack,We should just take a vote.
Kate Spivack,Right? Yeah.
Kate Spivack,What about the vote?
Kate Spivack,My name is Kate Spivack.
Kate Spivack,And I live in the neighborhood.
Kate Spivack,Unbelievable! You know what? We all agree that this park is a bad idea.
Kate Spivack,"Oh, my God! Okay, they have planted people in this audience."
Kate Spivack,"You know what? This is a public forum, which means that we all get to tell you what we think."
Kate Spivack,Excuse me? Can't you read that children's book on your own time?
Kate Spivack,And I am 100% against this park.
Kate Spivack,"I cannot believe the department is moving forward with a project without a single environmental impact study, and if you guys agree with me, let's take a stand."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Yes, they do, sir."
Kathryn Pinewood,We're laying the groundwork for Pawnee's newest restaurant.
Kathryn Pinewood,"It's not my place to speak for the consumer, but everyone should buy it."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Okay, fine."
Kathryn Pinewood,"So if you can make that happen somehow, they'll give you whatever you want."
Kathryn Pinewood,"What is your business, sir?"
Kathryn Pinewood,"This float represents a group of over 300 business owners, individuals, and community leaders who are protesting unfair government regulation."
Kathryn Pinewood,We are the committee to recall Leslie Knope.
Kathryn Pinewood,Let's kick her out of office.
Kathryn Pinewood,"This past year has been a disaster, and this government is hellbent on stripping away our most basic personal freedoms."
Kathryn Pinewood,Sweetums has been desperately trying to get a local celebrity spokesman to endorse their new sports drink.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Kathryn Pinewood,She's gallivanting around Europe like some kind of European.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Apparently, she can't be bothered to stay here in Pawnee, not when there's Europe to gallivant around in."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Sorry, can't help you ladies."
Kathryn Pinewood,But I seem to remember you were recalled.
Kathryn Pinewood,"I mean, if you were still a city councilor, maybe."
Kathryn Pinewood,This town is not better off.
Kathryn Pinewood,Is that right?
Kathryn Pinewood,"All right, shut it down."
Kathryn Pinewood,This is a P.R. nightmare.
Kathryn Pinewood,I don't see why I should do you any favors.
Kathryn Pinewood,I don't have time for disgraced former politicians and unmarried preggos.
Kathryn Pinewood,We can't do anything until the Indian Affairs Commission weighs in.
Kathryn Pinewood,What the hell?
Kathryn Pinewood,But where will it end?
Kathryn Pinewood,"Now, you wanna rob our children of fun by attacking the Sweetums school lunch program, literally taking candy from babies."
Kathryn Pinewood,They're made from plants.
Kathryn Pinewood,Stop restricting our freedoms.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Perd, I take no pleasure in reporting this, but it must come to light."
Kathryn Pinewood,"We are here, trying to make Pawnee better, and where is Leslie Knope?"
Kathryn Pinewood,Is that a threat?
Kathryn Pinewood,"Kathryn Pinewood, Pawnee Restaurant Association."
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Are we putting bargains on trial here?
Kathryn Pinewood,"If you want zero calorie water, try diet water zero lite."
Kathryn Pinewood,More bang for the buck.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Oh, councilwoman, one more thing."
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,"The zero on the label refers to the amount of water in it, which is zero."
Kathryn Pinewood,"If your tax bill passes, local restaurants will hurt badly."
Kathryn Pinewood,We'll have to lay off about 100 people.
Kathryn Pinewood,"That's correct, and it's great for the consumer."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Well, if the customer truly wants a smaller size, there is an option."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Some girls buy them for their dollhouses, but they're not very popular."
Kathryn Pinewood,It has only 60 calories.
Kathryn Pinewood,See you at the meeting.
Kathryn Pinewood,"The second your tax bill passes, this press release goes wide."
Kathryn Pinewood,We'll wait until everything's official.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Ms. Knope, this is about consumer rights, and if they don't want to drink our delicious sodas, we do provide healthier options, like water zero."
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,"Well, it's roughly the size of a two year old child, if the child were liquefied."
Kathryn Pinewood,It's a real bargain at $1.59.
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Take the sign down.
Kathryn Pinewood,"I mean, for only a nickel more, you get 64 ounces."
Kay Hanley,Sure.
Kay Hanley,"Just living on a Sunday morning got my toast and tea, and I'm warm and I just thought I'd think about and it might be the comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky could never parallel the challenge of an acqusition in the here and now, here and now"
Kay Hanley,Thanks for having me.
Keef,I see more ground than playground!
Keef,High five!
Keef,I got a remote control and I'm controlling you.
Keef,"Come on, people!"
Keef,Kaboom.
Keef,"Hey, look."
Keef,Nope.
Keef,Go faster.
Keef,But you teach a man how to kaboom.
Keef,"Kaboom, kaboom, kaboom."
Keef,"Remember, you take a man kabooming, he kabooms for a day."
Keef,"At least you guys will be kabooming somewhere, right?"
Keef,"So, you guys gonna join us tomorrow in Muncie?"
Keef,And one more for you.
Keef,"There you go, for you."
Keef,"You can look at a problem, and you can either go, ""Oh, this is a problem"" or you can kaboom, blow it up and turn it into something great."
Keef,Not if you have the Kaboom spirit.
Keef,I got gifts.
Keef,Great job.
Keef,Look at you two and your big kabooms.
Keef,Whoa.
Keef,"Go faster, Ron's the master."
Keef,"One day, 24 hours."
Keef,Go faster.
Keef,They'll never see it coming.
Keef,You literally kaboom the problem.
Keef,High five!
Keef,High five!
Keef,Kaboom is a word I made up.
Keef,It's not in any dictionary.
Keef,Awesome!
Keef,All right!
Keef,I trick people into building playgrounds on empty lots in their neighborhoods.
Keef,It's an elaborate prank.
Keef,Are you guys my friends?
Keef,"For my next prank, I'm going to build a hospital in a poor part of China."
Keef,It is playground time!
Keef,"My name is Keef, and I am your friend."
Kelly Larson,I didn't want to drag her into it.
Kelly Larson,"Make me, Bob!"
Kelly Larson,"Hope you don't mind, I moved myself over to this pipe."
Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Leslie."
Kelly Larson,Here.
Kelly Larson,Can I tell you why?
Kelly Larson,Awesome.
Kelly Larson,Read Twilight.
Kelly Larson,You know what you should do?
Kelly Larson,Thanks.
Kelly Larson,"Author Stephenie Meyer, nee Morgan, was born in Hartford, Connecticut."
Kelly Larson,"You seem tense, Leslie."
Kelly Larson,"Hey, Leslie, thanks for setting this up."
Kelly Larson,"And combined, they have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide."
Kelly Larson,"Now, have you seen any of the Twilight movies?"
Kelly Larson,"Read Twilight, and it transformed your life and you're gonna put it in the time capsule?"
Kelly Larson,Movie number one.
Kelly Larson,Twilight.
Kelly Larson,"Okay, Christmas Eve, 1973."
Kelly Larson,"So, I read about your time capsule and I thought that if I could somehow convince you to get it in there, I'd be a big hero."
Kelly Larson,"Well, you seem pretty chipper this morning."
Kelly Larson,I'm older and a boy.
Kelly Larson,I'm sorry.
Kelly Larson,This is a mistake.
Kelly Larson,You don't have to put Twilight in the time capsule.
Kelly Larson,She loves Twilight.
Kelly Larson,"Liz's mom and I divorced a couple years ago, and it's been really hard on her."
Kelly Larson,"It was all right, considering."
Kelly Larson,Thank you so much.
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,But I feel very strongly that these should be included.
Kelly Larson,What?
Kelly Larson,"Hey, you go back to Russia! You go back to wherever you came from!"
Kelly Larson,I'm Kelly Larson.
Kelly Larson,"Yes, Twilight!"
Kelly Larson,"I read online about your time capsule, and I'm here to make a suggestion."
Kelly Larson,We slowly pan up over a mossy log to see a deer drinking crystal clear water.
Kelly Larson,"Honestly, Twilight could go in almost any of these categories."
Kelly Larson,"It's a beautifully told saga of vampires, werewolves and romance."
Kelly Larson,"Well, I'm not."
Kelly Larson,You promised!
Kelly Larson,It's a little more comfortable.
Kelly Larson,"Well, let me describe them to you shot for shot."
Kelly Larson,"The town of Forks, Washington is exactly like Pawnee, except for the climate and the vampires."
Kelly Larson,Sorry.
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,"I disagree, okay?"
Kelly Larson,"Edward's primary goal, at all times, is Bella's protection."
Kelly Larson,And a third and a fourth.
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,Please!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,Get him away from me!
Kelly Larson,I am very scared of you!
Kelly Larson,"Hey, Leslie, I'm making some Sleepytime tea."
Kelly Larson,Get cracking.
Kelly Larson,Twilight: New Moon.
Kelly Larson,Do you want any?
Kelly Larson,Book two.
Kelly Larson,Here.
Kelly Larson,"Sing it, friend."
Kelly Larson,I told you.
Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Tom."
Kelly Larson,Let's keep it down.
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,Sorry.
Kelly Larson,But I do know something about heartbreak.
Kelly Larson,I beg you to reconsider.
Kelly Larson,Then I'm gonna have to do this.
Kelly Larson,You look sad.
Kelly Larson,"It's a girl, isn't it?"
Kelly Larson,"Hey, I was the guy who introduced you to--"
Kelly Larson,I can tell.
Kelly Larson,It's the look that Mike had on his face when Bella turned him down for the dance.
Kelly Larson,"Okay, I'll be quiet."
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,And you know who else does?
Kelly Larson,No.
Kelly Larson,A little lady named Twilight author Stephenie Meyer.
Kelly Larson,Why?
Kelly Larson,Bella's love for Edward is being tested.
Kelly Larson,Be considerate.
Kelly Larson,This muscleheaded Stormtrooper doesn't scare me.
Kelly Larson,They're hidden somewhere very far away.
Kelly Larson,"Look, I really don't want to cause any trouble, but I am not gonna leave until you put Twilight in the time capsule."
Kelly Larson,I'm not doing anything wrong.
Kelly Larson,"Look at it this way, Tom."
Kelly Larson,"Well, the fact remains this is perfectly legal."
Ken Hotate,There are two things I know about white people.
Ken Hotate,I would like to go on record.
Ken Hotate,It is offensive.
Ken Hotate,Take it off.
Ken Hotate,Water?
Ken Hotate,"Why, yes, I thought that was obvious."
Ken Hotate,You and Leslie had a deal.
Ken Hotate,"It reminds me of what the settlers of Pawnee did to my ancestors, taking their land without permission."
Ken Hotate,Perhaps it's time that we revisited those contracts.
Ken Hotate,Please.
Ken Hotate,"Hold on, Ms. Knope."
Ken Hotate,"Speaking as a citizen of Pawnee, I do not like the way you went back on your deal with Councilwoman Knope."
Ken Hotate,"They love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses."
Ken Hotate,"If that deal is not restored, well, I believe there are six Paunch Burgers in the Wamapoke casino."
Ken Hotate,"I completely understand you, but this is sacred burial ground."
Ken Hotate,Like fire water?
Ken Hotate,"The Wamapoke people have a saying, ""Only one who listens hears the cry of the wolf."""
Ken Hotate,Is this the guy?
Ken Hotate,And we don't even get to keep the land?
Ken Hotate,So you would like the Wamapoke people to pay the federal government millions of dollars to buy land that was stolen from us by the federal government?
Ken Hotate,"You know, we have been considering opening a second resort."
Ken Hotate,How short?
Ken Hotate,He is a huge disappointment.
Ken Hotate,My son sells them on Etsy.
Ken Hotate,"Why, yes, it is."
Ken Hotate,Thank you for having me.
Ken Hotate,And I just hope that the souls of my ancestors don't put a curse on this festival.
Ken Hotate,"The fact is, this carnival is being held on top of an ancient Wamapoke burial site."
Ken Hotate,Exactly.
Ken Hotate,I spoke to Leslie Knope of the Parks Department about moving the carnival and she refused.
Ken Hotate,"Now, that's interesting."
Ken Hotate,That is exactly what happened.
Ken Hotate,"So, you need to borrow our generator?"
Ken Hotate,"Hi, Leslie."
Ken Hotate,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but this is a big one."
Ken Hotate,I'm under a lot of pressure.
Ken Hotate,I'm going to need to formally ask you to move the carnival.
Ken Hotate,"During the battle, 93 year old chief was shot one hundred and two times by the cavalry."
Ken Hotate,And this moment will be commemorated for the next seven days with shooting galleries and fried dough stands.
Ken Hotate,"After careful examination, we have determined that these Wamapoke artifacts could not have originated in lot 48."
Ken Hotate,That advice has been passed down from generation to generation.
Ken Hotate,You first.
Ken Hotate,"Today, I give that advice to you."
Ken Hotate,"That's racist, and I do not appreciate it."
Ken Hotate,I'm just messing with you.
Ken Hotate,But seriously.
Ken Hotate,I'll have a whiskey.
Ken Hotate,What about and I'm just spitballing here a large neon advertisement for the Wamapoke casino?
Ken Hotate,"We have a new slogan that I'm quite proud of: ""Our slots are downright filthy."""
Ken Hotate,"In that case, the playground will be great."
Ken Hotate,Why don't we retire to my longhouse and smoke the ceremonial peace pipe to celebrate?
Ken Hotate,And I will issue a statement saying that the curse has been lifted.
Ken Hotate,"You can have the generator, Leslie."
Ken Hotate,A Native American tribe making a deal with the government. What could go wrong?
Ken Hotate,"With that sacred ceremony, the Wamapoke curse has been lifted."
Ken Hotate,That is not great.
Ken Hotate,Why are you telling me all this?
Ken Hotate,"Wamapoke Casino, slowly taking our money back from white people, one quarter at a time."
Ken Hotate,"Twice a day, one lucky visitor will hit the mega wolf jackpot, and Coinsy will howl for you."
Ken Hotate,Listen for Coinsy the Wolf at Wamapoke Casino.
Ken Hotate,"Does it, white man?"
Kid,"Hey, I'm going to eat in my room because I have to study."
Kid,"Bye, Dad."
Kid,"Bye, Mom."
Kid,"Bye, Mom."
Kid,Have you finished your homework?
Kid,"Bye, Dad."
Kid,Can we go to Bobby's house to watch the game?
Kids,Linguine.
Kids,Egg noodles.
Kids,Spaghetti.
Kids,Macaroni.
Kids,Fusilli.
Kids,Tetrazzini.
Kim Terlando,For housebreaking puppies.
Kim Terlando,Nice to see you.
Kim Terlando,I'm glad you're so confident.
Kim Terlando,"And I know you all think it's just a useless tabloid, but it's not."
Kim Terlando,I'd expect nothing less.
Kim Terlando,"Did you make that can of ""whoop ass"" for this exact moment?"
Kim Terlando,Good luck with your speech.
Kim Terlando,And also the people that work with me over at the Pawnee Sun.
Kim Terlando,Unlike you losers.
Kim Terlando,"Well I have never seen Star Wars, because I was too busy hooking up with guys."
Kim Terlando,"How serious is that, exactly?"
Kim Terlando,I've also learned that the EPA found midi-chlorians in the soil.
Kim Terlando,"Uh, Councilwoman Knope, you've claimed construction will take 18 months, but a source tells me it will be much longer."
Kim Terlando,Some people say that the Sun has a problem with the truth.
Kim Terlando,"There's no problem, we just ignore it."
Kim Terlando,That is a baseless accusation.
Kim Terlando,It is great.
Kim Terlando,"Now I love working at the Sun, okay?"
Kim Terlando,"Thank you, Martin."
Kim Terlando,It's nice to be here among all of these excellent journalists.
Kipp Bunthart,The woman is only talking to other women.
Kipp Bunthart,What a surprise.
Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!

Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!

Kipp Bunthart,Let Ben speak! Let Ben speak!
Kipp Bunthart,Oh.
Kipp Bunthart,So I guess he was asking for it because of the way he was dressed?
Kipp Bunthart,Can we have one conversation about feminism where men get to be in charge?
Kipp Bunthart,I don't need your pity.
Kipp Bunthart,From the tyranny of women.
Kipp Bunthart,We are the Male Men.
Kipp Bunthart,"We are a men's rights activist group, and we are fed up."
Kipp Bunthart,We are sick and tired of this feminized society.
Kipp Bunthart,First Leslie Knope poaches her husband's campaign by making it all about her.
Kipp Bunthart,Behind every successful woman is a man she has oppressed.
Kipp Bunthart,I had a broken bike chain.
Kipp Bunthart,Now she's forcing him to bake pies and enter a contest for her?
Kipp Bunthart,I just got here.
Kipp Bunthart,Sorry.
Kipp Bunthart,Oh.
Kipp Bunthart,My bad.
Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!
Kirsten Gillibrand,"""To Leslie, my inspiration, my muse, my partner in crime."""
Kirsten Gillibrand,Of course.
Kirsten Gillibrand,"""I owe it all to you."""
Kirsten Gillibrand,"Well, I think I've said all I want to say right here."
Kirsten Gillibrand,Of course.
Kirsten Gillibrand,Okay.
Kirsten Gillibrand,I have to say I'm really impressed with what you guys are doing over at Interior.
Kyle,"Andy, come on!"
Kyle,Why wouldn't you have his same last name?
Kyle,I love the umami flavor.
Kyle,What?
Kyle,"Afternoon, Andy."
Kyle,Oh.
Kyle,Can I get my shoes shined?
Kyle,"The doctor says it's probably not serious, but it might be."
Kyle,What the what just happened?

Kyle,You shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
Kyle,It's not good business.
Kyle,They were frozen.
Kyle,Right.
Kyle,I'm saying you shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
Kyle,Ron's is better.
Kyle,"I was eating rice, and Ron made me come up here."
Kyle,"But sure, that sounds fun."
Kyle,That doesn't add up.
Kyle,"You're not my boss, I work for the city attorney's office."
Kyle,What?
Kyle,"Donna, you wanted to see me?"
Kyle,Kyle.
Kyle,"Sorry, Andy."
Kyle,I'm a little busy right now.
Landlord,"I'm sorry, man."

Landlord,"Look, we'll get it fixed and I'll see you Monday."
Larry Ludgate,I'll come with you.
Larry Ludgate,It's Zuzu's boss.
Larry Ludgate,"Well, hello there."
Larry Ludgate,"You make yourself at home, Mr. Swanson."
Larry Ludgate,You must be Ron Swanson.
Larry Ludgate,Call me Larry.
Larry Ludgate,"Well, welcome to Casa Ludgate!"

Laura,"See you in a couple weeks, April."
Laura,The Bline is a cool outdoor trail that cuts right through downtown.
Laura,I'm Laura.
Laura,"Totally, happy to."
Lauren,"I liked talking with you, too, Mr. Swanson."
Lauren,What was that?
Lauren,"I made a ""Gertrude Stein."""
Lauren,I disagree.
Lauren,But that's not fair.
Lauren,But my report's due tomorrow.
Lauren,The drinking age is 21.
Lauren,Yeah.
Lauren,Why government matters.
Lauren,What about a public forum?
Lauren,You always say that there's no better solution for a hotbutton issue than a good old fashioned public forum.
Lauren,You have mustard in your mustache.
Lauren,"Thanks, Ron."
Lauren,Hello?
Lauren,Hello?
Lauren,The ad says today.
Lauren,Hi.
Lauren,Lauren Burkiss.
Lauren,"My class is here on a field trip, and I'm supposed to interview someone for a school project."
Lauren,But aren't you here now?
Lauren,We're here for the club.
Lauren,Sure.
Lauren's Mom,"Oh, that's nice."
Lauren's Mom,And you ate her lunch?
Lauren's Mom,They're supposed to do cute reports and get gold stars.
Lauren's Mom,And you gave her a land mine? Really?
Lauren's Mom,Are you Ron Swanson?
Lauren's Mom,"Okay, what exactly did you teach my daughter?"
Lauren's Mom,"Well, she is a fourth grader."
Lauren's Mom,This is what she wrote.
Lauren's Mom,Is this a joke?
Lauren's Mom,I How?
Lauren's Mom,Lauren was supposed to do a paper on why government matters.
Lauren's Mom,And fourth graders aren't supposed to have their heads crammed full of weird ideas.
Lawrence,"It's loud, it's abusive, and it's waking up my birds."
Lawrence,It's my boom box now.
Lawrence,Hey! I recognize her.
Lawrence,That kid came to my door yesterday.
Lawrence,"Hey, park lady."
Lawrence,I have more of a comment than a question.
Lawrence,It's for the guy in the casts.
Lawrence,How do you like it?
Lawrence,You suck.
Lawrence,How do you like that?
Lawrence,"Uh, yeah."
Lawrence,I asked you nicely.
Lawrence,Now imagine you're holding coffee.
Lawrence,I don't care about any of that.
Lawrence,Hey!
Lawrence,He's the guy that plays music all night in his garage.
Lawrence,"Okay, you know what? I'm taking this."
Lawrence,Turn it down.
Lawrence,Hey.
Lawrence,It's driving me nuts.
Lawrence,I don't care.
Lawrence,Turn that down.
Lawrence,"I have nice, pretty, expensive birds, and you play that music, and it wakes them up."
Lawrence,"Yeah, I have birds."
Lawrence,These pretzels suck!
LeVondrious,Now no one gets any popcorn.
LeVondrious,I brought it back.
LeVondrious,Don't worry.
LeVondrious,Despite what you did to me all those years ago.
LeVondrious,"Oh, you must be referring to the microwave incident."
LeVondrious,"What's up, girl? Didn't expect to see your baby bro at your wedding, huh? Well, I'm here."
Leonard Tchulm,"Ms. Knope, I'm afraid I have to once again give Pawnee a failing grade."
Leonard Tchulm,My name is Leonard Tchulm.
Leonard Tchulm,I'm head of the Indiana Department of Emergency Preparedness.
Leonard Tchulm,Specifically asked that the drill to be done today and said I should give you everything I got.
Leonard Tchulm,Councilman Jamm requested it.
Leonard Tchulm,"Oh, no, hardly ever."
Leonard Tchulm,Nine.
Leonard Tchulm,Uh Probably six to eight more hours.
Leonard Tchulm,All phones.
Leonard Tchulm,All phones.
Leonard Tchulm,Please deposit your phones into this box.
Leonard Tchulm,Panic from the outbreak has overloaded cell phone towers.
Leonard Tchulm,Attention.
Leonard Tchulm,And today I'm going to bring death and destruction to your town.
Leonard Tchulm,"Good, because the best day for a drill is when it's inconvenient for everyone."
Leonard Tchulm,My mother is getting a colonoscopy today.
Leonard Tchulm,Prepare for the diarrhea.
Leonard Tchulm,"Mm, we're not that close."
Leonard Tchulm,"Okay, volunteer victims, please put your identification placards on now and go to your designated areas throughout town."
Leonard Tchulm,Doesn't matter.
Leonard Tchulm,"So you rode a bus with a contagious man, and he infected you and 39 others."
Leonard Tchulm,"Unfortunately, no one contacted the transit department to shut down bus service."
Leonard Tchulm,"No, you did not."
Leonard Tchulm,"First Responders, return to your stations, and the simulation begins Went past the zero."
Leonard Tchulm,"I got to wait till it goes Okay, now."
Leonard Tchulm,I regret to inform you that someone in this room has begun exhibiting symptoms Christopher Traeger.
Leonard Tchulm,Not so fast.
Leonard Tchulm,"And now, I'm going to open one of these ten envelopes at random to determine your simulated disaster."
Leonard Tchulm,Pawnee has been hit by A strain of avian flu.
Leonard Tchulm,"I'm not even sure there's anyone there to drive her home, so we're all making sacrifices, Ms. Knope."
Leonard Tchulm,This was bad Fort Wayne bad.
Leonard Tchulm,All phones.
Leonard Tchulm,I believe you.
Leonard Tchulm,I'm impotent.
Leonard Tchulm,Maybe I'll find my way back here in a month for a redo.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,It felt so good.
Leslie Knope,I just can't let Jerry leave here with nothing and go home to an empty life.
Leslie Knope,Mac and cheese pizza?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a member, and I think we could really use you."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's an app for calculating tips."
Leslie Knope,You're making that?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you are the sweetest man in the world."
Leslie Knope,I love loose cannoning.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love the power of no consequences."
Leslie Knope,I was wondering would you like to join the Pawnee Historical Commission?
Leslie Knope,Where is it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, goody, you're all here."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know I'm not supposed to talk about my campaign in the office, but last night I've made a decision about who should be my campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,This is a huge job.
Leslie Knope,"Believe it or not, Jerry, you were young once."
Leslie Knope,Young and full of dreams.
Leslie Knope,"In times of stress, or moments of transition, sometimes it can feel like the whole world is closing in on you."
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, I got my ass handed to me."
Leslie Knope,Because you were embezzling I hope.
Leslie Knope,You're not married.
Leslie Knope,She's not married.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,but you're right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"That sounds pretty sexy, right?"
Leslie Knope,But what if we took a day on and stayed here and worked on some projects?
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh, I guess."
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait for our day off.
Leslie Knope,Probably would've got more stuff done if I hadn't spent so much time brainstorming scrapbook titles.
Leslie Knope,It's actually one of the subtitles of my scrapbook.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, it's so much work."
Leslie Knope,I can't ask you to put your lives on hold.
Leslie Knope,I have a Friend Week present for you right now.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to say Except Let's go win an election! Giving Christmas gifts is like a sport to me.
Leslie Knope,"And, uh, why don't you tell Shauna to make herself decent and I'll apologize to her as well."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, well."
Leslie Knope,"But the only problem is there's tons of meetings, lots of work with people who also love history, and many social occasions that you're gonna have to attend, like cocktail parties and such."
Leslie Knope,"So, cookies."
Leslie Knope,That's all you need.
Leslie Knope,I'm very sneaky.
Leslie Knope,I wish you could've seen it.
Leslie Knope,"He wanted to meet the mayor, have a building named after him."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, how are you? How's your family?"
Leslie Knope,See what I did?
Leslie Knope,"Well, that does sound fascinating,"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann, yes."
Leslie Knope,You should do that.
Leslie Knope,I can understand if it's something you don't want to commit to.
Leslie Knope,You've very opposed by me.
Leslie Knope,"When that happens, you should close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen to the people who love you when they give you advice, and remember what really matters."
Leslie Knope,You're cute.
Leslie Knope,You're smart as a whip and you're cool under pressure.
Leslie Knope,"City Councilor Leslie Knope, clearance level four."
Leslie Knope,You've resuscitated a human heart in your bare hands.
Leslie Knope,"Garth, I have another proposition."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but shouldn't we?"
Leslie Knope,"This year, though? My friends won."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it sounds so cool."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we just need to get in there real quick and maybe take a picture."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? No, that's not it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I'm pregnant."
Leslie Knope,"He's retiring as a city hall employee after 41 years, and it was his dream to eat here."
Leslie Knope,Even the saggy ones.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Julie, could you stay, please?"
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, I cannot catch a break."
Leslie Knope,Run!
Leslie Knope,We can still spend time together as friends.
Leslie Knope,Next on the docket is a vote to approve the Pawnee Eagleton reservoir merger.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,I promised you an executive meal and you're gonna get one.
Leslie Knope,Because every memory deserves to be chronicled.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, just okay."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go in there and take a picture with Jerry.
Leslie Knope,I put my arm around nothing.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful tropical fish."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, don't open that."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, they're with me."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"And as unrealistic and absurd as those goals were, we are not letting you retire until we help you achieve them."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,But time is the relentless and cruel enemy of the devoted civil servant.
Leslie Knope,Finding or making that perfect something.
Leslie Knope,"This is going to require a lot of late night, oneonone jam sessions with me, and we're going to bounce ideas off of each other, you're going to have to take calls for me, any time, day or night."
Leslie Knope,"And if you have the ability to go to Paris, by all means, go to Paris."
Leslie Knope,"The person I have chosen is, drum roll please, Ann Perkins!"
Leslie Knope,He's not wearing any pants.
Leslie Knope,There was so much more I wanted to do.
Leslie Knope,It's also like a sport to me because I always win.
Leslie Knope,"I Oh, well, math is worthless in real life."
Leslie Knope,So let's see what's first.
Leslie Knope,"""Eat in city council private dining room."""
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,That we can achieve.
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Herb."
Leslie Knope,This year whizzed by so fast.
Leslie Knope,Give it up for Ann!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I am putting together a scrapbook commemorating my first year on the city council.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,And you're right.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Why not?
Leslie Knope,Ralph Nader.
Leslie Knope,Tofu.
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I love it! Aw, I love it, and I love you guys, and Ann specifically."
Leslie Knope,Did you bring those with you just to do that?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! You guys, this is the best Breakfast Day/Waffle Day joint present I have ever received."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,There's absolutely no way we are doing this.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, bean sprouts."
Leslie Knope,"No, Andy!"
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah! He's naked, everybody! Put that away!"
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,"This year, the honor goes to Mr. Garth Blundin!"
Leslie Knope,This water is filled with sugar.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"From this year hence, a volunteer will represent Ted in our town's most historic and cherished tradition."
Leslie Knope,Though Garth and I did come up with a compromise that I think will make everybody happy.
Leslie Knope,"I just couldn't vote against a good, old-fashioned lake dunking."
Leslie Knope,"Well, look, you just got to make the most of the job that you have."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I understand where he's coming from."
Leslie Knope,Try flame duck 'cause this duck is on fire.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,This won't take long.
Leslie Knope,Lame duck?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,He's smiling at us!
Leslie Knope,What's going on here?
Leslie Knope,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,What about Ann Month and Ben Month?
Leslie Knope,Point taken.
Leslie Knope,"That's ridiculous, I'm so much better."
Leslie Knope,"And then you Photoshop him in later, okay?"
Leslie Knope,What the [Bleep] is happening right now?
Leslie Knope,I'm no better at them than you are.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Down with Sweetums!
Leslie Knope,"Like, take that trash collector."
Leslie Knope,Down with that poison peddling corporate monster.
Leslie Knope,It's unacceptable.
Leslie Knope,"Ever since Sweetums opened its doors, obesity is up 100%."
Leslie Knope,"My point is, Sweetums is an evil, profit hungry corporation that is ruining our health."
Leslie Knope,You're both dying.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell us?
Leslie Knope,That would be amazing.
Leslie Knope,Bad example.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What's next cookie dough toothpaste?
Leslie Knope,"Simply put, it would be madness to let Sweetums take over our water supply and pump it full of sugar."
Leslie Knope,Let's relax.
Leslie Knope,Leslie's fine.
Leslie Knope,Just wait.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April."
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,I like it.
Leslie Knope,I'm game.
Leslie Knope,Weird.
Leslie Knope,"This is everything in his file a handicapped parking sticker from when he got gout, a Parks and Rec golf cart driving exam which he failed, a scathing performance review."
Leslie Knope,Yeah? What are you gonna do instead?
Leslie Knope,Jen Barkley telling me I had a future was the best present I could've gotten.
Leslie Knope,"Garth dropped his protest, and we were able to get rid of all the outdated laws in the town charter."
Leslie Knope,I'm really proud of you.
Leslie Knope,I think that's great.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"No, you're not running unopposed."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the team.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, why would anyone be so mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait."
Leslie Knope,I wrote this.
Leslie Knope,I stand by it.
Leslie Knope,Stay in school.
Leslie Knope,"That's what I thought, but when he started, he had a lot of dreams and goals."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at his original entry paperwork."
Leslie Knope,"Math is very important, especially for young women."
Leslie Knope,What brings you back to Pawnee?
Leslie Knope,"I'll be gone for the next 19 1/2 hours, so can you water my plants in my office?"
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,I don't understand.
Leslie Knope,"Here I am thinking about how fast my first year in city council has gone, and Jerry has had 40 years whiz past him with nothing to show for it."
Leslie Knope,"It's cute, and it's fun, and it needs to be saved."
Leslie Knope,But there will be a third week.
Leslie Knope,Everybody wait.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It will be called Friend Week.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with him?
Leslie Knope,"As much as we want this to happen, we can't let Jerry just disappear."
Leslie Knope,But I'm just gonna spend the remainder of my term cramming in as many good projects as I can.
Leslie Knope,Because minigolf is awesome.
Leslie Knope,"It will be commemorating this week, the week that my two best friends became each other's best friends."
Leslie Knope,We will eat waffles and then we will go home and make out on our couch.
Leslie Knope,Are you really gonna do that?
Leslie Knope,"That is my future, for now."
Leslie Knope,We have to commemorate this somehow.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you stay?
Leslie Knope,"Well, they're having a party in here."
Leslie Knope,"I did not change Article Two, though."
Leslie Knope,Seems to me we ought to use it.
Leslie Knope,There's pictures in there.
Leslie Knope,"It's been an honor to serve this town, and I will cherish the memories forever."
Leslie Knope,"It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but he's doing it with a smile on his face."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,And all of you! You did all of this together?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the charter is a wonderful document, but we've had the benefit of almost 200 years of learning and advancing."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then."
Leslie Knope,How am I the one that is getting booted off of this city council?
Leslie Knope,It's a pretty sexy topic already.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's like a little stopwatch that records your jogging times and then sends it to your computer via Bluetooth.
Leslie Knope,I-- You have a wonderful life.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for sharing this with me.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I got your Christmas present."
Leslie Knope,I'm as loose as a goose.
Leslie Knope,Keep things light.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know, councilman."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, there's probably a less gross way to say it, but sure."
Leslie Knope,That was a little dry.
Leslie Knope,"What do you say we have some fun, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Do your thing, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Prepare for battle.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay this should probably only take five more minutes."
Leslie Knope,I need you to stay upbeat.
Leslie Knope,We need to fight fire with fire.
Leslie Knope,"I call a town hall meeting, I gather everyone together, I distribute the binders, but now the binders are bright yellow!"
Leslie Knope,Boom!
Leslie Knope,Too extreme?
Leslie Knope,"As a government employee, that's true, but I am just here as a concerned citizen and founder of PCP."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Committee of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,We have many demands.
Leslie Knope,"Specifically, these six unfunded projects that need to be dealt with immediately."
Leslie Knope,What are you saying we need to sex up fluoride?
Leslie Knope,Not good enough!
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need to have Jamm fall in love with this place, so I'm rolling out the red carpet."
Leslie Knope,Why did it take me so long to realize this?
Leslie Knope,Where am I?
Leslie Knope,I'm a loose cannon.
Leslie Knope,Check this.
Leslie Knope,Aww.
Leslie Knope,"Yikes, okay."
Leslie Knope,Is that what you did?
Leslie Knope,How about a snow cone on me?
Leslie Knope,And what a bargain.
Leslie Knope,It's just important.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,We went back to 26%?
Leslie Knope,Because it's my dream job.
Leslie Knope,I am a lifelong government bureaucrat who's wellversed in the issues.
Leslie Knope,"And his family employs half the town, but so what?"
Leslie Knope,He is attractive and charming.
Leslie Knope,Stop right there.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"He just entered the race, and he's already 70 points up in all the polls."
Leslie Knope,And those are the kind of sexy qualifications that win elections.
Leslie Knope,So I made you this scrapbook with nearly 4 amazing pages jam-packed with memories of your time in the government.
Leslie Knope,Boo!
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,My pleasure.
Leslie Knope,See you in hell!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is just a little militant citizen group I slapped together."
Leslie Knope,"But enough about me, what are my polling results?"
Leslie Knope,"What are they gonna do, kick me out of office?"
Leslie Knope,"You know, it doesn't make any sense."
Leslie Knope,Why not?
Leslie Knope,And we're at 15%?
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, nice putter."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride's boring, guys."
Leslie Knope,What a great and funny story.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if Jamm says that, then he is a lying idiot, and if you believe it, then so are you."
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride protects your teeth, and it's perfectly healthy for you."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, before we start, anybody want a hot dog?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,I expected more from you.
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I am rage glowing."
Leslie Knope,What the hell is this?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,I think you solved it.
Leslie Knope,There are no consequences to my actions anymore.
Leslie Knope,"Jeremy, you're the swing vote."
Leslie Knope,"No matter what I do, literally nothing bad can happen to me."
Leslie Knope,Let it go.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a mystery, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should take a real day off and talk about starting our family.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we're always gonna work, but I think we need to fill this scrapbook too."
Leslie Knope,"No, no she's not."
Leslie Knope,"I'm like a white, male U.S. senator."
Leslie Knope,Milton is with Dexhart.
Leslie Knope,"Second, you wanna cut funding for the Pawnee Palms Public PuttPutt?"
Leslie Knope,What did the P.P.P.P.P. ever do to you?
Leslie Knope,At least you have a good reason.
Leslie Knope,I'm wondering which way you two are leaning.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, tomorrow we are voting on funding for the minigolf course, and personally, I think it is great for families, it's a great job creator, and it's extremely cute."
Leslie Knope,"Councilmen, I have something to discuss with you, but before I do, can I just point out how handsome the both of you look today?"
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,It already has windmills.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,And it'll produce double the amount of electricity.
Leslie Knope,"That puttputt is gonna be around forever, and when I am done with it, it'll attract more visitors than the Hoover Dam."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I will argue, and I'm gonna win."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go solder a chair instead?
Leslie Knope,You also believe in making furniture.
Leslie Knope,"Pretty gardens, hummingbird feeders."
Leslie Knope,"Schools, police, minigolf, merrygorounds, parades, gazebo repair, roads and bridges, whatever."
Leslie Knope,"Ron is very antigovernment, and he has that philosophy, but there are just certain things that you don't cut."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I represent the PCP."
Leslie Knope,We have a list of six demands.
Leslie Knope,Here they are in alphabetical order.
Leslie Knope,Number one: Ants.
Leslie Knope,But there are only 12 of us.
Leslie Knope,I love my job.
Leslie Knope,Look!
Leslie Knope,Our numbers are growing!
Leslie Knope,"There's nothing we can't do if we work hard, never sleep, and shirk all other responsibilities in our lives."
Leslie Knope,You with me?
Leslie Knope,This is all my fault.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I spent your day off with Jerry instead of relaxing with you.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, mom."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Concerned citizen and community leader Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,Because all it does is prevent cavities!
Leslie Knope,"We are also going to protest along his jogging route, and I need someone in every GNC within a fivemile radius of the city center."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to Tdazzle.
Leslie Knope,I want one of you calling it every 15 minutes.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Too many ants in the teen center.
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride is going into the water, moron."
Leslie Knope,Number two: Tennis court improvements.
Leslie Knope,Number three
Leslie Knope,I want what Jerry has.
Leslie Knope,"Speaking of which, the fact that yahtzee is not in the rec center is a tragedy on par with human trafficking."
Leslie Knope,Slight exaggeration Getting back to our demands.
Leslie Knope,We will not be muzzled like a rabid dog.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take this all the way to the top.
Leslie Knope,"Achievements are great, but I want more than that."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have made some waves here, people, but we need to keep this momentum going."
Leslie Knope,"Now, the city manager's name is Chris Traeger."
Leslie Knope,I want to take this fight to him.
Leslie Knope,"But in the blink of an eye, I'm gonna be retiring, you know, and flying off on Marine One with you and a Secret Service detail."
Leslie Knope,"God, Diane, will you stop it with the letterwriting campaign?"
Leslie Knope,I have his office number.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, on to the next Jerry goal meet Mayor Knudson."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,It's not a chemical.
Leslie Knope,"I will be heading to lunch today, with my husband, at JJ's Diner."
Leslie Knope,Fluoride in the water it's a no-brainer.
Leslie Knope,"So henceforth, Parks and Rec conference room will serve as a testament to your years of public service."
Leslie Knope,But I thought maybe he could have a room named after him.
Leslie Knope,"Again, that is an absurd request considering your work record."
Leslie Knope,"When Jerry first applied for this job, one of this goals was to have a building named after him."
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is better than meatloaf."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you are on fire, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,The nation of Denmark would like to formerly request a summit with the nation of Peru over there by the refreshment table.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone gather around."
Leslie Knope,Because the nation of Denmark needs a juice box.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, let's go."
Leslie Knope,Having fun?
Leslie Knope,You got 'em.
Leslie Knope,We can just pretend it means retire in peace.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"Don't touch my pickles, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,You have made us porn peddlers!
Leslie Knope,I won.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,But Dexhart now has another sex scandal.
Leslie Knope,Everyone stop applauding.
Leslie Knope,So they recall me after all I've done for them!
Leslie Knope,So bring out the cake!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,I don't know if I'm going to.
Leslie Knope,"For the record, I was just trying to help a place that had tremendous cultural value."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I haven't."
Leslie Knope,Please don't do that.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, I return to my old job in a week, and that's great because I love my old job, but My heart was really set on this new job."
Leslie Knope,That's why I took you to Mick Jagger's abandoned gas station.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Howser is with me."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee government now effectively owns a porn shop.
Leslie Knope,Is that what you want?
Leslie Knope,I think this proves that this is a wonderful place that brings joy to people's lives and brings a community together.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,You were very fair.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, I'm the one that needs to apologize."
Leslie Knope,But actually his real cause of death was being thrown out of a helicopter while handcuffed.
Leslie Knope,I got you involved in PCP.
Leslie Knope,"But I'm starting a new group now, LSD, Leslie's Sorry Division, and I just want to say I'm sorry, Chris."
Leslie Knope,"Some people say he's still alive because they never found the body, but they never found the body because he exploded on impact."
Leslie Knope,"He resigned because of corruption and racketeering, and then he died from an overdose of pills."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that is not a valid reason."
Leslie Knope,"No, not really."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fluoride is safe, it is good for you, and almost every town in America uses it."
Leslie Knope,But that was in a romantic way.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,Why did we come out here?
Leslie Knope,You don't have to apologize.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,I know it's more than one word.
Leslie Knope,I am not deliberately losing.
Leslie Knope,I'll take your picture.
Leslie Knope,Let's meet Mayor Knudson.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, go over there."
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,I'm having a very off night.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"You want a word, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"Because she thinks you're cute, and I was afraid you guys were gonna make out and have babies, and I had no right to do that to you or your future children."
Leslie Knope,I have a word for you.
Leslie Knope,"I will do anything I can to get Jamm's vote so that he will keep this course open, and it will be good for the community stop!"
Leslie Knope,And it wasn't until just now that I realized the romantic part of our relationship is over.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,So I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I am shocked an appalled by the actions of the honorable delegate from Peru.
Leslie Knope,"No, we can't because in a few short years, we're gonna be visiting Jerry here, and he will have achieved nothing."
Leslie Knope,Do you realize what you have done?
Leslie Knope,This isn't what people want.
Leslie Knope,This is me.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, what, are we gonna stand around all day and listen to Ron spout off unrelated facts about blah, blah, blah, or are we gonna play?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, okay."
Leslie Knope,I got cut out of my own treaty?
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,It's like the Toy Story 3 of places.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'll figure something out."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm not really into breakfast foods."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi, Gayle."
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep thinks you're cute.
Leslie Knope,I just popped by to apologize and to give you something.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,I just need
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, he's gonna win."
Leslie Knope,So are you guys ready to polish off this treaty?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me?"
Leslie Knope,Most people speak English.
Leslie Knope,It's an aquatic based social media oral experience.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is amazing, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, kids love it, adults love it, Jamm loves it."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted your last day at work to be special, and I feel like I let you down."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys."
Leslie Knope,50%?
Leslie Knope,I'm back.
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,"Or, as they say in Denmark ""I'm back."""
Leslie Knope,toast.
Leslie Knope,You haven't?
Leslie Knope,Everybody loves it.
Leslie Knope,"I have gathered you all here today because I have an announcement, a very big announcement about my future."
Leslie Knope,All he has is fearmongering.
Leslie Knope,"On my side, I have facts, science, and reason."
Leslie Knope,Do you have a second?
Leslie Knope,Can't you just let me have this one?
Leslie Knope,I can't.
Leslie Knope,I talked to everyone in the entire state who's ever run a campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Nobody wants a candidate who's polling at ""last milkshake sip"" levels."
Leslie Knope,"Newport, we meet at last."
Leslie Knope,"Our polling shows that 72% of citizens are in favor of adding Tdazzle to their water, effectively killing Councilman Jamm's so-called Clean Water Bill."
Leslie Knope,One year you said one year.
Leslie Knope,That's on the record.
Leslie Knope,"Eat it, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"And the plan is I'm going to run for his seat because how do I lose to a guy like that? That's a great idea, right?"
Leslie Knope,You did it!
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,"Bobby Newport, heir to the sweetums candy fortune."
Leslie Knope,"Speech, speech, speech."
Leslie Knope,I did it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry!"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Well, never mind then."
Leslie Knope,"It's obvious, with all your glances and your sly smiles."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Jamm's not going to be able to kill this reservoir merger, is he?"
Leslie Knope,One hundred?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That can't be right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, what we do is we move forward from this."
Leslie Knope,How do we put a positive spin on this?
Leslie Knope,Game on.
Leslie Knope,Sure there is.
Leslie Knope,You're looking at the glass like it's 99% empty.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking at it like it's 1% full.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the last delicious sip of a milkshake at the bottom of the metal milkshakey thing?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like you're so pure and chaste."
Leslie Knope,"Please, I know the two of you are sleeping together."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Mr."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I am running again with or without you.
Leslie Knope,"I admit, I can't take it anymore."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Why don't you be Finland?
Leslie Knope,"We have fun when we collaborate, right?"
Leslie Knope,Working together?
Leslie Knope,"Lockbox, right?"
Leslie Knope,"It's it's bronze, babe."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,"Glen, you're killing me."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice homecooked meal, and do what comes naturally."
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, that was pretty fun up there."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, how about Japan?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team."
Leslie Knope,"I need them, please."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,You want to be Lex Luthor?
Leslie Knope,"Well, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, babe."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, will you be Iceland?"
Leslie Knope,I need a few more volunteers.
Leslie Knope,I can't argue with that.
Leslie Knope,You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.
Leslie Knope,So I did Zuko for you.
Leslie Knope,Dubee doo dubee doo dubee dubee dubee dow
Leslie Knope,"Well, she was good, you know what I mean?"
Leslie Knope,You have really immersed yourself in Asian culture.
Leslie Knope,Now I think maybe we should revisit the holding bond idea.
Leslie Knope,I'll let you be America.
Leslie Knope,Look!
Leslie Knope,You wanna join us?
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait until Monday."
Leslie Knope,I need to close this deal now.
Leslie Knope,So I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,"Uh summer heat boy and girl meet but ah, oh, those summer nights"
Leslie Knope,Let's have a change of venue and keep negotiating while we have fun.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,The eagle-- We should go.
Leslie Knope,"If I remember correctly, you enjoy the ancient art of karaoke, yes?"
Leslie Knope,I remembered your favorite duet.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time to take this party to Rydell High.
Leslie Knope,"No, you're gonna be South Africa or Pakistan."
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to hear your Travolta.
Leslie Knope,She got friendly down in the sand
Leslie Knope,"You be South Africa, and you can also secretly run the moon."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Now you give me the lockbox.
Leslie Knope,I want to get started now.
Leslie Knope,And I know you guys are talking about moving.
Leslie Knope,"But I guess I thought if maybe Ann came back from Michigan tomorrow, and I was able to look into her smoky, ethnically ambiguous eyes and tell her that we were breaking ground on a new park, she might... she might want to stay."
Leslie Knope,"We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do."
Leslie Knope,Ann arbor sounds disgusting.
Leslie Knope,What is great about it?
Leslie Knope,"Answer your phone, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the real key has been inside you all along."
Leslie Knope,"You know, the key is just a metaphor."
Leslie Knope,This is going to be fine.
Leslie Knope,They wanted to get it engraved.
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you're feeling better.
Leslie Knope,And a sled is a stupid mascot.
Leslie Knope,"You know, screw you, Partridge."
Leslie Knope,"But Ben Wyatt is better than all of you because he cared about this town, and he tried to help it."
Leslie Knope,Judy Garland's amazing.
Leslie Knope,That's crazy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ben Wyatt's better than Lee Janzen, and he's better than Judy Garland."
Leslie Knope,Who's Lee Janzen?
Leslie Knope,Judy Garland's from Partridge?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, they took it back."
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait a year."
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,You worked so hard.
Leslie Knope,I want construction started on Monday.
Leslie Knope,It's not good enough!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I sang your stupid song, I ate your stupid fake Asian food, and by the way, you should know, you don't make sushi rolls out of tuna salad"
Leslie Knope,"I did practically everything you wanted, and you won't just give this to me today?"
Leslie Knope,"I'll be Denmark, you be Peru."
Leslie Knope,Screw you!
Leslie Knope,You're giving a card to me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,It's so unfair.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,This is about Ann.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Commons is why I met Ann five years ago.
Leslie Knope,I had no right to disparage your town.
Leslie Knope,"Let me start by apologizing, mayor Stice."
Leslie Knope,We're going to city hall.
Leslie Knope,Tuck in your shirt.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna make one more stop before we leave.
Leslie Knope,"And for your hometown to treat you this way is just You know what, screw this."
Leslie Knope,You've done so many great things.
Leslie Knope,"Can't you just give Ben a key to the city, here, now, in your office, where no one will know your shame?"
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we name part of the park the ""Jamm Zone""?"
Leslie Knope,"Bonjour, Madame Ambassadeur."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea."
Leslie Knope,Uhohh.
Leslie Knope,Why would you think Harris would be the best candidate?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Donna, you took a look at all the resumes, so send in the best candidate."
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, you're passionate about animals."
Leslie Knope,You are talented
Leslie Knope,Let me talk to her.
Leslie Knope,"April, this is city council candidate Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Do not make any trouble.
Leslie Knope,Sit tight.
Leslie Knope,Does that mean
Leslie Knope,I'm on my way.
Leslie Knope,Chris Traeger can do more with one foot than most people can do with three.
Leslie Knope,She'd already hung up on me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm going to go down there and get them out, because men in uniform love me."
Leslie Knope,"I have to say, this is the greatest search committee ever assembled to find a new Animal Control Department head."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, I am not leaving until I get that lockbox."
Leslie Knope,You have to get Pistol Pete to make that shot.
Leslie Knope,I think I can handle it.
Leslie Knope,Scrambled eggs eaten with chopsticks?
Leslie Knope,He's our surprise headliner.
Leslie Knope,April Ludgate is beautiful
Leslie Knope,The whole town loves him.
Leslie Knope,So why do you want this job?
Leslie Knope,"Got ourselves a sleeping bag, a giant tin of caramel corn, and an irregular skirt from DKNY."
Leslie Knope,"Who's that, Michelle Wie?"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Because in that picture, she's wearing a bikini."
Leslie Knope,Sorry?
Leslie Knope,Get out.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for applying, now leave."
Leslie Knope,But the past is great.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Orin."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"The hem is crooked, but it was 8 bucks."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming in.
Leslie Knope,Fantastic.
Leslie Knope,"The jitterbug, stagecoaches, Herman Munster."
Leslie Knope,Let's not talk about dunking anymore.
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about what you want to do.
Leslie Knope,I think you want to dunk.
Leslie Knope,Why don't we all hit the hay?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, so you're not even technically qualified to work at your current job."
Leslie Knope,"We'll stay here, get a good night's sleep, and we can start negotiations tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,We stopped at the outlet mall on the way here.
Leslie Knope,This may not be the job for you.
Leslie Knope,I'm polling at 1%.
Leslie Knope,"He must dunk, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Do whatever it takes.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,This place is a miserable suck hole run by two pothead losers.
Leslie Knope,They're great at ingesting and selling marijuana.
Leslie Knope,"We have a massive pest problem in this town, and it's because the Animal Control Department has been disaster at catching animals."
Leslie Knope,Is that what's happening here?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Run! Run!
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm not giving it back to Stice."
Leslie Knope,"Although, I am a little offended that you wouldn't do that for me."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Screw that guy.
Leslie Knope,I stole it from mayor Stice's office.
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,I got you something.
Leslie Knope,That's not a great story.
Leslie Knope,I'd go with icon.
Leslie Knope,I really wouldn't describe myself as a Model UN legend.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,You know what might put you in the mood to talk is a couple of brewskis and a calendar featuring some of your favorite female wrestlers.
Leslie Knope,You should have it.
Leslie Knope,That's where I draw the line.
Leslie Knope,It's completely and utterly mismanaged.
Leslie Knope,You're the people you would be calling.
Leslie Knope,"You know, anything short of sexual favors."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Or hero.
Leslie Knope,"I do not I repeat, I do not want you to tempt him with sexual favors."
Leslie Knope,"You know, maybe we should negotiate while we're eating."
Leslie Knope,"Good, I wouldn't either."
Leslie Knope,"""Boring"" is my middle name, so my thoroughly vetted candidate is going to blow your candidate out of the water."
Leslie Knope,"I'm going to find a candidate, and I encourage you all to do the same, and then, we will interview all of them."
Leslie Knope,We are going to be thorough.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is how departments get mismanaged.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Milton's asleep, but the rest of you?"
Leslie Knope,You guys are all fine with this?
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,I think we should open this to the floor for more discussion.
Leslie Knope,I was being sarcastic.
Leslie Knope,Are his gums great too?
Leslie Knope,"Gosh, Jeremy, he sounds perfect."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so our new director needs to be competent, effective, and not completely stoned all the time."
Leslie Knope,Jerry Gergich got his start there.
Leslie Knope,Animal control has long been a repository for some of this government's most incompetent employees.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, Ben Wyatt is the best thing to ever come out of this crap town."
Leslie Knope,"You can still dunk, right?"
Leslie Knope,He has a calcified rock lodged in his penis!
Leslie Knope,Be able to forgive him.
Leslie Knope,Already did.
Leslie Knope,"End of World, May 20th."
Leslie Knope,That is free.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ingrid is settled into my office, and this box contains the last of my stuff."
Leslie Knope,We're sisters now.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, get used to it."
Leslie Knope,That's so cute.
Leslie Knope,Did he make you watch star war movies?
Leslie Knope,"So was, like, Ben a bossy older brother?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh hey, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Although I might have left some salt packets in my desk.
Leslie Knope,My cards got out of order here when they fell.
Leslie Knope,"Together, we can defeat obese children."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure that was something positive, originally."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, okay, this is just a disaster, isn't it? This is the worst political event ever in history."
Leslie Knope,"Well, um, I can assure you people in the bleachers that, if you follow my campaign, it will be interesting."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Pistol Pete!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, we're so happy to have you."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should go back for those?
Leslie Knope,But not the kind that snaps in half maybe.
Leslie Knope,"As a loyal pawneean, I've always been proud of this town, and, I, oh, um, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,Have you seen my complete collection of all 193 national flags? Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Here they are.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Well, somebody's nervous about the ceremony."
Leslie Knope,The point is I'm fine now.
Leslie Knope,You can form like a Trans-Asiatic alliance.
Leslie Knope,"Or I can be South Korea, you can be Bangladesh."
Leslie Knope,"It's just every time you say that speech, I think about where you've been and where you're going and our future children and America and just our history as a nation."
Leslie Knope,"Who were Ben's high school girlfriends, and what base do you think he got to?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I wonder if I'm gonna make it awesome.
Leslie Knope,"And if I don't make it awesome, they may cancel it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I appreciate the sentiment."
Leslie Knope,Attendance has been low.
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,Just have a few questions.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"So, I've been asked to run this year's Model UN at Pawnee Central High School."
Leslie Knope,"Now that you're both here, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,Was I singing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road out loud?
Leslie Knope,What is your life?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,There he goes.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Tonight's film is The Sound Of Music.
Leslie Knope,There will be free screenings followed by a discussion led by local film buff Dennis Lerpiss.
Leslie Knope,"Although we are all sad and deeply grossed out that the Pawnee Videodome is turning into a porno palace, I am happy to announce that the Pawnee government will be hosting a weekly movie night here at the Community Center."
Leslie Knope,"I would suggest sticking around and watching him eat it 'cause it only takes four minutes, and it's pretty amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money."
Leslie Knope,"well, math is hard."
Leslie Knope,Not after someone beats him in the next election.
Leslie Knope,Someone who is smart and hardworking and who knows the job because she's done it already and is also blonde and named Leslie and loves you!
Leslie Knope,He wrote this down.
Leslie Knope,You don't say.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to run again.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, gosh, I'm as disappointed as you are, Herb."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to beat Dexhart!
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,I challenge you to find one flaw in my plan.
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, but we can go and rent a second apartment, and we can spend 51% of our time there, and then I'll file the campaign form from that address."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's not that bad."
Leslie Knope,So what?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Pete! Oh!"
Leslie Knope,He's reading this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is the wrong movie."
Leslie Knope,How does he find the time?
Leslie Knope,Town hero!
Leslie Knope,"Pistol Pete, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"Yay, Ben!"
Leslie Knope,"Now they've invited him back as a gesture of goodwill, and he'll finally get some closure on this miserable chapter in his life."
Leslie Knope,"When Ben was mayor, he sunk all of the town's money into a winter sports complex called ""Ice Town,"" and they went bankrupt."
Leslie Knope,You're so sexy when you talk about percentages.
Leslie Knope,"They gave the key to every other mayor in the town's history, and I guarantee that none of them had as cute a butt as you do."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it took so long.
Leslie Knope,And action.
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Leslie Knope,I have chills.
Leslie Knope,"That is the exact spot where an 18 year old Ben Wyatt was inaugurated as mayor of Partridge, Minnesota."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, and freeze."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, move a little bit to your left and then turn to the side."
Leslie Knope,This is not how it happened.
Leslie Knope,Shut it down.
Leslie Knope,"Um, oh, on the 19th we can't give you the park."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's see what we've got."
Leslie Knope,"We shut this down, please."
Leslie Knope,We have a Spring spectacular free ice cream giveaway.
Leslie Knope,How many stages is that?
Leslie Knope,"But you know, luckily for me, I've processed all my feelings, and I've gone through the five stages of grief: denial, anger, Internet commenting, cat adoption, African dance, cat returning to the adoption place, watching all the episodes of Murphy Brown and not giving a flying fart."
Leslie Knope,Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Mm-mm.
Leslie Knope,"And who sides with Lex Luthor, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,You probably watch Million Dollar Baby and root for the stool.
Leslie Knope,I am leaving now.
Leslie Knope,I am not moving.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going home.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it would be even faster if the governor would return my calls about my Pawnee to Ann arbor bullet train idea."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think I burned that bridge with Jamm."
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna get that lockbox.
Leslie Knope,And I am not singing Beauty School Dropout.
Leslie Knope,"There is no Gambit here, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"It's sexist, and I don't do slow jams."
Leslie Knope,Is he going to dunk for me?
Leslie Knope,He's crying?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"We should cancel it, right?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should cancel it?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Jerry You were in charge of getting a crowd.
Leslie Knope,"Please tell me that you pulled a Jerry, and no one's here."
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you?"
Leslie Knope,It's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the stupid state is split up into two pieces!"
Leslie Knope,But it was very meaningful that you were gonna finally
Leslie Knope,"And, sure, my husband made an honest mistake 20 years ago."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no word from Ann."
Leslie Knope,"April, I need a status report."
Leslie Knope,How's it looking out there?
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?"
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What happened?
Leslie Knope,"I would like to point out that we drove all the way here from Pawnee, Indiana, a city with some class, by the way."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a typo."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, excuse me."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how's the stage coming?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,There's no JJ's Diner there.
Leslie Knope,"Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just realizing now that's not a typo.
Leslie Knope,"That says ""Ice Clown."""
Leslie Knope,"Good, where is he?"
Leslie Knope,That's a major typo.
Leslie Knope,"There's no ""Welcome to Pawnee"" sign."
Leslie Knope,And it's water.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, stay away from sharp things."
Leslie Knope,Town mascot is here.
Leslie Knope,It seems pretty fun and festive.
Leslie Knope,Is this for realskis?
Leslie Knope,"Let's go back to plan ""A."""
Leslie Knope,"Amen, brother."
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is the Pawnee City Council Chambers."
Leslie Knope,Your new home away from home.
Leslie Knope,Today is my last day as City-- Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Let me try this again.
Leslie Knope,"Today is my last day asâ¦ Today is my last-- Today is my last day... You know what, you get the idea."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm currently in deep denial that that's happening."
Leslie Knope,"My old friend Ingrid De Forest won the recall vote, and she's taking my place on Monday morning."
Leslie Knope,Is there anything that we can do?
Leslie Knope,We have a ceremony we need to be at in two hours.
Leslie Knope,Kidney stone?
Leslie Knope,Ron? Ron? There's no stairs.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,How do I get onto the stage? Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I'll call mayor Stice, and we'll reschedule the ceremony."
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Are you sure you're okay with what you did?
Leslie Knope,Jamm is gonna be so pissed when he finds out that you're leaving and your I.O.U.s are worthless.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish you were here."
Leslie Knope,"I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, everybody listen up."
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to say thank you.
Leslie Knope,"You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm going to go out there, and I'm going to announce the relaunch, and I'm going to muddle through this thing as best I can."
Leslie Knope,"You should all leave, and when this thing is over, I'll meet you at the nearest bar."
Leslie Knope,You want me to come back to the hospital?
Leslie Knope,"And to tell you the truth, I'm doing it all for my best friend."
Leslie Knope,Everything okay?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,But the good news is I'm here to accept the key on his behalf.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I took a video of him at the hospital an hour ago."
Leslie Knope,Let's give this crowd a show.
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Everybody smile and wave.
Leslie Knope,"Well, vote passed."
Leslie Knope,3-2.
Leslie Knope,"He's in the hospital, sir."
Leslie Knope,You win.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you come out, and you dunk the ball, and you say, ""Voting for Leslie Knope is a slam dunk!"""
Leslie Knope,"That means we should have shoes then, right?"
Leslie Knope,This is horrifying.
Leslie Knope,"Take a look at Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Go ahead, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Let me have it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, I'll do it for you."
Leslie Knope,"I told you so, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Rat.
Leslie Knope,This is what happens when the government interferes with business.
Leslie Knope,"Government is bad, business is good."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the closest thing I could get to a rat."
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you're gonna love what I'm churning up."
Leslie Knope,He has that look in his eye that Ben gets when he plays Risk.
Leslie Knope,I just don't think he's ever gonna quit.
Leslie Knope,"Man, this guy's tougher than I thought."
Leslie Knope,Indeed.
Leslie Knope,Might get a little rough in there.
Leslie Knope,Not allowed.
Leslie Knope,Antiperspirant?
Leslie Knope,Don't need to worry about rickets.
Leslie Knope,Cured.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Free market.
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you aren't supporting me on this.
Leslie Knope,"That is not a coincidence, this was meant to be."
Leslie Knope,Still got it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I love the sound of silence before a big cheer."
Leslie Knope,"I am going to be running for Dexhart's seat, and the campaign starts now!"
Leslie Knope,I am officially seeking reelection to the Pawnee City Council.
Leslie Knope,I have a big announcement.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, gather around."
Leslie Knope,"Good, you guys are here."
Leslie Knope,"All I have on my side is facts and science, and people hate facts and science."
Leslie Knope,I thought he was gonna last an hour max.
Leslie Knope,Dexhart has a sex scandal the same day I'm leaving office?
Leslie Knope,How long was that under there?
Leslie Knope,Do you guys feel that?
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's that?"
Leslie Knope,Not a chance.
Leslie Knope,How long is he planning on staying here?
Leslie Knope,He planted an entire field of barley.
Leslie Knope,Garth really knows his stuff.
Leslie Knope,I think I'm in over my head.
Leslie Knope,Nobody eat that.
Leslie Knope,Now you're talking!
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I like capitalism.
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,It was a more primitive time.
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm going to start my negative PR blitz against Dexhart and"
Leslie Knope,"I've got plenty of dirt on that scumbag, I say bring it on."
Leslie Knope,"The point is is that our Founding Fathers were brilliant and they were courageous, but they also had wooden teeth and pooped in holes in the ground."
Leslie Knope,You bought XMen pajamas?
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Underexaggerate much, France?"
Leslie Knope,"Three times, ""Employee Of The Fortnight."""
Leslie Knope,Anything is worth me getting back on City Council.
Leslie Knope,"'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won."
Leslie Knope,I absolutely do.
Leslie Knope,Go get Tom.
Leslie Knope,"""The Comeback Kid."""
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Clyde."
Leslie Knope,Run! Get Tom!
Leslie Knope,Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things about Sweetums and their great new product.
Leslie Knope,"By ""jackbooted storm troopers,"" do you mean the Pawnee Police Department?"
Leslie Knope,"But when I looked at the research, I found some pretty compelling facts about Drink-ems that made me change my tune."
Leslie Knope,"Robert Downey, Jr."
Leslie Knope,I used to give tours at the Pawnee Historical House.
Leslie Knope,Rickets?
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's just because people found out he was Miley Cyrus' cousin."
Leslie Knope,"No, settle up."
Leslie Knope,Extensive knowledge about early prairie life?
Leslie Knope,Check.
Leslie Knope,Oldtimey dress?
Leslie Knope,There's no way I'm losing this contest.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for volunteering.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, Tom, you will be our referees."
Leslie Knope,Nothing can be used that was invented past 1817.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, let's put all modern devices in this pail."
Leslie Knope,Did you sleep here last night?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Shauna, no."
Leslie Knope,Yikes.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Well, they couldn't make a banner in time for my press conference, so I am cobbling together a banner from all the other discarded banners."
Leslie Knope,I love competition.
Leslie Knope,I'm more competitive than you.
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"I win, you stop this nonsense."
Leslie Knope,"How about you and I go live in that historical house, no modern technology, If you last longer, I withdraw my bill."
Leslie Knope,How about a little wager?
Leslie Knope,I think there's some pretty cool things from back then.
Leslie Knope,"That's what's happening, right?"
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,"No, we didn't."
Leslie Knope,"So, my campaign ends and, just like that, you find someone else and run theirs?"
Leslie Knope,Num num num num num.
Leslie Knope,You can't punish Ben for something I did.
Leslie Knope,It's not fair.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, buddy."
Leslie Knope,"I love him, and I will do anything to help him get his job back."
Leslie Knope,This guy has no friends.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Because, sister, you look good enough to eat."
Leslie Knope,Let's just look at his browser history and his inbox and his outbox and his Facebook page.
Leslie Knope,That's an invasion of his privacy.
Leslie Knope,"Good luck, but, uh, I just had a big meeting with my new advisory board, and they're brilliant and amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now let's not read anything."
Leslie Knope,Can you just tread water until I'm ready?
Leslie Knope,I'm not really sure.
Leslie Knope,"""So let's all raise a glass, full of delicious, sugary drinking water, to Sweetums-- a Pawnee Institution."""
Leslie Knope,They're real killers.
Leslie Knope,"I have to, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Can we just press pause here?
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Did you do something to your hair?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're fired."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you're right."
Leslie Knope,You will.
Leslie Knope,You're that good of a nurse.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Ben is poison in my campaign.
Leslie Knope,Our relationship is the reason why my advisors pulled out.
Leslie Knope,"I Ann, don't listen to your head or your heart."
Leslie Knope,"Just look at my eyes and say ""yes."""
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"I believe in you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,And your first job as my campaign manager is to start dressing like one.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to have this conversation again.
Leslie Knope,Whatcha whittling?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there, Garth."
Leslie Knope,"William, Elizabeth."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,What are you Are you coming to see me?
Leslie Knope,Did you hear that I'm relaunching my campaign?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jessica!"
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Leslie Knope,We can't both be out of a job.
Leslie Knope,I'll be right in.
Leslie Knope,Um They want me to do a photo op for the campaign so I can bolster my education credentials.
Leslie Knope,"""And therefore, with your help, we can make our future bright."
Leslie Knope,That analogy was way better in my head.
Leslie Knope,That's why we've moved on.
Leslie Knope,No one.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, William."
Leslie Knope,"God, that sounds horrible."
Leslie Knope,"I know that, but--"
Leslie Knope,Are you sure?
Leslie Knope,It's like he's getting stronger the longer he stays here.
Leslie Knope,"""I believe I still have a lot to offer this city."""
Leslie Knope,It's not gonna make a difference.
Leslie Knope,"What the hell do you know, dumdum?"
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you think I should do?"
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I can't beat them.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you have always given me sage counsel, and your words carry great influence."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And hire you.
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, my campaign manager and I have made a decision."
Leslie Knope,"All of you, look, this is my only option."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I stormed out.
Leslie Knope,"What will we do-- sleep all day, take cooking classes together, sit on a couch and watch movies?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't need luck."
Leslie Knope,We are a rocket ship.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,We should check his phone.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's no way a man who's into XMen that much can stay away from the Internet that long."
Leslie Knope,He must have cheated somehow.
Leslie Knope,But to live like this is insane.
Leslie Knope,"It's so, so, so fun."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jen."
Leslie Knope,Please be my campaign manager.
Leslie Knope,You're the only one that can save us.
Leslie Knope,This team has a lot of heart and zero know-how.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if you're poison to my campaign.
Leslie Knope,"We are relaunching, and we're going to blast past your cann Huh, they're gone."
Leslie Knope,"It's true I no longer have highly trained, professional campaign managers."
Leslie Knope,So what?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"It's fun to be here on, like, a school field trip or something."
Leslie Knope,"Are most murders committed by highly trained, professional assassins?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,They're committed by friends and coworkers.
Leslie Knope,Repealing them would show that we're changing with the times.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was a truly depressing slate of candidates."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Blunden, look, the laws I'm trying to get rid of have no more relevance in modern society and they're embarrassing to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,This is exactly why we need to modernize these laws.
Leslie Knope,Ha ha!
Leslie Knope,"What, are you trying to build a house with those bricks?"
Leslie Knope,Boyfriends just love you and marry you.
Leslie Knope,Very good point.
Leslie Knope,"I agree, April."
Leslie Knope,Damentally a substance that should not be abused.
Leslie Knope,They drive you to the airport.
Leslie Knope,And friendship is better because friends help you move.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we're amazing friends."
Leslie Knope,When do you go back to work again?
Leslie Knope,But Ben and I have so much in common.
Leslie Knope,"Due to my campaign, the romantic aspect of our relationship is over."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, don't even joke about that."
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, have fun."
Leslie Knope,"Security Council, we need you to lead us, or billions of people will starve to death."
Leslie Knope,You've all been preparing for months for this year's geopolitical scenario global food crisis.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I have one the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,"The money for the Pawnee Commons, aka the greatest future park in the world, aka my personal dream project is currently in a discretionary fund."
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to move it to a lockbox, to ensure that it is used for that project."
Leslie Knope,And I'm totally fine with that.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, now I do."
Leslie Knope,What is this called again?
Leslie Knope,Grab that gavel and break your other foot.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I'm feeling it!"
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna break dance!
Leslie Knope,"Look at that, April."
Leslie Knope,Coming!
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"That was a brilliant idea from a dark, tortured genius, and I move that Animal Control be absorbed into Parks and Rec."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope he kept a receipt."
Leslie Knope,History is being made.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all we need is some kind of distraction."
Leslie Knope,Somebody wake up Milton.
Leslie Knope,He does have good teeth.
Leslie Knope,I say we just withdraw your application and let Vern become director.
Leslie Knope,I'm breaking up with the idea of you being director of Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,"It's not you, it's me."
Leslie Knope,"You are doing terribly up there, and it's all my fault."
Leslie Knope,"I am so sorry, April."
Leslie Knope,Okay! Let's take a brief recess.
Leslie Knope,Maybe she can pull this off.
Leslie Knope,Don't panic.
Leslie Knope,That is a genius idea.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, tell everybody in Michigan I said hi, and tell your mom that I love the banana cake she posted on Pinterest."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,That is an insane statement.
Leslie Knope,"Ribs are better smoked than grilled, so unnailed it, with the back part of the hammer."
Leslie Knope,Do you have any experience with animals?
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Palletta, what is your occupation currently?"
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,The phone is hung up.
Leslie Knope,You got my message about Jamm being a dinkhead?
Leslie Knope,"Fine, but his is the dinkiest."
Leslie Knope,And I would know because I'm keeping score.
Leslie Knope,"April, I got a present for you."
Leslie Knope,"Ever since I started city council, I have gone head-to-head with Jamm 112 times."
Leslie Knope,I will not lose our last battle.
Leslie Knope,Will you help me?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"The way you stood up like that, I thought it was gonna go a different way."
Leslie Knope,We're not done talking about the lockbox.
Leslie Knope,This isn't over.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know we have had our differences, but this is very important to me."
Leslie Knope,And I'm not leaving until we hash this out.
Leslie Knope,"""No shoes, you lose""?"
Leslie Knope,"He has won 56 times, I have won 56 times."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, the father of your child is here."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"On an unrelated note, do you remember all those candidates we were interviewing for the Animal Control job and how they were all total losers who didn't care about animals?"
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please."
Leslie Knope,Please do this.
Leslie Knope,Climb into my papoose.
Leslie Knope,"I filled the bottles with fake blood, vinegar, and mud."
Leslie Knope,I will be your Pocahontas.
Leslie Knope,What's your name?
Leslie Knope,Let's practice.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's easy they'll just ask you a few questions."
Leslie Knope,You are so good with animals.
Leslie Knope,"April, please, you will be so good at it."
Leslie Knope,Surprise.
Leslie Knope,"Anyhoo, I nominated you for the position, and your confirmation hearing is in three minutes."
Leslie Knope,I'll talk to you soon.
Leslie Knope,"Except for Jerry, who was great, but who we had to pass on for other reasons."
Leslie Knope,"I will be there to help you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,This rally is going to be awesome.
Leslie Knope,My campaign team is unstoppable.
Leslie Knope,Ann is killing it.
Leslie Knope,I have several binders with very important data that I need to get through.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, good news."
Leslie Knope,But I'm gonna quote me back to you and say that Ted Party Day will never change.
Leslie Knope,You're quoting me back to me.
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ted."
Leslie Knope,"And obviously they meant ""American Indian."""
Leslie Knope,Drink-ems is dead.
Leslie Knope,"As of tomorrow, every Pawnee resident will have H-2-flow in their drinking water."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,"I'll double-check with Tom, but I'm, like, 95% sure."
Leslie Knope,"And you and I-- we always land on our feet, right?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I just think you need to be careful about speculating what the Founders meant when they were writing the town charter.
Leslie Knope,That's the way it's always been done.
Leslie Knope,"And we have the right, nay, the obligation, to dump Ted into the lake every year."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ted Party Day is protected by Article Two in the town charter."
Leslie Knope,Three!
Leslie Knope,Two!
Leslie Knope,That is an outdated and racist law.
Leslie Knope,One!
Leslie Knope,What the--
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait a minute."
Leslie Knope,He can do this.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, he's right."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"That section defines ""Buffalo meat"" as acceptable currency."
Leslie Knope,Shall we proceed to a vote?
Leslie Knope,Your objection is noted and officially in the record.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you're constructing the stage?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, a lot of passion, Mr. Blunden."
Leslie Knope,How does 136.086 grab you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, here we go."
Leslie Knope,"The bill that I have written with the full support of the city council will repeal 110 obsolete laws such as all menstruating women shall be confined to their bathtubs and Article Two, aka, Ted Party Day."
Leslie Knope,"I now realize that I was wrong, and it's time that we purged the books of many of our town's outdated and obscure laws."
Leslie Knope,Each Drink-ems is packed with 35% of your daily monopotassium phosphate requirement.
Leslie Knope,Would that help you?
Leslie Knope,MPP is an emulsifier as well as a plus-7 PH buffer.
Leslie Knope,What if we dropped interest rates.
Leslie Knope,I think I have it.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know what you're thinking-- what about its molar mass?"
Leslie Knope,I was not aware of that statute.
Leslie Knope,The floor is now open for public comments.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we get to go find a guy named Ted and throw him in a lake."
Leslie Knope,It's just one of those little things that reminds us of Pawnee's rich and vibrant past.
Leslie Knope,"Historical fun fact when the Founding Fathers wrote the charter, their oldtimey script made one of the ""a""s look like a ""d,"" so ""tea"" became ""Ted."""
Leslie Knope,"In 1992, Pistol Pete's last second dunk against Eagleton High clinched a comeback victory for the Pawnee Central drunken savages."
Leslie Knope,Team mascot later changed.
Leslie Knope,I had it made your first week here.
Leslie Knope,Ta da.
Leslie Knope,"April, I have a gift for you."
Leslie Knope,"We can call you Pistol, right?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, got it."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Ann got local hero Pistol Pete Disellio to endorse me at the rally.
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,We overlapped a year at Pawnee Central.
Leslie Knope,You probably remember my voice from the morning announcements.
Leslie Knope,"This is my campaign manager, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, again."
Leslie Knope,You won over Jamm.
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"The last time he was in between jobs, he got deep into claymation, so this should be different, hopefully."
Leslie Knope,We're excited to have you.
Leslie Knope,Thanks to me.
Leslie Knope,I still can't believe that you got him.
Leslie Knope,"I knew you'd be going places, so I wanted to be prepared."
Leslie Knope,Not yet.
Leslie Knope,"Today is Ted Party Day, where we commemorate the great Pawnee tea dump of 1817."
Leslie Knope,Does anyone object?
Leslie Knope,You look like a real campaign manager.
Leslie Knope,"Article Two, Section Two of the Pawnee Charter reads, ""Be it decreed: Should the taxation of tea ""rise to an unacceptable level, citizens shall dump Ted into Ramsett Lake."""
Leslie Knope,"See, there's more things to look at on the Internet besides naked guys, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,"I need a team update, campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Things are already looking up.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Miss Daisy."
Leslie Knope,I wasn't going to.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, right, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"April had the best idea, and today the best idea won."
Leslie Knope,It should operate based on good ideas.
Leslie Knope,Government shouldn't operate based on personal favors.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This kind of thing made sense when we had council in a barn and there were but now this is nuts.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that you had started.
Leslie Knope,A couple of announcements.
Leslie Knope,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,"Are you hugging me, or are we fighting?"
Leslie Knope,So you do think I'm annoying.
Leslie Knope,Now who's annoying?
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope is stepping up at these hearings and taking a bullet for me."""
Leslie Knope,Are you hugging or fighting?
Leslie Knope,Let me know.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll put one slug back."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that great?
Leslie Knope,"""Exemplary""?"
Leslie Knope,That's the word we were thinking of.
Leslie Knope,"You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,"Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs."
Leslie Knope,"Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia."
Leslie Knope,Then don't say it.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Gretel! Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,April
Leslie Knope,"Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone?"
Leslie Knope,Don't pinch me!
Leslie Knope,"Either way, your problem is solved."
Leslie Knope,Ohh.
Leslie Knope,"That's not why we do this, April."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, Ben and I have been dating on and off for about a year."
Leslie Knope,"You of all people should know that, El Diablo!"
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know anymore.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for trying."
Leslie Knope,I have a question for you.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm annoying?
Leslie Knope,Are you lying?
Leslie Knope,Sometimes I get competitive.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,He was one of the greatest men in history.
Leslie Knope,"Terryville sucks old car tires, and so does Martin Luther No, he does not suck old car tires."
Leslie Knope,"Park in Terryville, but guess what?"
Leslie Knope,"The title is currently held by Martin Luther King, Jr."
Leslie Knope,"Recently, the last remaining telephone booths in Pawnee were torn down, and on that patch of concrete, I am creating Pawnee's newest tourist attraction The smallest park in Indiana."
Leslie Knope,On to the next complaint.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs.
Leslie Knope,"Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all."
Leslie Knope,it is .000003 square miles.
Leslie Knope,Are you trying to protect my feelings?
Leslie Knope,"We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause."
Leslie Knope,"Our research shows that our park will draw and I want this to be the most amazing, awe inspiring, fun filled park ever conceived."
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm being annoying right now?
Leslie Knope,I know it's Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Stay away from me, crab! I'm just kidding."
Leslie Knope,"So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab."
Leslie Knope,Are you tweeting this?
Leslie Knope,"What's the hashtag gonna be? ""Boss bitch"" or ""bitch boss""?"
Leslie Knope,"Eh, I don't hate that."
Leslie Knope,"They're right here! Well, we're not witches."
Leslie Knope,That's sexist and offensive.
Leslie Knope,"But we're right here, and we are not gonna sit in this room and let you drag our names through the mud just to score some cheap political points."
Leslie Knope,We have had enough.
Leslie Knope,"I am going back to work so I can do some good for this town, and my friend Donna is coming with me."
Leslie Knope,That's not okay.
Leslie Knope,"Really, councilman?"
Leslie Knope,That's gonna go on my permanent record.
Leslie Knope,Again?
Leslie Knope,I'm not the kind of person that has a permanent record.
Leslie Knope,"The recall election is coming up, and Jamm keeps trying to figure out ways to screw me over."
Leslie Knope,"But the problem is is that Tom came back and Andy's my assistant, so I kinda need him close to me."
Leslie Knope,"I understand that, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"For me, a slap on the wrist is like a kick to the nuts."
Leslie Knope,"Last week, he tried to have me listed on the ballot as ""Leslie Buttface Hitler the Fourth."""
Leslie Knope,What's gonna happen to you?
Leslie Knope,"All you're trying to do is disenfranchise the people from former Eagleton, people who will most likely vote for me because I saved a lot of their jobs."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Tom Haverford!"
Leslie Knope,"Now, I would like you to open each one in front of me, and tell me how you feel about them individually."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days."
Leslie Knope,"This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race."
Leslie Knope,I wish we could go through this together.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to get here early, you know, get a feel of the room."
Leslie Knope,So you got here at 3:00 A.M.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't sleep anyway.
Leslie Knope,"I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called ""Zapvigil,"" which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake."
Leslie Knope,Is that a present for me?
Leslie Knope,I'm so jet-lagged.
Leslie Knope,I'm so goofed-up right now.
Leslie Knope,Li'l Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,"Right, yeah, of course."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thank you so much for making my life so wonderful."
Leslie Knope,"My things are making friendship bracelets and dancing like nobody's watching, thinking up really cool nicknames for my friends."
Leslie Knope,"Are you sure you should be working? I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry if I can be little annoying at times, but one person's annoying is another person's inspiring and heroic, so, you know, who are we to judge?"
Leslie Knope,I can't promise that I won't be inspiring and heroic in the future.
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Leslie Knope,I got you an apology present.
Leslie Knope,"It is all of your favorite lipsticks and nail polishes, and I got the same ones too."
Leslie Knope,"I printed out a schedule, so we can wear them at the same time."
Leslie Knope,I was talking to him.
Leslie Knope,I am not gonna let you go.
Leslie Knope,But also to you.
Leslie Knope,"I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go."
Leslie Knope,"""hashtag sister from another mister, hashtag boss bitch."""
Leslie Knope,"""Swagger beats and I get the-- Who's the"" All right, forget it."
Leslie Knope,My thing is not being annoying.
Leslie Knope,You think I'm annoying?
Leslie Knope,"So, I have about nine things I need to talk to you about."
Leslie Knope,You guys want to delay all my bills?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna keep my head down and continue to get work done.
Leslie Knope,"Gahhh, you guys are the worst!"
Leslie Knope,It absolutely is personal.
Leslie Knope,"That is the definition of ""personal."""
Leslie Knope,It's probably just some bored teenager who hacked the account.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We think that you may have accidentally tweeted from the Parks and Rec account rather than your own personal account.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there's one more thing I want to try."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons."
Leslie Knope,There is another option.
Leslie Knope,"We could just say ""screw it"" and do this thing for real."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it."
Leslie Knope,I miss you like crazy.
Leslie Knope,"""See you tonight."""
Leslie Knope,"And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing."
Leslie Knope,The first is the ribbon cutting ceremony.
Leslie Knope,I think about you all the time.
Leslie Knope,Do you know who's bringing scissors?
Leslie Knope,Because I cannot tell you how many ceremonies get derailed when people don't bring scissors.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Your heart and your butt.
Leslie Knope,Just take it off.
Leslie Knope,I will not go negative.
Leslie Knope,Crap on a turd!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,The committee to recall Leslie Knope is relentless.
Leslie Knope,Look what they're handing out at elementary schools.
Leslie Knope,"We all know that I cannot spend as much money on ads as my opponent, but I printed out 10,000 ""Don't"" stickers and 10,000 question mark stickers."
Leslie Knope,Take it off.
Leslie Knope,"That way, if you see a sign and it says ""Recall Knope,"" all you need to do is add the question mark and the ""Don't,"" and suddenly, it reads, ""Recall Knope? Don't."""
Leslie Knope,Number two
Leslie Knope,"Yep, that's a much better idea."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"April, no!"
Leslie Knope,"I'm pleased to formally submit Bill 68J, which funds a new bike path in Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,Failed experiment.
Leslie Knope,"No, not sexy."
Leslie Knope,I also submit Bill 68R.
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Wear it for me.
Leslie Knope,"If you don't want to have any more contact with me, I finally understand."
Leslie Knope,I want to be with you.
Leslie Knope,"""Hope you like tongue baths, you big, nasty fireman."""
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Leslie Knope,How do you feel?
Leslie Knope,He is not gonna sully your name.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry about it, Donna."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna nip this in the bud.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's actually quite simple."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, a Parks and Rec employee forgot to log out of the Parks and Rec Twitter account, they posted a personal, of the Parks and Rec private message by accident, and, uh, that person is very sorry, and it won't happen again."
Leslie Knope,I just told you what happened.
Leslie Knope,It was an unfortunate mistake.
Leslie Knope,Not a word.
Leslie Knope,"Well, because I learned new information."
Leslie Knope,"When I was four, I thought that chocolate milk came from brown cows, and then I flip-flopped when I found out that there was something called chocolate syrup."
Leslie Knope,It's utterly meaningless.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, does anyone else here see a double standard?"
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart is currently being sued by two different women for sexual harassment, one of whom was the judge in the first woman's trial."
Leslie Knope,She was reading the emails that you sent to the first woman.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I don't even know what she writes on there!"
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let them fire you.
Leslie Knope,That's what you really think of me?
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,This is how I feel.
Leslie Knope,But I'm done steamrolling people.
Leslie Knope,"But I know how I feel, and I want to be with you."
Leslie Knope,"What's important is, we deleted the tweet, and nobody is gonna know it's you, but Donna, you know, be more careful in the future."
Leslie Knope,"But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing."
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,"So let's just say ""screw it."""
Leslie Knope,This could've really blew up in my face.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"No one is getting fired, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Jamm is trying to use this to hurt me in the recall.
Leslie Knope,"He's trying to take me down, and he's willing to attack my friends in the process?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,My thing?
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,You're getting hugged right now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, brother."
Leslie Knope,"Let's see, it is ""48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm giving you a hug.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"""He makes all the ladies want--"" No, I'm not gonna say that."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and Gentlemen, ""He was gone but never forgotten."""
Leslie Knope,I'm fighting.
Leslie Knope,You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.
Leslie Knope,"First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,You're up next.
Leslie Knope,How is Ben?
Leslie Knope,Is he sad?
Leslie Knope,"You need to cheer him up, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Uh yeah.
Leslie Knope,How was your meeting?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"One time, they made a pinata of my face, and then everybody in the town came and took turns hitting it with a stick, and they filled it with broccoli, just to add insult to injury but politics you know what I mean, right?"
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to kick me out of office.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Pawnee, Indiana, is a wonderful town, and I love it, but they hate me."
Leslie Knope,Is that goat cheese?
Leslie Knope,That makes no sense.
Leslie Knope,"There's no killer witness, because we didn't do anything wrong unless someone's planning to lie or slander us."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, just to be safe, find out who it is and silence him."
Leslie Knope,You go down in history as a frozen whore.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,But when you sit back and let your reputation be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,Get the key that's taped to the back of that picture.
Leslie Knope,It opens up my bottom desk drawer in there are some files pay attention.
Leslie Knope,Where are you looking?
Leslie Knope,"Look here, focus here."
Leslie Knope,"Get the files in the drawer, and then get all the file boxes in the office."
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,I wish I could move to Silkeborg and dance with a reindeer.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,They want to recall me.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Chris has 14 witnesses."
Leslie Knope,I need you to talk to all the department heads and find out who's gonna testify.
Leslie Knope,They hate me.
Leslie Knope,By hating me.
Leslie Knope,"And I love my town, but you know how they repay me?"
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,Cleaning slime out of rivers and removing slugs from people's front yards.
Leslie Knope,I need you to text me every 30 seconds that everything's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,And you know how I spend my days?
Leslie Knope,"You know, I've been a public servant for a long time."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're just truly"
Leslie Knope,"I broke one rule, and I will accept a slap on the wrist."
Leslie Knope,They made a statue of you!
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Let me make it clear.
Leslie Knope,what?
Leslie Knope,went from being friends to being so much more.
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Ben and I hooked up last night!
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,And I learned how to use iMovie.
Leslie Knope,Call me later!
Leslie Knope,Bye!
Leslie Knope,So what was the date you received that email?
Leslie Knope,"I voted for Mildred, my stuffed pig, but my cat, pancakes, won."
Leslie Knope,"That's all there is, really, is passion."
Leslie Knope,You have some perspective!
Leslie Knope,May 12th The day after we returned from Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,Easy breezy!
Leslie Knope,"Well, not to Indiana, but there's a 9:00 redeye to Lisbon, and then I can catch the 4:30 A.M. back to Edinburgh, connect through Houston, head on up to Cincinnati and then rent a car, drive around 90, and I'll be home two hours earlier than if I flew home as planned."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,But isn't it a
Leslie Knope,But I just put
Leslie Knope,"Tom, will you please tell the committee why we were kissing?"
Leslie Knope,But we never had any other romantic contact after that.
Leslie Knope,In a world on the brink of financial meltdown... In a town unlike any other An adorable man with a cute face and the future president of the United States
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you're right.
Leslie Knope,"Could you play the attachment, please?"
Leslie Knope,Don't silence him.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, what part of Denmark are you from?"
Leslie Knope,Just make sure he can't talk.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I am not willing to let you deprive me
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're from Denmark, of course."
Leslie Knope,It's just so symmetrical.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at your face."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a big cheering section."
Leslie Knope,Good everything.
Leslie Knope,Next to my desk is a picture of a female politician Bella Abzug.
Leslie Knope,Good friends.
Leslie Knope,I remember the first time I voted.
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Perkins, Chris Traeger has questioned when my relationship with Ben Wyatt began."
Leslie Knope,"I was in my bedroom, and I was five."
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to direct you to your inbox and specifically an email entitled ""yay""."
Leslie Knope,"That's YA and 18 ""Y""s and 44 exclamation points."
Leslie Knope,Let's go walk past Colin Firth's house again.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need to calm down."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'm stressed.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,Intriguing.
Leslie Knope,Passion is what makes for good treaties Good relationships Good pizza.
Leslie Knope,"They like me in Silkeborg more than my own hometown, and I've never even been there."
Leslie Knope,"I love Pawnee, but sometimes it sucks."
Leslie Knope,"The people can be very mean and ungrateful, and they cling to their fried dough and their big sodas, and then they get mad at me when their pants don't fit."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're radiating pure joy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I almost forgot."
Leslie Knope,She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.
Leslie Knope,"Well, April does that all the time."
Leslie Knope,And nobody ever thanks you.
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,But it's so hard!
Leslie Knope,I have to be the grownup.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"I freely admit to the relationship, and I will not be fighting the charges that we violated Chris' rule."
Leslie Knope,But we did nothing else wrong or unethical.
Leslie Knope,"In 1849, Sarah Nelson Quindle exposed her elbow outdoors, which was a class ""A"" felony."
Leslie Knope,"Although she felt the law unjust, she acknowledged that she had broken it, and she nobly accepted her punishment to be set adrift on Lake Michigan like a human popsicle."
Leslie Knope,Look how calm she looks.
Leslie Knope,That's how I feel totally zen.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.
Leslie Knope,"Last May, at your request, Ben and I drove to Indianapolis to bid for the state little league tournament."
Leslie Knope,The night we returned was the first time we kissed each other on each other's mouths.
Leslie Knope,"I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you do."
Leslie Knope,"If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed."
Leslie Knope,You seem like you're in a good mood.
Leslie Knope,Including wars.
Leslie Knope,I move that we table the discussion until after the election.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Leslie Knope,Thank you!
Leslie Knope,Marcus Everett Langley was Pawnee's greatest lawyer at the turn of the century.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,I just get excited when you like me.
Leslie Knope,"I put my career on the line by saving Eagleton, and he's trying to rob me of their votes?"
Leslie Knope,Those are my votes.
Leslie Knope,I've earned them!
Leslie Knope,It was excellent.
Leslie Knope,I want them!
Leslie Knope,I can't believe Jamm tried to pull that crap.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, do I?"
Leslie Knope,"Tonight, I am throwing Ben his dream birthday party, a roller skating bash with an early '90s theme."
Leslie Knope,Ben lives for the early '90s.
Leslie Knope,"The music, the fashion."
Leslie Knope,"His nickname was ""Old Stone Face"" because of his steely demeanor and because he got in an accident at the rock quarry and dynamite blew up his face."
Leslie Knope,It's his favorite era.
Leslie Knope,As for the roller skating
Leslie Knope,"There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops."
Leslie Knope,"This is London, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Give me those votes!
Leslie Knope,"Ben, your heart's in the right place."
Leslie Knope,That was unnecessary to add.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Why so many?
Leslie Knope,I've already admitted that I broke your rule.
Leslie Knope,"Jer oh, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Gross!
Leslie Knope,Jerry who?
Leslie Knope,And you think I'm guilty of that?
Leslie Knope,"And yes, it's a filibuster."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you said it yourself: We're 4,000 miles away."
Leslie Knope,"Stupid, ungrateful town."
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, it's how I feel."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry I said ""peepee-heads."""
Leslie Knope,None of those things are true.
Leslie Knope,"And I will prove it, Mr. Traeger."
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much for this amazing award.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is filled with a bunch of peepee-heads.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, we need to counter every charge that Chris has leveled against me."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I need evidence."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm sick of it."
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,You don't know what evidence.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, why are you calling me?"
Leslie Knope,I don't want to waste my international minutes.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Nor will I yield for the rest of the evening.
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not."
Leslie Knope,Why are we here?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Larry."
Leslie Knope,Tell us how this looks.
Leslie Knope,"Bloody hell, Jerry!"
Leslie Knope,Ben wants to do a synchronized couple skate to Losing My Religion.
Leslie Knope,I received adorable nicknames and amazing back rubs.
Leslie Knope,Hit it!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you mean professionally."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, ""everyone""?"
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I thought this bill was tabled?"
Leslie Knope,"I was about to attend a roller skating birthday party for my husband, but this is more important."
Leslie Knope,Point of order!
Leslie Knope,The councilwoman wishes to speak on this issue.
Leslie Knope,"No, I will not yield."
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"No, it wouldn't."
Leslie Knope,That's good news.
Leslie Knope,Is now a good time?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's how I know just how high this conspiracy goes."
Leslie Knope,What can we do about it?
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you asked.
Leslie Knope,The town of Eagleton will be dissolved and re-absorbed into Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,I have some ideas.
Leslie Knope,"After an all-night strategy session, the towns of Pawnee and Eagleton have come up with a potential solution to Eagleton's budget crisis."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, a very smart member of my team pointed out it's the right thing to do."
Leslie Knope,"Or, if I pull it off, I just might win."
Leslie Knope,"He had, and I quote, ""no comment."""
Leslie Knope,How can you not have an extreme reaction about a dress like that?
Leslie Knope,Tell me about your childhood.
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other first.
Leslie Knope,I know how we can help Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,Where's the fire?
Leslie Knope,"And if I throw up on you after I say it, just know that you've been warned."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say something.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,It just doesn't make any sense!
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee will provide some government services, as well as taking on some of Eagleton's debts."
Leslie Knope,I can't understand you.
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I hate Eagletonians as much as you do."
Leslie Knope,Even Larry wants out?
Leslie Knope,What the hell is happening here?
Leslie Knope,All of Pawnee's apples have been recalled-- - g. coli.
Leslie Knope,Does everybody think that running a town is just some game where people can come and go as they please?
Leslie Knope,"- Oh, you don't want them."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think at the end of the day, everybody realizes it's something we have to do."
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's not fair.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to watch the Oscars with Ben alone this year.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll take it."
Leslie Knope,"One at a time, please."
Leslie Knope,"I understand you have concerns and questions, and we are here to listen to them."
Leslie Knope,Just preparing for the grand opening of this tiny but very intrusive park.
Leslie Knope,"And when your neighbor sprains his ankle, you help him off the court."
Leslie Knope,Because they are our neighbor and they've sprained their ankle.
Leslie Knope,They start at midnight.
Leslie Knope,I hate their stupid beautiful faces and their stupid shiny hair.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, don't you remember Angelina Jolie and the leg dress moment?"
Leslie Knope,Who knows when they're gonna end?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't even know the impact of this park, because the city skipped an environmental impact report."
Leslie Knope,So we don't know about traffic problems or sound or lights or crime.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's all a mystery."
Leslie Knope,"I do, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, where you going, Joe?"
Leslie Knope,You've developed some accent from that new town you might move to!
Leslie Knope,Whoa.
Leslie Knope,Ann Your quiet support means the world to me.
Leslie Knope,"Basic boilerplate language, 50 year commitment, blah, blah, blah."
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna help her anymore.
Leslie Knope,Shh
Leslie Knope,You've changed your mind.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, let's go."
Leslie Knope,That is what you tacitly agreed to when you married me.
Leslie Knope,I speak for all of us in all matters.
Leslie Knope,"We all swore that we weren't gonna ever help her again, ever."
Leslie Knope,"But even worse, I'm mad that you just lied to me about it."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am mad that you're doing this."
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad that you're doing this.
Leslie Knope,Wearing Chanel suits?
Leslie Knope,For what?
Leslie Knope,You're in trouble because of your own stupidity.
Leslie Knope,"I don't need any lip from you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,What is she doing here?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What's the big deal?
Leslie Knope,As well as your tacit endorsement of all my behaviors.
Leslie Knope,"As a mature, reasonable adult, I understand that this will be the last project that Ben and I are working on together."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm really surprised you're sitting on this side of the bleachers and not on the Eagleton side with your new girlfriend Ingrid."
Leslie Knope,It's just a little something that I drew up for all the employees of the new town.
Leslie Knope,It seems like no one around here understands the meaning of loyalty.
Leslie Knope,"With all the recall stuff happening, I just really need to feel like you're on my team, and seeing you with them made me feel like you weren't."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry that I blew up at you yesterday.
Leslie Knope,"No, get back over there."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I do a little, yes."
Leslie Knope,I'll find you a bottle or something.
Leslie Knope,There's no way he is in high school.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at this guy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know how it goes."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're 50 points ahead, and they're still dunking."
Leslie Knope,I wish.
Leslie Knope,It only takes one nut job to get people riled up.
Leslie Knope,They are explicitly demanding it.
Leslie Knope,They wouldn't help us if the tables were turned.
Leslie Knope,I am the merger czar.
Leslie Knope,"So if anyone has any questions for me or assistant city manager Ben Wyatt, go right ahead."
Leslie Knope,"The proposed park is very small, but we believe we need to investigate every detail."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for coming to this very important and what I suspect will be lengthy, meeting."
Leslie Knope,"So please join us for the grand opening of Pawnee's Smallest Park on November 12th, 2070."
Leslie Knope,I make the rules.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna teach people the meaning of loyalty in a language they will understand-- complicated legalese.
Leslie Knope,"I hate to say this, but I think we're gonna have to do that environmental impact report."
Leslie Knope,I'm just trying to stop time with legally binding friendship contracts.
Leslie Knope,Way easier to treat.
Leslie Knope,This is a historic day.
Leslie Knope,You're always up in arms about something.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me about what's bothering you.
Leslie Knope,We've been written about in textbooks.
Leslie Knope,And the only know occurrence of Lou Gehrig's other disease.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, this might be a very interesting challenge for you, because Pawnee has the very first documented case of megadiabetes."
Leslie Knope,I once hosted a forum about a new bike rack that lasted seven hours.
Leslie Knope,"Now when I need these people to complain, they're done in 45 minutes?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello."
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this is a surprise."
Leslie Knope,"Look, if Ann wants to leave Pawnee, I get it."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, who wants to stay in the greatest town in the world with her best friend and be happy forever when she can abandon her soul sister like an old shoe and move to a garbage city full of jerks."
Leslie Knope,But the Eagletonians are probably good too.
Leslie Knope,Ron is basically a better version of George Washington.
Leslie Knope,"April, Tom and Donna are three of the best human beings that have ever lived."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure who we should keep.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm trying to save as many jobs as possible, but we're gonna have to lose some people."
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Leslie Knope,No hard feelings.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Mel."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry for the delay, ladies, I was busy being ambushed by treachery."
Leslie Knope,"Anyone Uh, this gentleman wants to say something."
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,"Like, ""I'm leaving Pawnee not!"""
Leslie Knope,"Is this one of those classic Ann ""not"" jokes?"
Leslie Knope,"So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're telling me you're not thinking about leaving Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what were you saying?"
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,I knew she was a monster.
Leslie Knope,Was it Evelyn?
Leslie Knope,Did somebody put you up to this?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I've got a ton of work to do."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,With your tiny little doll feet.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, nobody can fill your shoes, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I feel sorry for her.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"I'm super busy, so you can let yourself"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Ahem.
Leslie Knope,What a story.
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?
Leslie Knope,So did you have a chance to compare notes on your respective duties?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,It's nice to see a friendship blossoming instead of wiling away like a dying turd flower.
Leslie Knope,I should probably talk to him.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take it easy, Alonzo."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,You're the best.
Leslie Knope,"All right, Donna."
Leslie Knope,There's gonna have to be some cutbacks.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, your job is secure, of course."
Leslie Knope,You're basically the glue of this department.
Leslie Knope,I'd like to hear from each and every one of you about a time when prejudice has touched your lives.
Leslie Knope,Can we be doing more?
Leslie Knope,"There are two Eagleton departments Pawnee does not have: the Department of Infinity Pool Design and the Department of Dressage, which I am told is a fancy horseriding thing."
Leslie Knope,But I think Craig's gonna have to go.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Donna, I'm right here."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what are you saying?"
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking about leaving?
Leslie Knope,Intolerance.
Leslie Knope,"Things are exactly the way they were back in 1817, except, you know, women and minorities can vote, we have indoor toilets, and we no longer burn widows for learning arithmetic."
Leslie Knope,"At 12:01 this morning, the city of Eagleton ceased to exist and was reabsorbed back into Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we do, Rose, and you bring up a very good point."
Leslie Knope,That's not good.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,So would you be opposed to signing an official loyalty pledge to our new town?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what I think is crazemazing?"
Leslie Knope,Commitment.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for someone who's in it for the long haul.
Leslie Knope,"We are basically creating a new version of Pawnee, and if Pawnee is gonna commit to one of you, you need to commit to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Tynnyfer, do you have kids?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me a little about yourself."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Jerry Gergich."
Leslie Knope,You only eat vegetables that have been thrown out in people's dumpsters.
Leslie Knope,We brought Jerry out of retirement because we have a mountain of filing to get through.
Leslie Knope,I would like to introduce our new filing temp.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to Pawnee!
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I also have a little surprise."
Leslie Knope,"You do have a counterpart, actually."
Leslie Knope,"And Ron, your guy is also named Ron."
Leslie Knope,"April, you'll be with someone named Tynnyfer."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you'll be with Craig."
Leslie Knope,"Soon, you will be paired up with a person who was roughly your equivalent in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Pawnee Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Eagleton Ron, we here in Pawnee value loyalty above all else."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"The rest of you, welcome to your new departments."
Leslie Knope,"All you horse dancing people, sit in your saddles if you will."
Leslie Knope,"His name is Eric, and I've heard he's amazing."
Leslie Knope,What part of that do you not understand?
Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, let me stare at you while you silently support me on this game plan."
Leslie Knope,Will you just shut your beautiful pie hole?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Knope out.
Leslie Knope,"Unless, of course, you're an Eagletonian, and then you'll be too busy polishing your monocle at the caviar store."
Leslie Knope,I'll see ya at the game.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Eagleton Ron."
Leslie Knope,"But when you tell 'em it's time to change their oil, they ask, ""Extra virgin or white truffle?"""
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not saying that Eagletonians are out of touch."
Leslie Knope,I think it might be time for you to go.
Leslie Knope,"This Ron has the position pretty much locked up, and, uh, I don't think we have any room for you in our department."
Leslie Knope,"What I really want to say is, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you'll excuse me, I need to ascertain the whereabouts of some oversized ceremonial scissors."
Leslie Knope,You're my best friend.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,This whole thing is just scary and confusing.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,"I want to talk about this, all of this, whatever it means."
Leslie Knope,I think it does.
Leslie Knope,That make sense?
Leslie Knope,Was that okay?
Leslie Knope,Well
Leslie Knope,Those are my real friends.
Leslie Knope,I'd pop a Xanax and ask my butler to help me out.
Leslie Knope,"I've got Tynnyfer now, and Craig, and Eric, the racist drug dealer who I've yet to meet."
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and auditing sistah."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Craig!"
Leslie Knope,What does that all mean?
Leslie Knope,And now he doesn't want to work together anymore?
Leslie Knope,The only thing we have left is work.
Leslie Knope,"We have fun, don't we?"
Leslie Knope,"Do you guys remember when this all started and I came in here with the cookies, and then Craig said something so Craig and we all laughed, and we were like, ""Craig!"""
Leslie Knope,I'm just freaking out.
Leslie Knope,Do you think it would be weird if we held hands?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not even attending the ribboncutting ceremony of a park that we made together."
Leslie Knope,Probably.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Ron, I am talking to my best friends."
Leslie Knope,Let me go!
Leslie Knope,"Best friends, attack Ron!"
Leslie Knope,I don't need to explain myself to you! I am the czar.
Leslie Knope,I can do as I please.
Leslie Knope,Those who cross the czar feel the wrath of the czar! Ann is thinking about leaving Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Moving, with Chris."
Leslie Knope,"Nice, Ron? Edible arrangements are nice."
Leslie Knope,"This is volcanically hot betrayal! She is my best friend! She's thinking about leaving, just like that!"
Leslie Knope,"And she wants to ""talk to me"" about it? It's like, I don't even know what to say."
Leslie Knope,I don't even need her.
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I'd do if I was an Eagletonian.
Leslie Knope,"So, I bet somebody feels pretty stupid right now."
Leslie Knope,"I ate one of these for breakfast this morning, and I found a worm in it."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to be a little less intense and a little more considerate.
Leslie Knope,We're just working out the kinks.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Well, almost."
Leslie Knope,"Here, have a seat."
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,But only if you want to.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,It's not important.
Leslie Knope,The only thing that's important is you.
Leslie Knope,Slamming Eagleton is the easiest way to score some points.
Leslie Knope,"I'm losing the recall election, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"I never listened to what you wanted, or how you wanted us to be when things Ended between us."
Leslie Knope,"I just decided what I wanted, and I got upset when you didn't want the same thing."
Leslie Knope,I'm ready to talk about this.
Leslie Knope,"I know that's not fair, and I'm very sorry."
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're on my team.
Leslie Knope,That's the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,I want to talk about this.
Leslie Knope,You don't need to decrease your time with me.
Leslie Knope,I wasn't sure you were gonna come.
Leslie Knope,Am I proud of it?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, these are pesticide free."
Leslie Knope,"If you beat us this year, we will give you a basket of apples from our Pawnee orchard."
Leslie Knope,"As always, we would like to make a friendly wager with Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,And pregnant.
Leslie Knope,While she was in office.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, you are excused, Fake Ann."
Leslie Knope,You need to spend more time with me.
Leslie Knope,That was six hours well spent.
Leslie Knope,I thank you.
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, you need to increase your time with me."
Leslie Knope,She thinks she's so great because she won the Miss Indiana Beauty Pageant.
Leslie Knope,She's a city councilor from Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,That awful human being is Ingrid de Forest.
Leslie Knope,"This year, we get to host the Pawnee Eagleton tipoff classic."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks."
Leslie Knope,Would I do it again?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks."
Leslie Knope,But is it the classiest move?
Leslie Knope,Because Eagleton sucks.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Last year.
Leslie Knope,"If there's a problem with Eagleton, I wanna be there."
Leslie Knope,That's like a dream come true.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I have a new routine I'm working on."
Leslie Knope,"""You blew it."""
Leslie Knope,"""Well, well, well"" Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Leslie Knope,Let's get started with our first slide.
Leslie Knope,You may find it very informative.
Leslie Knope,How about them apples?
Leslie Knope,Do you like apples?
Leslie Knope,Do you like apples?
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Leslie Knope,Let's pretend this box is the basket of apples I bet them on the game.
Leslie Knope,You pretend you're Ingrid.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, guess what I get to do after the game now."
Leslie Knope,Now I get to remind people of that fact as we watch our worst enemy collapse into bankruptcy.
Leslie Knope,I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna hand me the recall election.
Leslie Knope,Now that is the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Leslie Knope,Ahh.
Leslie Knope,What does this mean for them?
Leslie Knope,And take it personally.
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot, so I made unity cookies with the Pawnee town's original colors of blue and yellow."
Leslie Knope,"However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard."
Leslie Knope,But do not worry.
Leslie Knope,"""Super hard."""
Leslie Knope,"""Complete buffoonery."""
Leslie Knope,"""It's hilarious."""
Leslie Knope,"And ""You deserve it."""
Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, please, I beg of you."
Leslie Knope,Fine!
Leslie Knope,I can meet you there.
Leslie Knope,We can go over the poll numbers.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you ready for dinner?"
Leslie Knope,You only have to work here until I'm dead!
Leslie Knope,Is that better?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all Eagleton people meet me in the conference room."
Leslie Knope,"All Pawnee people, sit at your desks."
Leslie Knope,I made enough of them for everybody to wear at the game.
Leslie Knope,"I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out."
Leslie Knope,"Fantastic, right?"
Leslie Knope,"And if you walk out that door, none of us here, and I repeat, none of us will ever help you again."
Leslie Knope,"Your butler made your bed, now you gotta lie in it."
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, blondie."
Leslie Knope,And you need to release a statement that says that Pawnee rules and Eagleton drools.
Leslie Knope,"25% interest, compounded monthly."
Leslie Knope,"We are willing to provide a bridge loan for 50,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,We do have a plan.
Leslie Knope,I'll skip ahead.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like they took it easy on us when they stole all our money and seceded from our town?"
Leslie Knope,Think fast.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I've gained a lot of ground in the polls."
Leslie Knope,Oh my God.
Leslie Knope,Whose fault is this?
Leslie Knope,You're kind of pretty.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're not ""Ann"" pretty, but you have potential."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up, and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year."
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, is it?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess I just need to leave Ben alone."
Leslie Knope,That's what he says he wants.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this steamroller is hanging up her The rolly thing on the front of the machine."
Leslie Knope,What do you what do you call that?
Leslie Knope,"Shut your kind of pretty mouth and, uh, eat a mustard cookie."
Leslie Knope,Probably.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's chitchat, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other and then become familiar best friends.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's so Craig.
Leslie Knope,"If you make your omelet out of Faberge eggs, you just might"
Leslie Knope,"Kind of like a Jeff Foxworthy type thing, but about Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"So, what's your story, new Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you should call me a bulldozer rather than a steamroller."
Leslie Knope,"You are a man of principle and I respect that, cool Ron."
Leslie Knope,I demand to know.
Leslie Knope,Ben thinks that I'm a steamroller?
Leslie Knope,That's unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,How dare he think that I'm a steamroller?
Leslie Knope,"I know, he's going through a phase right now, and eventually we're gonna both be friends again."
Leslie Knope,Mmm!
Leslie Knope,Working too hard.
Leslie Knope,"I know, Ann, you keep starting all these sentences and not finishing"
Leslie Knope,Is that 100 Euros?
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,Everything in my life is going wrong right now.
Leslie Knope,You love Harry Potter.
Leslie Knope,You look beautiful.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,Say cheese.
Leslie Knope,"Because you order white wine, and it gives you a headache."
Leslie Knope,"It really is a pleasure to see you in this context, Ingrid."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know I do this.
Leslie Knope,I'm the worst.
Leslie Knope,Sugar mustard.
Leslie Knope,You've seen all eight movies!
Leslie Knope,Of course I'm upset that I lost the recall election.
Leslie Knope,How how did they get that picture so
Leslie Knope,"Well, we've been at it for hours."
Leslie Knope,I love you so much.
Leslie Knope,This is real.
Leslie Knope,You're my husband.
Leslie Knope,You married me in front of people.
Leslie Knope,"We may have peaked, but it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"We need to do something big, you know, something that really lets people know that we're gonna love each other forever."
Leslie Knope,I got it.
Leslie Knope,"We would like to get tattoos on our bodies, 'cause we love each other."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,It happened!
Leslie Knope,Look what he's doing.
Leslie Knope,He's breaking pens.
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question?
Leslie Knope,Are we the cutest couple you've ever seen?
Leslie Knope,I have a big idea.
Leslie Knope,"I want a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, tastefully done, and then she has a very classy tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm."
Leslie Knope,"Global politics can change, and scenarios can arise and suddenly you're just like, ""wait, I thought this one thing, but look over there."""
Leslie Knope,Let's keep talking.
Leslie Knope,And that's very subtle.
Leslie Knope,"Good, I like what you're saying."
Leslie Knope,"And the people were like, pffft!"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ray."
Leslie Knope,"I wanted to be a city councilor, and I did, and I was, and I was like, whoo!"
Leslie Knope,"I had my time, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"And, Trish, I may not have voted for you, but now is the time for us to come together."
Leslie Knope,"Susan and I will continue on until the women of Pawnee are judged not by the flatness of their tummies, but by the contents of their brains."
Leslie Knope,"This isn't the first time that Susans have lost to Trishes, and it won't be the last."
Leslie Knope,Especially Susan.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just take a moment to give a round of applause to all the contestants this evening?
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Which interview is this?
Leslie Knope,"""Hold up."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, sounds interesting."
Leslie Knope,"""That's a different thing, and it's changing everything,"" and I'm like, ""What?"""
Leslie Knope,And now I'm going to spend the rest of my life really chill.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,There it is.
Leslie Knope,Drink up.
Leslie Knope,Shots!
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"You might want to stop saying ""resigned in disgrace."""
Leslie Knope,Especially during job interviews.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, all I ask is that you look into your hearts, and think, really think, about what you've seen and ask yourselves, ""Who is the most impressive woman here tonight?"""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so, it's still 3- 2 for Trish."
Leslie Knope,I did my thing.
Leslie Knope,"No, scratch that."
Leslie Knope,"What we need to focus on is how to destroy Peru, specifically one person who lives there."
Leslie Knope,Scratch all that.
Leslie Knope,What we are doing is not nuts.
Leslie Knope,"And I don't think we should rush this, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, her name is Trish."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,"No, she didn't-- She didn't answer my question."
Leslie Knope,We are merely getting tattoos so that everybody knows we love each other and that we haven't peaked.
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, world traveler."
Leslie Knope,Don't applaud that.
Leslie Knope,What can we do as citizens to improve on that experiment?
Leslie Knope,"Trish, Alexis de Tocqueville called America ""The Great Experiment."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have a real question, if you don't mind, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Over here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's talk about damage control."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I could go on Pawnee Today, but and I know this is a long shot Oprah has her own network now."
Leslie Knope,"Her values are strong, her commitment to her job is very admirable, she has a real sense ofâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"But in my mind, Susan is the perfect Miss Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"""Sit tight""?"
Leslie Knope,"No, Susan isn't a perfect 10."
Leslie Knope,"""Take a beat""?"
Leslie Knope,She got
Leslie Knope,"Be ""respitable"" for a second, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, relax."
Leslie Knope,Then I got you a tree ornament.
Leslie Knope,"No, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, may I ask, what was your talent?"
Leslie Knope,"Just write ""Ben""."
Leslie Knope,Ann's here!
Leslie Knope,But Trish will win this pageant over my dead body.
Leslie Knope,"I'm a judge, so I don't want to sound partial."
Leslie Knope,Consider yourselves sequestered.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Now, nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it."
Leslie Knope,She'll be someone that little girls in South Central Indiana look up to.
Leslie Knope,"Look, whoever we choose is going to represent the ideal woman for a year."
Leslie Knope,"I hope you honor this crown with dignity, and a devotion to all--"
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hold on, everyone."
Leslie Knope,I think--
Leslie Knope,"Hi, hi, hi, hi."
Leslie Knope,"Well, take Susan, for example."
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,Ann wants a tattoo!
Leslie Knope,I was off getting holiday gifts for my team.
Leslie Knope,"William, here is a Knope 2012 tree ornament."
Leslie Knope,"And Elizabeth, I got you a Knope 2012 Menorah Maybe?"
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,"""Relax""?"
Leslie Knope,Who has tanks for me?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,"Thanks to a lot of hard work and some very dedicated civil servants, this has been a banner year for our city."
Leslie Knope,Why did you have to bring her here?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Leslie Knope,No more distractions.
Leslie Knope,"I want this to be the best founder's week ever, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we need to focus."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the den of horrors.
Leslie Knope,"Scary stuff is invisible, Leah. Broken dreams, disappointment, achieving your greatest goal and having it all fall apart and knowing that you'll never climb any higher."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna give you something sweeter than candy, Ryan. The truth."
Leslie Knope,It's very possible that some of you have already peaked.
Leslie Knope,That's cool.
Leslie Knope,"It's all downhill from here, turkeys."
Leslie Knope,What makes Pawnee so great?
Leslie Knope,I totally understand that.
Leslie Knope,It is Ms. Knope.
Leslie Knope,the only thing I will be waving is your decapitated head on a stick in front of your weeping mother!
Leslie Knope,"I'm just going to, uh, take my flash drive and I'll do some work from home."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, help me out."
Leslie Knope,"It's not city councilwoman Knope, because that chapter of my life is already over."
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, kids, nothing gold can stay."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm not gonna do my job."
Leslie Knope,Obesity and diabetes are down.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna oversee the department, and check in on the parks, and attend any meetings that require the deputy director."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, cry me a river."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why did I ever fight this?
Leslie Knope,I can't get over the Gary/Jerry thing.
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Are you better off now than you were a year ago?
Leslie Knope,I am here today to ask you one question.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, come on, come on."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, this forum is kind of my victory lap."
Leslie Knope,I am very proud of what we've accomplished.
Leslie Knope,"People can now suddenly feel safe in our parks, grocery stores, and hospitals."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee raccoon attacks have decreased.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, concession speech?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I wrote one."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go fall asleep on a bench.
Leslie Knope,"What are you gonna do without tides, Peru?"
Leslie Knope,We got the freaking moon.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Together, we stand and I ask all of you who is ready to join the Coalition of the Willing?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Chris!"
Leslie Knope,Test scores are up.
Leslie Knope,And history will be unkind to those who stand opposed to justice.
Leslie Knope,"That's no problemo, Peru, because Denmark no longer recognizes the authority of this international gang of thugs."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, is that a new jogging shirt?"
Leslie Knope,Do I stutter?
Leslie Knope,"April, what makes Pawnee the best city in the world?"
Leslie Knope,Let's do an exercise.
Leslie Knope,"I'm inventing a new spice called ""salgar."""
Leslie Knope,Accepting that you've peaked is very freeing.
Leslie Knope,"It's part salt, part sugar."
Leslie Knope,"Well, well, well, look who is brave enough to show his face in Europe."
Leslie Knope,"God, it's time for you to nut up, Switzerland."
Leslie Knope,This is war.
Leslie Knope,Butterscotch pudding.
Leslie Knope,Food schmood.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have to go to this meeting with my advisers."
Leslie Knope,Or do you?
Leslie Knope,"Maybe instead of working super hard to rebuild your life, you just said, ""I peaked."""
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What a great run.
Leslie Knope,"Right now, my schedule is just so full."
Leslie Knope,But I'm just busy.
Leslie Knope,"Dave, I like you."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We did.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"You have a big day, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at me, look how busy I am."
Leslie Knope,"Totally, the key is you have to keep yourself busy, or else you're gonna go crazy."
Leslie Knope,"You know, actually, I feel like I can finally relax."
Leslie Knope,I don't feel awful.
Leslie Knope,"I don't wanna overhype it, but our parade makes the rose bowl parade look like a turds on wheels convention."
Leslie Knope,"We've got a pie eating contest, a giant petting zoo, and the granddaddy of them all, the founder's week parade."
Leslie Knope,Founder's week is a yearly celebration of all things Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,"And before we start brainstorming, I just wanna thank Ron for lending us his cabin."
Leslie Knope,You will find information about founder's week.
Leslie Knope,Look in your folders.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Give me the nasal spray.
Leslie Knope,On three.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,One Two Two Three.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"No, they will not be joining us."
Leslie Knope,"You betrayed me, and you went behind my back, and now you need to pay."
Leslie Knope,It's so nice to be able to sit here in public and have breakfast with you.
Leslie Knope,I agree.
Leslie Knope,How about Friday for dinner?
Leslie Knope,"In a way, my suspension from work was kind of a blessing."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'd love to go out with you."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for coming.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I figured.
Leslie Knope,I don't really do any of those things.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, while I was in that meeting, I was also planning my mother's birthday party in my head."
Leslie Knope,She got me good.
Leslie Knope,Three: I am furious that putt-putt has been defunded.
Leslie Knope,"And only because Jamm was going to double-cross you, and I made him stick to his word."
Leslie Knope,"Two: Congratulations, putt-putt has been defunded."
Leslie Knope,One: You drive me nuts with your rigid code of honor.
Leslie Knope,I have six things to say to you.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Great turn out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, welcome everyone to the first meeting of the Parks Committee of Pawnee, or PCP."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Jamm, even for you, this is pretty sleazy."
Leslie Knope,"See, because Yes, because, like the drug PCP, we are so fast acting and powerful, we should be illegal."
Leslie Knope,"Now, what do you want to see fixed in the parks?"
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,"I am, of course, disappointed."
Leslie Knope,"But I am still your City councilwoman for 30 more days, and I intend to spend every second I have left working for you and this great city."
Leslie Knope,You shook Ron's hand and told him that you were gonna vote to close the putt-putt.
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, are you here to rub it in my face that I lost your vote last night?"
Leslie Knope,That is a terrible-- his name is Mr. Fuzzyface!
Leslie Knope,They're not the right principles.
Leslie Knope,Hey! There you guys are.
Leslie Knope,Those principles stink.
Leslie Knope,But you know what?
Leslie Knope,Four: I am sorry that I said the gorilla's blood was on your hands.
Leslie Knope,"You should just stick to your stupid, rigid, antigovernment principles."
Leslie Knope,"The votes have been counted, and I have been recalled."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,And then you either realize that I'm right or you get hungry and go home and I win.
Leslie Knope,"I'll form a citizen action committee, I'll lobby from the outside, I'll harness the power of the community."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I finally have some work to do."
Leslie Knope,People with strong opinions hashing it out respectfully.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I hoped it would be like dealing with you."
Leslie Knope,"But every once in a while, I end up in a situation that makes my stomach queasy."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for dinner, honey."
Leslie Knope,"I have been in the city council for almost a year, and I'm proud of what I've done."
Leslie Knope,Very much.
Leslie Knope,"And six: Your rigid code of honor, which drives me nuts, makes you a wonderful human being, and I am proud to call you my friend, and don't ever change."
Leslie Knope,"""I was voted out of office."""
Leslie Knope,"""In 30 days, I will no longer be a Pawnee city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"Five: Putt-putt is for children, and they are the future, and I have already written a ballot measure that will save it, and it will pass."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's so hard to read when you're drunk."
Leslie Knope,'Twas Leslie killed the beast.
Leslie Knope,"""But I am Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am more than a city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am an unstoppable force of energy."""
Leslie Knope,"""And I will use those days to work as hard as I can."""
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you poetic and noble land mermaid, you're right once again."
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,"Right, I mean, God forbid you're flexible in any way."
Leslie Knope,I would pay any amount of money to properly shame you.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, II know for a fact that nobody in the parks department reads letters, except for one person, who is amazing, but she isn't currently there, because he was suspended."
Leslie Knope,"Check it out, Tom-- the Eagleton reservoir."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it stunning?
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that this water has fluoride in it?
Leslie Knope,Take it and run.
Leslie Knope,Unleash hell!
Leslie Knope,"Scandinavian brothers, on my signal."
Leslie Knope,"Due to a recent betrayal, my homeland, the great state of Denmark, has officially decided to declare war on Peru."
Leslie Knope,This is an urgent world matter.
Leslie Knope,Attention.
Leslie Knope,"Here, kid, want this, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Just excuse me for a
Leslie Knope,"No, you won't."
Leslie Knope,"No, he gets the dragon too?"
Leslie Knope,Damn it!
Leslie Knope,"Don't mess up, don't mess up, don't mess up."
Leslie Knope,Ayn Rand is a terrible writer.
Leslie Knope,That leaves me with only one option.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"First of all, send me a link to that video."
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, now that we have access to the Eagleton reservoir and the water treatment supply, Pawnee is going to have fluoride in its water for the first time in our history, our oral history."
Leslie Knope,"But I have been nothing but straightforward with him, and if anyone in the entire world should understand the difficult position I'm in, it's It's just I've made an effort and I've shared my flags with him, and suddenly, he doesn't want to be friends?"
Leslie Knope,I guess you would know.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I told you to run a button hook.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Reggie!"
Leslie Knope,Irrelevant.
Leslie Knope,"Pretty damn amazing, Diane."
Leslie Knope,Now shush.
Leslie Knope,"If we want to get the government off their bloated, bureaucratic butts, then we need our voices to be heard, and that's what we're gonna do."
Leslie Knope,"Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose."
Leslie Knope,Your office shall serve as its monkey tomb.
Leslie Knope,"It used to bring joy to hundreds of Pawnee families, but then you got rid of its habitat, so it died."
Leslie Knope,I believe you know this gorilla.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, I need some help with the re-zoning thing."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Also, I think we should paint our deck, so I have some color samples for you."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, it was very hard to capture your beauty, and, Ben, you make a sexy pumpkin"
Leslie Knope,No surprise.
Leslie Knope,Love you both.
Leslie Knope,See you later.
Leslie Knope,Everybody on the field!
Leslie Knope,The NFL has a campaign to try to get kids active for 60 minutes per day.
Leslie Knope,"And so we bused in a hundred lucky, little buggers from Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Run!
Leslie Knope,And they are gonna get a chance to play with the Colts.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"And to thank you both for being there when I needed you, I carved your faces into these Jack-o-lanterns."
Leslie Knope,I'm taking that gorilla with me and putting it back in the putt-putt - when it reopens.
Leslie Knope,"God, you're the worst."
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we could just, you know"
Leslie Knope,"Good, a couple days are free."
Leslie Knope,The first female Secretary of State.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's Madeleine Albright."
Leslie Knope,That's Madeleine Albright.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Let's see.
Leslie Knope,Let me check my schedule.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah, sure."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"But you know, they had to change it for obvious reasons."
Leslie Knope,"The original title of this was ""A Lively Fisting."""
Leslie Knope,"This depicts kind of a famous fight between Reverend Bradley and Anna Beth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven."
Leslie Knope,"You know, in the 1880s, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, this one's a beauty."
Leslie Knope,What you doing in these parts?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,You want to hear something awful?
Leslie Knope,He didn't even know who Madeleine Albright was.
Leslie Knope,"Not you, too."
Leslie Knope,Strawberry margaritas!
Leslie Knope,Another use for salgar!
Leslie Knope,She got me.
Leslie Knope,She's not even twirling the baton.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, they can't all be winners."
Leslie Knope,She's good.
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,"And I'm sure between the five of us, we will choose the most well-rounded, intelligent, modern and forward thinking woman to represent our fine town."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom and I are very happy to be here."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,How do you do?
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,He's also gonna be a judge.
Leslie Knope,"I am Judge Leslie Knope and this is my colleague, Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow judges."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, could you date someone who doesn't love giving vaccinations?"
Leslie Knope,I just don't know if I can date someone who doesn't share my interests.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,That cop that I met.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Dave."
Leslie Knope,"Madeleine Albright, the first female Secretary of State."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course, Ray."
Leslie Knope,Uhoh.
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Are you gonna take it?
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you're definitely getting some."
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, I think you might be getting some daffodils, too."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because I ordered a beautiful bouquet of daffodils, from a website, after a few glasses of wine."
Leslie Knope,"So everybody needs to pitch in, like, 90 dollars."
Leslie Knope,You know what I think?
Leslie Knope,So I got him flowers from all of us.
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,"- What? No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,"Intellectually, I knew that I might be in trouble, but deep in my heart, I never really thought"
Leslie Knope,"""They held the recall election, and I lost."""
Leslie Knope,"As we all know, Ron is recovering from his hernia surgery."
Leslie Knope,"If you don't love it, take a month."
Leslie Knope,See what else is out there.
Leslie Knope,Time will tell.
Leslie Knope,Anything.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me about something.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need you to distract me."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,You and I are like family.
Leslie Knope,"April, it's unethical for me to show you favoritism."
Leslie Knope,Ben!
Leslie Knope,I'm going crazy!
Leslie Knope,"First, they won't let me work in the parks department, now they won't let me campaign either."
Leslie Knope,"So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy."
Leslie Knope,"You know, that is why I decided to become a judge."
Leslie Knope,That's wonderful.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"And as a judge, let me assure you that this year's Miss Pawnee will be chosen for her talent and poise."
Leslie Knope,"April, whoever Miss Pawnee is, is gonna be the representative of womanhood in our town."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously."
Leslie Knope,"All I want to do is improve our town, and they won't let me do that!"
Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm leaving early tonight because I am a judge in the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."
Leslie Knope,This is just sugar.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, April."
Leslie Knope,She had more funding.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna call you Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,"George, I notice that you're wearing glasses, yet on the day in question, I don't recall you wearing glasses."
Leslie Knope,Could it be because you weren't wearing glasses?
Leslie Knope,Why is there no rice in this municipal government building?
Leslie Knope,"Can you take your glasses off, please, and read this for us?"
Leslie Knope,"Rice, I need to find some rice, I need to throw some rice."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that went terribly."
Leslie Knope,"As Ronald Reagan would say, ""Well, mommy, I believe voting rights are important."""
Leslie Knope,I need to check some facts and figures.
Leslie Knope,I would like to request a 55 day recess.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you hold this colorful bouquet of highlighters?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, my only hope is that in one of these old books, there's some weird, arcane statute or government rule that helps me."
Leslie Knope,"So everybody grab a volume, and let's just read up."
Leslie Knope,I need to get some flowers.
Leslie Knope,Does anyone have anything?
Leslie Knope,Did anybody find anything good?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is like a waking nightmare of happiness."
Leslie Knope,"Diane, you have no idea what that means to me."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know we're not supposed to be seen together, but I think Ben could be really helpful with this."
Leslie Knope,Please do that.
Leslie Knope,Does anyone else think it's hot in here?
Leslie Knope,What do we do with those kids? We totally ruined their club.
Leslie Knope,Can somebody go get him?
Leslie Knope,"Let's pump the brakes, Carl, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, it's happening!"
Leslie Knope,"Ben, how are we gonna get Kathy Ireland to do naked aerobics for them?"
Leslie Knope,What you saw was not what you think it is.
Leslie Knope,"I have a gift certificate, actually, for you."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the strike is worth it if I can take these off."
Leslie Knope,"The clue ""Who's the worst,"" but you know what?"
Leslie Knope,And thank you for your discretion.
Leslie Knope,"Last week, I was an answer in the Pawnee Journal's Crossword Puzzle."
Leslie Knope,The people who want to boot me from office have been viciously attacking me for weeks.
Leslie Knope,That was beautiful.
Leslie Knope,Pretend this is rice!
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Hooray!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,It's ugh!
Leslie Knope,"At first glance, it may seem as though Ron Swanson and I have nothing in common, but Webster's dictionary defines ""friend"""
Leslie Knope,"I would just like to give a short speech, if I may."
Leslie Knope,"Before you Carl, just one second."
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,She said yes!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, it's going to start!"
Leslie Knope,"If you would just slow down a little, then I could arrange balloons or a flower cake or a bouncy castle"
Leslie Knope,These overalls are really starchy.
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Second wind!
Leslie Knope,"We stand on the side of Rosa Parks, and Gandhi, and Team Aniston."
Leslie Knope,"Well, catch you later."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I know I let you down.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,One small vote for Pawnee is one giant leap of voting for mankind.
Leslie Knope,"If I save your right to vote, you're gonna vote for someone from Eagleton?"
Leslie Knope,Okeydokey.
Leslie Knope,And I just want to say I'm really sorry.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing I love more than squeegeeing slime off a highway underpass.
Leslie Knope,We're coming back from cleaning up the Pawnee River.
Leslie Knope,"Well, hello there."
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna yield.
Leslie Knope,I justâ¦ I need some time to think.
Leslie Knope,"And because I must keep talking, I'm gonna think out loud."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, if Eagletonians vote for someone else, then it would be in my best interest to stop, right?"
Leslie Knope,So they can't vote.
Leslie Knope,Do your thing.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, everybody stop reading no more loopholes, no more fighting."
Leslie Knope,I'm a bad person.
Leslie Knope,And I believe that half of that statement is still true today.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I propose a treaty that states that we have a fun conversation once a day at work for five minutes."
Leslie Knope,"Well, speaking of heat, we should discuss America's whitehot passion for voting rights and the men and women who help protect them, like the local city councilwoman who is starving and thinking about her husband's Reservoir Dog themed birthday cake and wanting to eat it really badly."
Leslie Knope,"Ron is getting married, and I love him, and I care about him, and this is the greatest day ever, and I do not have time to talk about this!"
Leslie Knope,I justI'm having so many thoughts and feelings that I'm paralyzed right now.
Leslie Knope,"No, he said he'd just be on the other side of that wall."
Leslie Knope,He's probably in the bathroom.
Leslie Knope,Democracy is not unlike a cake.
Leslie Knope,Wha What who's what the
Leslie Knope,You're too important to me.
Leslie Knope,I just need you to be in my life.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"It's layered, delicious, chocolate, and I want some."
Leslie Knope,Thank you!
Leslie Knope,You are all warriors of democracy.
Leslie Knope,"This mural is called Bad Pawnee, Good Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"You know, it was the first mayor of Pawnee, in 1817, who said, ""All we have is the right to vote and the right to kill Indians without consequence."""
Leslie Knope,All the terrible things that have happened in this town's history are on one side.
Leslie Knope,And on the other side are all the good things that have happened.
Leslie Knope,I'm on the bad side.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I'm guilty.
Leslie Knope,I did something bad.
Leslie Knope,"It's bad enough that we can't be together, but the thought of us not being friends is Is just too crappy for me to handle."
Leslie Knope,That would defeat the purpose.
Leslie Knope,Is the gong really necessary?
Leslie Knope,We're fighting back.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Janet Napoli freaking tano?
Leslie Knope,That's important.
Leslie Knope,"But other than that, I think I'm winning."
Leslie Knope,Those kids are passionate about something.
Leslie Knope,I've refuted every one of Chris' claims so far.
Leslie Knope,How long have I been talking?
Leslie Knope,Three hours?
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Leslie Knope,Not here.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, will you please describe what we were wearing the evening you saw us?"
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, eight minutes."
Leslie Knope,Or taking some small countries.
Leslie Knope,And we will just be not here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"In this room, and you're gonna run the show."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks to a coordinated effort between the parks department and the city manager's office, three months from now, we are gonna hold a State-wide Model U.N."
Leslie Knope,"And when you walked into the room, what did it look like?"
Leslie Knope,Did it look like anything romantic had happened?
Leslie Knope,This is amazing and perfect.
Leslie Knope,It was an amazing phase.
Leslie Knope,"This is exactly the kind of big, splashy thing that's gonna get the voters' attention."
Leslie Knope,London?
Leslie Knope,And I did have some problem with my character witnesses.
Leslie Knope,"Politics, right?"
Leslie Knope,What now?
Leslie Knope,What are you gonna do?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,One little news blast wouldn't hurt.
Leslie Knope,I want to know what's happening there.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this trip is amazing, but I miss Pawnee, you know?"
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"""So I long for a day when women in government will simply be seen as people in government, but until then, I will work to make Pawnee, my wonderful hometown, as good as it can be."""
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your pick."
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,"The Notting Hill bus tour starts at 2:00, the Love Actually bus tour starts at 2:30, andoh, the Bridget Jones bus tour starts at 2:30 also."
Leslie Knope,Good luck.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right, as usual."
Leslie Knope,It's like leaving my kid at home without a babysitter.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel bad about leaving Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Andy and Ben are gonna go to their meeting, and then we're gonna go back to the hotel for lunch, and I will spend the day getting to know London's history."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, we are going to be sightseeing today."
Leslie Knope,"We're going to London, you guys!"
Leslie Knope,We're going to London?
Leslie Knope,When is the ceremony?
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was an office.
Leslie Knope,9301 Cedarcrest Drive
Leslie Knope,This person to person campaigning is kind of wearing me down.
Leslie Knope,Who's here?
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"And you have every right to be, but we're hoping what we're gonna show you right now will make up for that."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Tammy two is your killer witness?
Leslie Knope,Please!
Leslie Knope,"You're gonna have to do better Actually, she is a terrifying sociopath who could say or do anything A pretty good killer witness."
Leslie Knope,"As I dissect this important and profound statement, I'm just gonna take these off for a second."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have about 30 more people who want to come into my office and complain to my face."
Leslie Knope,I think I've proven that the only rule Ben and I broke was dating each other.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're on it, because ""No problem too small."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Gretel, how can I help you today?"
Leslie Knope,George Williams?
Leslie Knope,"Who's Oh, George Williams He's just a maintenance worker, NASCAR enthusiast, I believe."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, France, bienvenue."
Leslie Knope,"And, oh, interesting tidbit I once bribed him to keep my relationship with Ben quiet."
Leslie Knope,"Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small."
Leslie Knope,"We are currently in phase 26: ""No problem too small."""
Leslie Knope,I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.
Leslie Knope,Do you own a cabin
Leslie Knope,This is very important.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, don't be ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,Can you confirm that you own a cabin at 930
Leslie Knope,"City Hall was being fumigated, and we need to pull an allnighter."
Leslie Knope,"Which, for the record, Denmark would have won, but that's neither here nor there."
Leslie Knope,The only thing that was ravaged were these federal grant proposals that Donna had dropped off earlier.
Leslie Knope,Everyone in Pawnee should have the right to vote.
Leslie Knope,"I've seen over 200 episodes of Law & Order, and it's paying off bigtime."
Leslie Knope,"And by the way, we got the gramps grants."
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It was gonna be such an awesome moment.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ethel, you've been to a million of these ethics trials."
Leslie Knope,Right
Leslie Knope,Sit down.
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers."
Leslie Knope,The nicest room in City Hall by a factor of like a million.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think ""No problem too small"" is working."
Leslie Knope,Is it ethical for a court stenographer to bet on the outcome of a hearing?
Leslie Knope,I have to come up with some solution for this slug problem.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee City Council chambers.
Leslie Knope,Let's press on.
Leslie Knope,"Good memory, sunfish."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, there has been a question posed about when my relationship with Ben Wyatt ended."
Leslie Knope,What do you think my chances are?
Leslie Knope,"I think I'm about to get fired, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no, don't."
Leslie Knope,I have no objections.
Leslie Knope,Who cares about the recall?
Leslie Knope,It's Kevin's day.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, people, the grand opening is in 20 hours."
Leslie Knope,"Larry, you had the easiest job, Two triangles and a tooth."
Leslie Knope,Nobody wants Gengurch family themed Jackolanterns.
Leslie Knope,Can't wait to graduate.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's no, it's"
Leslie Knope,"If you are referring to my fight to teach comprehensive sex education, you need to at least acknowledge the fact that STDs are down 14% from last year."
Leslie Knope,Is any of this even good?
Leslie Knope,"Why didn't we call it ""City Halloween""?"
Leslie Knope,I hate it here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need to change every single banner."
Leslie Knope,Fun!
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about that right now.
Leslie Knope,There was a piece of testimony that came out during the trial that I think you'd be interested in.
Leslie Knope,"Ethel? Ethel, could you please read page 132 of the official testimony?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're a genius!"
Leslie Knope,Your brain is almost as perfect as your face.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, great work, as always."
Leslie Knope,He's being a jerk.
Leslie Knope,That's something to focus on today.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, um... It's Kevin Pollack's birthday."
Leslie Knope,That's true.
Leslie Knope,No discussion about the recall election until the polls close at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,Let's focus on what we can control.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"Chris, could you just please"
Leslie Knope,"In 24 hours, we are going to transform City Hall into the best haunted house Pawnee has ever seen."
Leslie Knope,It's recall day.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's not like I'm some kind of sex crazed maniac or something.
Leslie Knope,"No, what happened was there was a misunderstanding, and I accidentally got the government involved in an unseemly business, but I cleared that up, and everything's fine."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, honey, how was your day?"
Leslie Knope,"Gah, gah, gah, gah"
Leslie Knope,"I've made my case, and the latest polls have it as a dead heat, so there's nothing left to do but wait."
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I got stuff to do."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, Brandi."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it used to be a quaint, little movie rental place with a lot of community value."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe you did that for me.
Leslie Knope,No need for further questions on that one.
Leslie Knope,I'm planning a haunted house.
Leslie Knope,"There you go, perfect example."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna stay here and just kind of wait for the results to pour in.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you all tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, fartwads?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich? Jerry Gergich.
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've been boycotting them ever since Pinewood and her goons started this whole recall business, but who cares now, right?"
Leslie Knope,Jerry Gergich.
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry God, they're both horrible."
Leslie Knope,But Jerry's better.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I see them."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"And frankly, I don't see any of those citizens standing up and complaining about"
Leslie Knope,I simply stopped a restaurant from serving an insane which only made our citizens healthier.
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, I've never stripped away anyone's freedoms."
Leslie Knope,What does it matter?
Leslie Knope,Nothing matters anymore.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is good.
Leslie Knope,This is really good.
Leslie Knope,"So the Coalition of the Willing is Denmark, Botswana, and the Moon."
Leslie Knope,"Now, here's what we're gonna do."
Leslie Knope,Your name is Jerry.
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"No, really, it's gonna be hours before they call it."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, that's very sweet, you guys."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's hunker down."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a long night.
Leslie Knope,What did he say?
Leslie Knope,Madame Ambassadeur Pourquoi?
Leslie Knope,"While he does that, we are gonna make sure--"
Leslie Knope,Ben is probably shoring up his support in South America.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's because they're all standing up saying how much they hate me as a person.
Leslie Knope,Parades and your butt: My two vices.
Leslie Knope,This feels strangely personal.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Dewey."
Leslie Knope,You somehow convinced the school board that napkins are a vegetable.
Leslie Knope,Those school lunches are incredibly unhealthy.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ethel."
Leslie Knope,Can you please state your name for the committee?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,You can't even get your own name right.
Leslie Knope,And people checking into the E.R. after ingesting a whole candy wrapper is down 40%.
Leslie Knope,Gary?
Leslie Knope,"A gym opened, and it stayed in business."
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a horrible price to pay for something as trivial as gender equality.
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect thing to take my mind off of yesterday.
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?
Leslie Knope,"Larry, everyone else was able to make it to the committee meeting on time."
Leslie Knope,What? Wait.
Leslie Knope,"So, in conclusion, recall, shmecall."
Leslie Knope,That's--
Leslie Knope,All I want is the promise of democracy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wasn't asking you specifically, but I'm happy to hear that, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,I want that marg.
Leslie Knope,"Again, all I really care about is are you better off?"
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,I want that Margarita.
Leslie Knope,I want to drink it.
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,Give me that Margarita!
Leslie Knope,"Silver Linings Playbook, kind of."
Leslie Knope,No! I want votes.
Leslie Knope,You Got Served.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, in these last few minutes, I would like to talk about the voting rights act of 1968 while clenching every muscle in my body."
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Leslie Knope,"I love you, but move! I have to go to the whiz palace."
Leslie Knope,Go crazy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait!"
Leslie Knope,You can't let him resign.
Leslie Knope,"No, I can't end my big press conference by saying ""Recall, shmecall."""
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, can you help me out here?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, honey."
Leslie Knope,Just remember to use protection.
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy for you.
Leslie Knope,Just two weeks?
Leslie Knope,"Or I keep going, because the right to vote is fundamental in any democracy, and this is bigger than me or anyone."
Leslie Knope,I don't care if I lose.
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how's it going with you guys?"
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris."
Leslie Knope,I thought I was gonna get fired.
Leslie Knope,"If you disagree with me, then go ahead and recall me."
Leslie Knope,I should've gotten fired.
Leslie Knope,"Volunteer weekend task force, mobilize."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee river's not gonna clean itself.
Leslie Knope,"Alright, people."
Leslie Knope,No one prevents people in my town from voting.
Leslie Knope,That's another dance movie with Jessica alba.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,The filibuster is on!
Leslie Knope,Honey.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, it's so hot."
Leslie Knope,Almost as hot as the flames that Eagleton would have gone down in if I had not saved them.
Leslie Knope,Why didn't I get fired?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, do you remember a time"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! That was epic! I was peeing so freakin' hard, it was like a jacuzzi jet or--"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I work very hard for this town, as hard as I can, and all that matters to me is whether or not everyone here thinks that they are better off now than they were a year ago."
Leslie Knope,I am an extremely fun person.
Leslie Knope,But I am not trying to stop you from having fun.
Leslie Knope,Certain people are lashing out at me because of things that I did this year.
Leslie Knope,I don't think this is very fair!
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to stop your parade or anything, but I just have to say something here, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Stop!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, stop, please!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"No, it's me, and damn them."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,Is that me?
Leslie Knope,It's wonderful.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry your birthday party got all screwed up.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Chris."
Leslie Knope,Kernston's Rubber Nipple Company elects a nipple king and a nipple queen every year to ride on the float.
Leslie Knope,I am going to pretend that this is my victory parade and the town is celebrating my hard work and dedication.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should put those roller skates back on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we're not going to the party."
Leslie Knope,We're going home.
Leslie Knope,I've never felt this way before.
Leslie Knope,"A rain check, maybe."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that is the best offer you could ever make, but I had to miss my husband's birthday party for this, so I think I'll be spending the evening with him."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just quit.
Leslie Knope,Hey! Ingrid! I wasn't talking about the velocity of my pee because you are a very smart and classy lady.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you remember Ingrid de Forest from the former Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,There's one.
Leslie Knope,Stomp the Yard.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, my adrenaline is pumping, so all I can think of is dance movie titles."
Leslie Knope,Step Up 2: The Streets.
Leslie Knope,Step up.
Leslie Knope,My response to them is this: Bring it on.
Leslie Knope,"As most of you probably know, there is a large committee that has announced plans to recall me from office."
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming.
Leslie Knope,I think you are.
Leslie Knope,"But even if I wanted to fight this recall, how would I do it?"
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, I do."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Like, I'm not going to watch that live?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was Elizabeth Warren."
Leslie Knope,Buzz kill.
Leslie Knope,I hope that's true.
Leslie Knope,"Right, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should both quit, and we should move to the Bahamas, live on a beach, catch fish with homemade spears."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"The store will serve a wider range of Pawnee's citizens, and a Pawnee cultural institution will be saved."
Leslie Knope,We have followed protocol to the letter.
Leslie Knope,I have given specific instructions to the Pawnee Videodome about how they are going to spend their money.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that misleading?
Leslie Knope,"The name implies that there are zero calories, like most water, but in fact, it has 300 calories per serving."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about water zero.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ms. Pinewood, but why would anybody need this much soda?"
Leslie Knope,"""How is this a ""childsize soda""?"
Leslie Knope,"Then, there is a horrifying 512 ounce version that they call ""child size."""
Leslie Knope,"Aw, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"Most people call it a gallon, but they call it the ""regular."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh, Paunch Burger just recently came out with a new 128ounce option."
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, recently, many of the local restaurants have changed their ""small size"" option to a whopping 64ounces."
Leslie Knope,How can I ever repay you?
Leslie Knope,He's really smart.
Leslie Knope,You've always supported me.
Leslie Knope,"I know you hate feelings and emotions, but I would not be where I am if it wasn't for you."
Leslie Knope,There's something I need to say to you.
Leslie Knope,"Our political differences aside, I am about to go to my first committee meeting as a city councilwoman."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm really glad that you're here."
Leslie Knope,"I believe, with my help, all local restaurants can get healthier Paunch Burger, Big and Wide, The Fat Sack, Coronel Plum's Slop Trough which was formerly Sue's Salads until we ran that out of town."
Leslie Knope,My first act as a city councilwoman I've proposed a tax on all those giant sugary sodas so we can discourage people from drinking them.
Leslie Knope,It's so good.
Leslie Knope,What did you put in the sugar?
Leslie Knope,What a powerful image.
Leslie Knope,All that sugar?
Leslie Knope,That is gross.
Leslie Knope,You hired me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so do you have the results of the study?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think we're done here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,This is very confusing.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope,Half and half.
Leslie Knope,"So, about half?"
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,Hold up green if you agree and red if you disagree.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, um, let's take a quick straw poll."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, no, actually, it is."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, you don't pay your income tax?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, anyone else?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"Grover, give that woman her purse back."
Leslie Knope,"Well, sir, I may vote against the tax, because, frankly, I don't take job losses lightly."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,"I proposed this bill, but the issue has become very complicated, so before I decide how I am going to vote, I'd love to hear from both sides."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,I need some sugar.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope Soda Tax Forces Massive Layoffs."""
Leslie Knope,Are you bluffing?
Leslie Knope,She's bluffing.
Leslie Knope,You're bluffing.
Leslie Knope,Ben's doing an amazing job as campaign manager.
Leslie Knope,"Well, ma'am, my original stance was that implementing this tax would be good for public health."
Leslie Knope,So do you.
Leslie Knope,But it would be so cute!
Leslie Knope,"So, how is San Diego"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no! What did I do?"
Leslie Knope,"I apologize for having fun, and for making something cute!"
Leslie Knope,"Last time I checked, I don't think I murdered anyone, or had an affair, or did drugs! But I apologize."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me, because it's not gonna happen, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,And I'm not gonna annul it.
Leslie Knope,"That penguin wedding was cute, damn it."
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"Attendance is up 30% at the zoo, by the way."
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Next caller.
Leslie Knope,I will not be annulling.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Next caller.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,So you're leaving tomorrow?
Leslie Knope,Hey! You're on the air!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it was so good to see you."
Leslie Knope,How does this work?
Leslie Knope,Bring it on.
Leslie Knope,"How's that, now?"
Leslie Knope,Let's go for it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, two for resign."
Leslie Knope,They might die.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,They're just in their own little penguin love bubble.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look! Six Flags! I should take them on a water slide."
Leslie Knope,At least they'll be together.
Leslie Knope,What did you just say?
Leslie Knope,Did you just say you were still in love with me?
Leslie Knope,"Gay marriage is legal there, so hopefully, they'll be happy."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, why would you tell me that here and now?"
Leslie Knope,"So, I transferred the penguins to a zoo in lowa."
Leslie Knope,"No, you cannot bring this up at all when my boyfriend is here."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I already called him and told him that you were dying to go out with him, so have fun."
Leslie Knope,Good! Great.
Leslie Knope,"No, bad call."
Leslie Knope,That's not the call.
Leslie Knope,Look at them.
Leslie Knope,"No, listen to me."
Leslie Knope,"But don't not do it because of me, because I'm really fine with it."
Leslie Knope,"If you don't want to go out with him, don't go out with him."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"I thought about it, and, look, he might not be my gay penguin, but he could be yours."
Leslie Knope,"Really, seriously."
Leslie Knope,I think you should go on that date with Mark.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We don't know anything about love.
Leslie Knope,We're just animals.
Leslie Knope,You know what I realized?
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,I guess that's what it's like when you meet your mate and know you're gonna be together forever.
Leslie Knope,All that's important to me is that we're still friends.
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.
Leslie Knope,You always look beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I couldn't sleep a wink last night, so at 5:00 in the morning, I went to Paunch Burger for a pickmeup."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,Its only door is in my office.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing in my bathroom?
Leslie Knope,Councilman Jamm.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God.
Leslie Knope,I have my own private bathroom.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is the coolest part ever."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee and Washington D.C.
Leslie Knope,Here are my clocks.
Leslie Knope,I am big enough to admit that I am often inspired by myself.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,No deal.
Leslie Knope,Here is my wall of inspirational women.
Leslie Knope,"I love it, too."
Leslie Knope,"I know, do you like it?"
Leslie Knope,I'm in my new city council office.
Leslie Knope,Where are you?
Leslie Knope,I miss you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,Stranger things have happened.
Leslie Knope,"And who knows, maybe in the future, my enemies will become my friends."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I may have made some enemies today, but that is part of the job."
Leslie Knope,"And by the way, she's totally bluffing about laying people off, you watch."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'm very pleased with my vote because I voted my conscience."
Leslie Knope,Strongly in favor.
Leslie Knope,Check this out.
Leslie Knope,Aye.
Leslie Knope,And we're walking.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,Do you ever give a perm to someone and ever regret it?
Leslie Knope,"Are you excited, Autumn?"
Leslie Knope,I could not be more excited about this.
Leslie Knope,I have wanted this perm since middle school.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee's police chief is retiring, and I'm trying to get his endorsement before he goes."
Leslie Knope,I'm really nervous because I need this for my campaign.
Leslie Knope,And Ben is really nervous because he is afraid of cops.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the city council meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody leave."
Leslie Knope,"I understand you need to think about it, but if you were going to make a decision"
Leslie Knope,I'm not weird.
Leslie Knope,"I'm doing a porpoise call, which we used to do when I was part of your group, but it seems like you don't do it any more and that's fine."
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Porpoise call!
Leslie Knope,"Wrong, your greatest accomplishment is happening in two hours when this bill becomes law."
Leslie Knope,What is your greatest accomplishment?
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Pawnee Porpoises youth swim team, I have a question for you."
Leslie Knope,Don't.
Leslie Knope,"By passing the bill, and extending pool hours, we are saying to our citizens that this City Council is determined to better our town."
Leslie Knope,I'm a city councilor with porpoise.
Leslie Knope,Because not only am I a city councilor.
Leslie Knope,"Recently, the Captain of the Pawnee Porpoises swim team asked me if we could keep the public pools open longer so they could log more practice time, and I said, ""Absolutely."""
Leslie Knope,"The city council has some political gridlock and some partisan bickering, but we're actually about to pass a bill my bill the Leslie Knope Fun In The Sun Act, which will extend public pool hours citywide."
Leslie Knope,That's the definition of an opinion.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's your opinion."
Leslie Knope,"I just want you to be very proud of yourselves, because this bill is going to start a long romance between the city and its government."
Leslie Knope,"And, listen, as far as this firing stuff goes, I won't forget and I will never forgive you."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Are you gonna pull out some embarrassing photo of me from high school?
Leslie Knope,Now everything is different.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, when I used to just work here, I was always so sure of myself."
Leslie Knope,"Everything's upside down, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm a mess."
Leslie Knope,"No, look, he's here for one night."
Leslie Knope,Can we take a recess?
Leslie Knope,"He's a really great guy, and he's gonna love you, which bonus will make all the other cops love you."
Leslie Knope,"Dave is a great person, and he's a great judge of character."
Leslie Knope,"Mayhaps, might I suggest that we have a aah!"
Leslie Knope,"Gentlemen, it appears that I have fallen ill."
Leslie Knope,"Tonight he's going to endorse Ben, and Trumple is going to endorse me."
Leslie Knope,Double endorsement.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, that sounds like an Ashley Judd movie."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna have to wait, and when they call my name, I'll do what my gut tells me to do."
Leslie Knope,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Leslie Knope,I'm lost.
Leslie Knope,I've lost all of my instincts.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I'm under a warm waterfall of uncertainty.
Leslie Knope,It's like I'm floating in this giant river of ambiguity.
Leslie Knope,"If I vote for the tax, then I might lose my job, and if I vote against it, I might be betraying my own bill."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,You know what it tastes like?
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't decide what kind of soda I wanted, so I had them put all six in one cup."
Leslie Knope,Uhh!
Leslie Knope,I shouldn't have invited him.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,You should come to dinner with us.
Leslie Knope,I just feel like I've lost my bearings.
Leslie Knope,You could not keep it together in there.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I had conviction because I knew what I believed in, but I know with this new job."
Leslie Knope,I was a dedicated public servant.
Leslie Knope,Why did you try to get me fired?
Leslie Knope,I don't understand.
Leslie Knope,What you me four four fired times?
Leslie Knope,"""Request for termination""? You tried to fire me once?"
Leslie Knope,"""Above and beyond."""
Leslie Knope,Dave.
Leslie Knope,"""Commendation."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"""Brilliant work."""
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Be serious.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, the people at the public forum said they might want to fire me."
Leslie Knope,You look great.
Leslie Knope,"I need to go back to those chambers in 20 minutes, and I have to cast a vote, and I don't know what I'm gonna do."
Leslie Knope,I'm in big trouble.
Leslie Knope,"I need you, Ron, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"O Captain, my Captain."
Leslie Knope,"So what are you oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, my rock, my steady, guiding light."
Leslie Knope,"Um, Ben, this, uh this is my this is Dave Sanderson."
Leslie Knope,Are you here for a while?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, we're going to that, too, actually, but we're gonna go a little later, because first, we're going to have dinner at a really nice new French restaurant."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I have one night of fun with some of the best dancers I've ever danced with, and suddenly everybody's freaking out?"
Leslie Knope,"Because, I bust my ass for the people in this city, and I can't win."
Leslie Knope,You don't have to.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"So, if you move here, I hope we can be friends, but I love Ben."
Leslie Knope,"He comes first, and if you're going to act like an ass, I can't talk to you, ever."
Leslie Knope,Hmmâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look, they sent us a Tshirt."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Shrimpy or not He's smart, and he's cute, and he's kind, and he's funny, and he's got a great face and nice hair, and he's"
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, so the point is, do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement?"
Leslie Knope,Effeminate.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, sorry, what's the situation?"
Leslie Knope,I'm very happy.
Leslie Knope,"A few weeks ago, a guy called me a bitch in a bowling alley, and he punched him in the face."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're wearing a peach shirt with a coiled snake on it."
Leslie Knope,But you're effeminate.
Leslie Knope,I know that you are not gay.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, whatever."
Leslie Knope,Step into my office.
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, nobody eat that cake."
Leslie Knope,They thought that was a political gesture?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, the nights I've wasted there."
Leslie Knope,The Bulge is a gay bar?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has a gay bar?
Leslie Knope,And he's not shrimpy.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, a garbage man was suspended for wearing a Live Strong bracelet."
Leslie Knope,How does this work?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're serious?"
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"He was a very important person to me, and it mattered to me that he liked you, which is silly."
Leslie Knope,Let's just go home.
Leslie Knope,"Well, what can I do for you and those fine people at the SFSF?"
Leslie Knope,"No, let's not go there."
Leslie Knope,"I don't care about the endorsement, and I don't want to put you through this any more."
Leslie Knope,I love your top.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello."
Leslie Knope,That was hands down the best interaction I've ever had with Donna.
Leslie Knope,I guess they think I'm fabulous or something.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm the guest of honor at this gay bar tonight.
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Who made this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,"I'm a public servant, and I'm not allowed to take a political stance."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, April, please, it was just penguins."
Leslie Knope,So what can I do for you guys?
Leslie Knope,"The thing about youth culture is, I don't understand it."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,I guess gay men are starting to like me.
Leslie Knope,People in this town don't really like their government employees being activists.
Leslie Knope,Uh-uh.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"So, what's up?"
Leslie Knope,Just a little something I know.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I made a mistake But parents are the same No matter time nor place So to all you kids all across the land No need to argue Parents just don't understand Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Sunroof was open, the music was high And that girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car I can't believe it!"
Leslie Knope,"Of course I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot Pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girly girl walking I picked up my car phone To perpetrate like I was talking"
Leslie Knope,"I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, of course not."
Leslie Knope,Would they mind?
Leslie Knope,They left the keys to the brand new Porsche.
Leslie Knope,Your parents went away on a week's vacation.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Spin it around and back it on up.
Leslie Knope,"I meant the Jefferson Memorial, you perv."
Leslie Knope,There's only one sight I want to see right now.
Leslie Knope,"But we can do this, right?"
Leslie Knope,It does.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I just freaked out.
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy for you and how much everyone loves you and how great you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You did nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope,"No, No, no."
Leslie Knope,Holy
Leslie Knope,The smell is so much worse when you get up close.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't."
Leslie Knope,I've been spending the summer doing a lot of zoo promotions.
Leslie Knope,Parrots live a very long time.
Leslie Knope,So we had a birthday party for a parrot that turned 60.
Leslie Knope,Not out of it.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,I'm in the mainstream.
Leslie Knope,It was an accident.
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't stick my neck out."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it good to be able to just kind of horse around like this as friends?
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,There was no flirtatious meaning behind that playful punch I just gave your arm.
Leslie Knope,"Just to be clear, that was a friend punch."
Leslie Knope,"Brendanawicz, you big sandwich eater."
Leslie Knope,"Still, you couldn't have asked for better weather."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?
Leslie Knope,"Trumple gave me the endorsement, which is great, but really, the only endorsement that matters is Ben's, and I locked that sucker up a long time ago."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about endorse ten beers into my mouth, 'cause this has been an incredibly stressful evening."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, at least they're married."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"By the power vested in me from the Department of Parks and Recreation, I now pronounce you husband and wife!"
Leslie Knope,I do!
Leslie Knope,I do!
Leslie Knope,"Tux, do you take Flipper, to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
Leslie Knope,"And as part of our zoo promotion, we are going to give them a marriage ceremony, because they mate for life."
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Zoo recently purchased two South African blackfooted penguins, Tux and Flipper."
Leslie Knope,But they just flung their feces.
Leslie Knope,"And they like to fling their feces, so we were hoping that they would fling their hats."
Leslie Knope,"Chimpanzees are very smart, so we had them graduate from college."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Chief Trumple, nice to see you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry, but hold on a second there, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to say, ""I told you so,"" but"
Leslie Knope,I guess I'm kind of like queen of the gays.
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna find out my actual bra size.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, Ben and Derek are taking me shopping on Saturday."
Leslie Knope,"I had three drinks named after me, so that's pretty fun."
Leslie Knope,Show me what's hot Tell me what I got Can't read my Can't read my
Leslie Knope,"My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face"
Leslie Knope,"And there's two bisexual guys here, and I got both of their phone numbers."
Leslie Knope,I've met many interesting people.
Leslie Knope,I'm having such a nice time tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Can't read my Can't read my No, he can't read my poker face Blah, blah, blah, blah My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face"
Leslie Knope,And who they are is just stone cold gay.
Leslie Knope,"Just, it's... Everyone is just who they are."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"And they know how to have fun, and the dancing!"
Leslie Knope,You know why tonight's fun?
Leslie Knope,Get a drink!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're here!
Leslie Knope,"If you're my friend, you can drink for free!"
Leslie Knope,Go to the bar.
Leslie Knope,They're having a party in my honor!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,Let's dance!
Leslie Knope,Together we can change Pawnee forever!
Leslie Knope,I just have one thing to say!
Leslie Knope,You're chanting my name.
Leslie Knope,'Cause everyone's so gay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to tell you that I wasn't really trying to take a stand when I married those penguins."
Leslie Knope,That's huge.
Leslie Knope,What's the topic?
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of good candidates.
Leslie Knope,This is the reason why people don't go into politics.
Leslie Knope,Anything else? You want me to jump off a building? Perform hara-kiri?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Oh! Is that it?
Leslie Knope,We have caught up.
Leslie Knope,We talked about San Diego and about the six bad guys.
Leslie Knope,I think we're good.
Leslie Knope,"I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo."
Leslie Knope,Take your time.
Leslie Knope,I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone.
Leslie Knope,He said he's still in love with me.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"While you were in the bathroom, he said he was still in love with me."
Leslie Knope,Tom comes on the show all the time.
Leslie Knope,I just wish I were here under different circumstances.
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,It's kind of like the Meet the Press of our town.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo."
Leslie Knope,That was me.
Leslie Knope,I haven't even officially taken a stand on gay marriage.
Leslie Knope,Can you just not freak out?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Joan loves him.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,This is green.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm feeling a lot of confusing things right now.
Leslie Knope,He left?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,He said that?
Leslie Knope,And then we can use it around people and no one will know what we're talking about.
Leslie Knope,"Look, let's invent our own secret language that only we understand."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me, neither."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, what?"
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Leslie Knope,I hate salad.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Where's Ben?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,What were you thinking?
Leslie Knope,"It's a left, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Can you just uncuff him, please?"
Leslie Knope,Focusing on my career.
Leslie Knope,Not dating anyone yet.
Leslie Knope,"I have a plan, but, no, not now."
Leslie Knope,"Soon, probably."
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,And it was.
Leslie Knope,Because I firmly believed that it would be cute.
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I just want to let you know, I was really serious about that secret language."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe this is a gay bar.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would just like to say thank you so much for throwing me this party, especially on a night when the Colts are playing."
Leslie Knope,"Here's my credit card quick, now."
Leslie Knope,Gentlemen.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, dessert's overrated and gross."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, thank you so much for a lovely evening."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it's freeâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"That's so nice, but I need to tell you something."
Leslie Knope,I'm really enjoying this hug.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'd like to talk to Ben, and then I'd like the three of us to talk together."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,So who's talking now?
Leslie Knope,That's nice.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April."
Leslie Knope,"So let's just say, ""Thank you for the party, but we regretfully decline your offer to honor me."""
Leslie Knope,"Our position is, we have no position."
Leslie Knope,Here's the plan.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Where should I drink now?
Leslie Knope,"That was not my intention, at all."
Leslie Knope,Uh Ann has told me repeatedly not to get a perm.
Leslie Knope,But Ann's not here.
Leslie Knope,"So when the Ann's away, the mice get perms."
Leslie Knope,Cool.
Leslie Knope,The lady and you're the
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Alex gives my campaign legal advice, and Ann is the greatest human being ever invented."
Leslie Knope,So I'm gonna what?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, someone needs me."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go, and you two just hit it off now."
Leslie Knope,You crazy kids.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Martha, I wanna lease this house."
Leslie Knope,Thought it was gonna be more dramatic than that.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Martha, I wanna lease this house."
Leslie Knope,And the official report filed by the Health Department.
Leslie Knope,And Ann's.
Leslie Knope,His words.
Leslie Knope,"He would move into my place, but it's a scary nightmare hoarder nest."
Leslie Knope,in ten days and he we are moving into a house together.
Leslie Knope,Ben is coming back from D.C.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"But no trampoline room, correct?"
Leslie Knope,What are you wearing?
Leslie Knope,I love you too.
Leslie Knope,"But you're gonna have to take out a lot of cursing, 'cause like I said, I am very fired up."
Leslie Knope,You're the greatest.
Leslie Knope,I'm just so happy that Ben and I are starting our life together and my future's finally back on track.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna kick all their asses! I am so fired up! I'm gonna go right now and drink, like, 1,000 Red Bulls so I can draft a new bill to undo abstinence only."
Leslie Knope,"So hold on, what does this mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, this is my lawyer friend, Alex."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, taken."
Leslie Knope,So much stuff is happening right now.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,Are you serious?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Oh Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Gross.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, God."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,That would cheer me up.
Leslie Knope,Now I know exactly how FDR felt after Pearl Harbor.
Leslie Knope,Just when things start to turn around and they fall apart.
Leslie Knope,Florida?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I just feel so powerless."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I just applied for a lease."
Leslie Knope,"Look, so are you gonna do it?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,And swamp sharks.
Leslie Knope,And swamps.
Leslie Knope,They have sharks in Florida.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"My dentist Is 80, and he's gay, and he's taken."
Leslie Knope,Uh what's this?
Leslie Knope,P. Hut
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Pizza Hut!"
Leslie Knope,"Hold on Hi, how cute are you?"
Leslie Knope,We were supposed to
Leslie Knope,But you know what? I don't even care.
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Sun is calling me ""Loose-ly Grope."""
Leslie Knope,They're killing me in the press.
Leslie Knope,Who wants some?
Leslie Knope,"Tell you what, condoms for everybody!"
Leslie Knope,"You put a condom on it, and you pull the tip like this, and you roll it all the way down the penis."
Leslie Knope,"This is a penis, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wish I could, but I Oh, screw it."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"""The devil likes to hide ""in all your private nooks and crannies, ""and if you open too wide, he might get out, or in."""
Leslie Knope,"""Our bodies are God's gift, ""but they're also the devil's playground."
Leslie Knope,"Perhaps you might understand it better if I read to you from this pamphlet, So you think you know more than God."
Leslie Knope,The best way to be safe is to simply postpone sex until marriage.
Leslie Knope,But I have a new message for you.
Leslie Knope,Safe sex for everybody!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, my aged friends."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you very much, Marshall."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, please do not lecture me about acting like myself."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, looks like you already met Jeff."
Leslie Knope,"When you dated Chris, you dressed in spandex."
Leslie Knope,"When you dated Andy, you dressed in flannels."
Leslie Knope,You're dressed like a cowboy!
Leslie Knope,You want me to act like myself?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I guess we're going there."
Leslie Knope,You know where we're going.
Leslie Knope,You want to go there?
Leslie Knope,Some of you might remember that I was here before.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, who wants to party?"
Leslie Knope,It's a censure from the mayor's office.
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we use every weapon that we have? I know that most of you don't agree with me on this, but I'm going to fight very hard to change your minds, and until then, I will take this censure, and I will wear it proudly, like a badge of honor."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we all want the same thing, right? We want fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer STDs."
Leslie Knope,To continue this policy is insane.
Leslie Knope,States that teach abstinence only have the highest rates of teen pregnancy and STDs.
Leslie Knope,Apologize for the antiquated laws in this city.
Leslie Knope,"Perd, I'd like to apologize."
Leslie Knope,"Tell that to the folks at Pier 1, an establishment I'm no longer allowed inside."
Leslie Knope,That doesn't really apply here.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what they say, ""You break it, you buy it."""
Leslie Knope,It means that I have been formally disciplined for breaking the law.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's good, but I'll tell you, he'll never lasso another heifer as fine as you, Annie Oakley."
Leslie Knope,Yikes.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, continue."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but I still feel terrible."
Leslie Knope,I feel terrible about what I said too.
Leslie Knope,"I got censured, it's a big deal."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Why am I still weirdly scared of you?
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,What's my move here?
Leslie Knope,You're my boss.
Leslie Knope,"I know I'm supposed to help educate the public, but I also have an obligation to uphold the laws."
Leslie Knope,This is no joke.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at the paper quality."
Leslie Knope,It's so official.
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, taken."
Leslie Knope,"How is he, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"No, it stinks."
Leslie Knope,"We only raised 1,200 dollars."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Jerry, but your future has been canceled."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's not as bad as I thought it would be."
Leslie Knope,"How would you, uh, um What are you gonna do to her?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay Sir, what would you do with your 900 dollars date?"
Leslie Knope,Anybody beat it please?
Leslie Knope,Who wants to beat it?
Leslie Knope,"Let's beat that, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,That's so great.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, 900 from the man with the tank top and the tattoos."
Leslie Knope,Uhoh.
Leslie Knope,It's not even close to what you need.
Leslie Knope,Can I get 3?
Leslie Knope,200 for the smartest and most accomplished woman I know.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,200
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have a $100 bid for Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"I dwell, I don't know, I"
Leslie Knope,Three out of four married couples have met each other at spontaneous auctions.
Leslie Knope,"This could be great, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Please, we need to do this for Jerry and his future."
Leslie Knope,Let's raise some money.
Leslie Knope,"Either way, it's for a good cause."
Leslie Knope,"Don't try anything, but, you know, give it a shot."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, well done."
Leslie Knope,And check out that bod.
Leslie Knope,"No, she's not into it."
Leslie Knope,"With all your bills, and the inevitable followup problems, and the lifetime of chronic misery that awaits you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, your life is so depressing."
Leslie Knope,"In 1832, Ben's great great great great grandfather, Teodore Wyatt, a bastard, met a beautiful seamstress from Antwerp."
Leslie Knope,Let me start from the beginning.
Leslie Knope,And it's a nonconflict diamond.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,I'm good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I need to remember every little thing about how perfect my life is right now at this exact moment.
Leslie Knope,"Just I need another second, please."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, hold on."
Leslie Knope,Gimme a second.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you had this whole plan for your retirement and your beach house and now you're future is just a huge pile of crap."
Leslie Knope,Just I need to remember this.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"What are you doing? Oh, my God, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't know you were coming back here.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, is there a way I could put down, like a"
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Leslie Knope,"All right, Martha."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Just wanted to look at it one more time.
Leslie Knope,"Well, my boyfriend might not be moving back for a while so I have to back out."
Leslie Knope,No thank you.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"But you never know, right?"
Leslie Knope,Don't even try it.
Leslie Knope,Nothing fresh.
Leslie Knope,So there are some special auction items I will be dealing with.
Leslie Knope,You brought Orin?
Leslie Knope,"Ann is not some weird, morose mummy."
Leslie Knope,"Offense intended, Orin."
Leslie Knope,Let this be a wakeup call about the way you present yourself to the world.
Leslie Knope,"As many of your know, Jerry Gergich, our friend, has suffered a devastating fart attack, and we are here to help."
Leslie Knope,I ask you to do one thing.
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,Do you know how hard I've been working to try to pull this together before Ann gets here?
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,One time I sprained my wrist and our insurance claimed that having a wrist was a preexisting condition.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee municipal employee health care plan is kinda crappy.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you're here."
Leslie Knope,How are you?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I have arranged for the Parks Department to throw a huge garage sale fundraiser for Jerry to help pay for his hospital bills."
Leslie Knope,Just leave it to us.
Leslie Knope,"What about a wedding where you used to go out with the groom, and you're the only one there without a date, so the bride makes you dance to Single Ladies by yourself?"
Leslie Knope,You are gonna have the future that you've always planned.
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry, Jerry, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"Let's get a drink, and then you and I are gonna have some fun."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"There was supposed to be, like, 20 guys here for Ann, and there's only four."
Leslie Knope,Who else do we have?
Leslie Knope,Give it to me straight.
Leslie Knope,We weren't talking about you.
Leslie Knope,The first item up for bid is an inscribed autobiography from Pawnee newscaster Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you're here."
Leslie Knope,The book's entitled The Thing About Me Is I'm Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,"Unless she's into that, but no, she's not."
Leslie Knope,"Just dinner and dancing, nothing sexual."
Leslie Knope,Please get your gigolo out of here.
Leslie Knope,One evening with the most beautiful woman in the world.
Leslie Knope,"Look at her, folks."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,An evening with sexy nurse Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope,A wonderful surprise item.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have a new item up for bid."
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Leslie Knope,"We need to do something very drastic so he can be happy, so we can all be happy."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"You might not care about Jerry's future, but I do."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann, bad."
Leslie Knope,"Love you, too."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, you know, obviously you gotta take it, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how was the meeting?"
Leslie Knope,"Um, can you just okay."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we need some big bids Oh, excuse me one second."
Leslie Knope,"It's a one of a kind autograph from mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is our final auction item."
Leslie Knope,Do I see 30?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you sir, for 20."
Leslie Knope,20 dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, let's start the bidding at 20 dollars."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's having a heart attack.
Leslie Knope,"Let's get to work, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's the law."
Leslie Knope,"""Chapter three."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but I have to tell you something."
Leslie Knope,Chris and Ann are on a secret date.
Leslie Knope,"Which is crazy because he's her boss, which is the exact situation we were in, except we were put on trial for it."
Leslie Knope,"And I know I'm not supposed to care, and I'm supposed to let it go, and we should just have a romantic dinner"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there's a lot of salad dressing on your hand."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love you so much."
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to see the look on Chris' remarkably youthful face when we march in there and confront him
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do I have your vote?"
Leslie Knope,Ahh! Shh.
Leslie Knope,He shoots down a very helpful bill 'cause he doesn't get to poop wherever he wants?
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,I'm not happy.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,Tom and Ann are on a date.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean you know? How do you know?
Leslie Knope,This isn't even about policy?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Committee chairmanship?
Leslie Knope,Support of one of your bills?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm gonna get Councilman Milton, and you can put your butt back in your pants, sir."
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,I really tried to make that hard.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, I move that the bill be read in its entirety."
Leslie Knope,"What do you want, April?"
Leslie Knope,"God, you know me so well."
Leslie Knope,"Why did I say that, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,I take it back.
Leslie Knope,"After all the hoops that Ben and I had to jump through because of the boss employee thing, it is absolutely my business."
Leslie Knope,"You're right, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I hate the government.
Leslie Knope,I hate it.
Leslie Knope,"I'm trying to tell everybody that the government is great, and I think it stinks."
Leslie Knope,"Chris needs to explain himself, and Ann lied to me about this date."
Leslie Knope,I do not negotiate with dentists.
Leslie Knope,I'm very impressed with you.
Leslie Knope,I have excellent toothbrush technique.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, so many injustices."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know, maybe we should, you know, postpone the vote until the councilman gets better, you know?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,I will let it go for now.
Leslie Knope,"But I want you to know that I think there is some Okay, she hung up on me."
Leslie Knope,We can kiss if you want to.
Leslie Knope,"Please, still be able to vote."
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,"At first you did not understand what made this tiny horse so special, and now you love him more than I do."
Leslie Knope,Please be okay.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,Jamm!
Leslie Knope,Iceland.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I love passionate speakers and Italian men."
Leslie Knope,"The bill is dead, the Porpoises are doomed, and democracy is over."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't mean I love Mussolini.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, a word, please."
Leslie Knope,Our positive attitude is our greatest asset.
Leslie Knope,It's very important that we stay positive.
Leslie Knope,Not as much as Irish Scottish? White whatever you are.
Leslie Knope,This is the weirdest Valentine's Day ever.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't be an alarmist."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know how to do math, Mason."
Leslie Knope,This isn't over by a long shot.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I decided to get a perm.
Leslie Knope,"Now, wait, okay, hold on."
Leslie Knope,"No parties, you hate parties."
Leslie Knope,The scavenger hunt?
Leslie Knope,"Yep, I understand."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I got it, Ron."
Leslie Knope,The perm must wait.
Leslie Knope,"The perm must wait, Autumn!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need to have an emergency strategy session now."
Leslie Knope,The vote is in an hour.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,He promised me.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,Ann should have never let me do this.
Leslie Knope,"You know, this is why people hate the government."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause just when we're about to do something really good, it all falls apart due to some stupid, selfish jerk butt."
Leslie Knope,This might not work.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's very hard to tell."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, you have grandchildren"
Leslie Knope,"The more we eat, the faster we talk."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, eat some."
Leslie Knope,"""Deintegrate Baseball."""
Leslie Knope,Their platform?
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton was first elected as a city councilor in 1948, as a member of the Dixiecrat Party."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, I'd like to talk to you about the Fun In The Sun bill, and I don't mean to rush you, but the vote is in an hour."
Leslie Knope,How do I look?
Leslie Knope,I just need to hurry up.
Leslie Knope,He won't even know what he's doing.
Leslie Knope,"He's an old person, and I'll talk to him really slowly."
Leslie Knope,And he'll give us his vote.
Leslie Knope,You know what I'm hearing? You tried to make Ann happy for Valentine's Day.
Leslie Knope,And and kids love to swim.
Leslie Knope,You're a very nice person.
Leslie Knope,"He's got grandkids, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are."
Leslie Knope,Very nice person.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I do not understand this.
Leslie Knope,This really confuses me.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going to try to get Councilman Milton's vote.
Leslie Knope,Screw Jamm.
Leslie Knope,"You know, screw Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Ms. Beavers?
Leslie Knope,"There's a party in your pants and no one is invited."""
Leslie Knope,You can have my office.
Leslie Knope,And I will get Invisaligns from you.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Chris, what do you think about changing the music?"
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,You should look on the bright side.
Leslie Knope,"I know this is a personal question, but how many of you out there are sexually active?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm councilwoman Leslie Knope, and today we are here to talk about safe sex."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure that Millicent couldn't keep up with you on your runs, so now you can go full speed again."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, can everyone hear me okay?"
Leslie Knope,"That's how you do it, kids."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,I want to jump on that caboose.
Leslie Knope,"No, your best is still ahead of you."
Leslie Knope,"I think you're good to go, nursey."
Leslie Knope,I haven't had my monthly since LBJ was president.
Leslie Knope,"I'm an old lady, why do I need birth control?"
Leslie Knope,I'll start.
Leslie Knope,You don't look a day over 30.
Leslie Knope,"Let's pretend that we're old people, and we can ask Ann our grossest, most perverted sex questions."
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Who says that?
Leslie Knope,"They're hopped up on E.D. medication and they got nothing to lose, 'cause they're close to death."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sex avengers, these old fogies are very set in their ways."
Leslie Knope,Choo choo!
Leslie Knope,It's amazing what a few old guys can do with a little bit of charm and a lot of crabs.
Leslie Knope,Does anyone know what we risk when we have unprotected sex?
Leslie Knope,And the best way to prevent them is to use protection.
Leslie Knope,Put away your sex toys and play with them on your own time.
Leslie Knope,"There's no other option, Ann."
Leslie Knope,It's political suicide.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't fight those numbers even if I wanted to.
Leslie Knope,The people support this.
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,"Look, we need an emergency task force meeting."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, pack up our bananas!"
Leslie Knope,It is far from over.
Leslie Knope,It is not over.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's what I want."
Leslie Knope,"No, Jeff."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but the truth is, the greatest risk you face is sexually transmitted diseases."
Leslie Knope,"Marcia is motivated, calculating, and hypervigilant, and her husband, Marshall, is vivacious."
Leslie Knope,Marcia and Marshall Langman are the town's morality watchdogs.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go talk to Chris.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,You go help Ann.
Leslie Knope,"She's not responding to my top candidates, so we're gonna have to go with some wild cards."
Leslie Knope,And April Thanks for nothing.
Leslie Knope,Why should I do anything to help her?
Leslie Knope,"Because despite the fact that all you do is give her a hard time, she would do this for you."
Leslie Knope,Just go hide under the table with your friend Orin.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I see you, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,What happening?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,How am I supposed to find the love of Ann's life when it sounds like a funeral in here?
Leslie Knope,"A lot of them haven't had proper sex education, and as a result, STDs are having a field day."
Leslie Knope,"Seniors in Pawnee have a lot of time on their hands, and what they're doing with that time is going at it hard, old people style."
Leslie Knope,There are a lot of soul mates in the world.
Leslie Knope,"Yay, democracy! Oh, no, my perm."
Leslie Knope,Try to cheer her up.
Leslie Knope,"Um Um, because it's fun in the sun! Everybody in the pool!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can you not say that in front of the kids, please? I'm trying to teach them how great government is."
Leslie Knope,And I can be late meeting Ben.
Leslie Knope,Everybody's excited? I bet you are! Because your bill just became law.
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,I want you to arrange yourselves from most excited about democracy to least excited.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's get ready for the photo, guys."
Leslie Knope,"He's not gonna be on time, 'cause those clues are hard."
Leslie Knope,"They're really, really hard, and I'm really worried that he's not gonna be able to figure it out."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky bastard."
Leslie Knope,Ta da.
Leslie Knope,Look at Ann.
Leslie Knope,She using the emergency mini curling iron that I gave her.
Leslie Knope,She has a date.
Leslie Knope,Why wouldn't she tell me who it is?
Leslie Knope,Because she doesn't want me to know.
Leslie Knope,Because it's someone she shouldn't be dating.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, the music's better."
Leslie Knope,Have you seen Chris?
Leslie Knope,She's going to meet Chris.
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Leslie Knope,And I hate you.
Leslie Knope,And shut up.
Leslie Knope,"And, that is enough."
Leslie Knope,She's putting on makeup.
Leslie Knope,"It sucks being alone on Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna take Ann out for a drink, you know."
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at Ann."
Leslie Knope,"You dated her, and she's a perfect human specimen, and you tossed her out like day old chowder."
Leslie Knope,But it's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,Buck up.
Leslie Knope,Great news: Lots of old people have chlamydia.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,How is your evening unfolding in terms of your conversations with men?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone."
Leslie Knope,How lucky that that happened to you on Valentine's Day.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,Your boy cow cow boy.
Leslie Knope,From your cowboy boyfriend.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that makes it sound like he's a cow."
Leslie Knope,A cowboy hat from your cowboy friend.
Leslie Knope,What's with the getup?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,To making things happen.
Leslie Knope,Stay.
Leslie Knope,He's a punk.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, can you just do me a favor and give me your car keys for a second?"
Leslie Knope,There's something I need to look at on your car keys.
Leslie Knope,I ain't scared of him.
Leslie Knope,You know me too well.
Leslie Knope,And the Tommy Haverford member's chair.
Leslie Knope,"But it is also Pawnee's newest and most exclusive cigar club, Tom's Smokehouse."
Leslie Knope,"And it is across the courtyard from your office, so we can wave at each other."
Leslie Knope,You can have my parking space.
Leslie Knope,"If you want to come and talk to me or ask me questions or raise an issue, this is where I'll be."
Leslie Knope,Those are my office hours.
Leslie Knope,"Every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., I will be here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Amazingly, yes."
Leslie Knope,With due respect
Leslie Knope,"If I could just get a little bit more time, I could figure out how to fix this."
Leslie Knope,And then I think
Leslie Knope,I just need one more week.
Leslie Knope,what now?
Leslie Knope,"Muncie, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,Got rid of a bunch of lameass D1's from Public Works.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,We saved the animal shelter and the Parks budget.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, campaign."
Leslie Knope,"No, I will not let you return to a life of shaving wieners and dodging knife attacks from meth heads."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,This is Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Do you think Barack and Michelle Obama feel like this at the end of the day?
Leslie Knope,Looks like we found a bigger bottle.
Leslie Knope,We get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operating while still maintaining the Parks budget.
Leslie Knope,It's an oversight.
Leslie Knope,This is it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Andy put them on the table 'cause he wanted to try to have the dogs play poker.
Leslie Knope,"Meanwhile, you and I are gonna look at the town budget and we're gonna find something expendable."
Leslie Knope,"I'm very proud of you, April."
Leslie Knope,"April, that would be the coolest thing since 'N Sync, Aerosmith, and Nelly performed together at the Super Bowl halftime show."
Leslie Knope,This is only temporary until I find a way to keep the shelter open without cutting the Parks budget.
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,"So apparently, Newport just fired his campaign manager because Ben was kicking his ass."
Leslie Knope,Or we find money somewhere else.
Leslie Knope,Stop talking.
Leslie Knope,I will cut back to 10 hours a week.
Leslie Knope,15
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Leslie Knope,See ya next week!
Leslie Knope,She'll take care of that.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna kick his ass.
Leslie Knope,"And your guy Bobby Newport is gonna have to show up, and he's gonna have to open his mouth."
Leslie Knope,"Because in a week, we have a debate."
Leslie Knope,"A safe home for the animals, a job for my friend, and a full Parks budget."
Leslie Knope,"Because I told councilman Pillner that if you don't agree to our terms, he should cut the Parks budget."
Leslie Knope,Has anyone told you that yet?
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't drink the tap water.
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted to say I'm sorry that I screwed up your birthday party."
Leslie Knope,But we all pitched in.
Leslie Knope,You're going to announce that Bobby Newport will use his personal fortune to save the animal shelter.
Leslie Knope,"Just one item, Jennifer."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I'm going to commit political suicide."
Leslie Knope,And we are sending you and Gayle to a B&B in your favorite place in the world.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now I have a complete idea."
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,I'm No!
Leslie Knope,Heh.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,I have half an idea and I'm putting it together.
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, the water's not good for you either."
Leslie Knope,Ben is the best campaign manager anyone could ever have.
Leslie Knope,Every move he's made has worked.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that is a pig."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Jones, such a pleasure to meet you."
Leslie Knope,Please don't get up.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'm in a good mood.
Leslie Knope,Is this politics?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,What could possibly be wrong about me saving the Parks department budget?
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Three words: Ramp Up Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Our department is the only thing between her and a life of tube tops and tribal tattoos and barfing in hot tubs.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is way behind the times in terms of making its buildings wheelchair accessible.
Leslie Knope,"Not enough ramps is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors Right behind ""everything hurts"" and ""I'm dying."""
Leslie Knope,"He's important, and he's old."
Leslie Knope,She's enrolled in five of our parks programs.
Leslie Knope,"Hold that cork, sir because I'm about to put an adorable face on your proposed cuts."
Leslie Knope,"If you hear any of them talking about that ""blonde pain in the ass,"" that's me."
Leslie Knope,I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, that cannot happen."
Leslie Knope,"Now I realize that you're drafting the new city budget, and I've heard that you're planning on reducing the parks funding by 8%."
Leslie Knope,"Well, but you should watch that documentary."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,In his seminal 2009 documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the national park system as a America's best idea.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, could I have a moment?"
Leslie Knope,There's another soft one.
Leslie Knope,Look at this one.
Leslie Knope,I love amenities.
Leslie Knope,Meet Melody Sternway.
Leslie Knope,"The ""grond"" father, he's like It doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,Because the city councilor listened to me.
Leslie Knope,It means I have some juice.
Leslie Knope,This one right here?
Leslie Knope,"He's like a brilliant, sexy, little hummingbird."
Leslie Knope,You talking about this one?
Leslie Knope,Which one?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make pancakes.
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Keep up the good work.
Leslie Knope,You're doing great.
Leslie Knope,Do you want pancakes?
Leslie Knope,I adopted 32 cats and dogs.
Leslie Knope,How did you sleep?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, honey, good morning."
Leslie Knope,We can figure something else out.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we can fix this."
Leslie Knope,"And to get the gray vote, you need to get the endorsement of Ned Jones."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,Are we okay?
Leslie Knope,So did Pillner finalize the budget?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,He's the president of Pawnee Seniors United.
Leslie Knope,He's like The Godfather but old.
Leslie Knope,"Gimme a spin, baby."
Leslie Knope,I'm just really into you.
Leslie Knope,Enjoying the view.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Which I do.
Leslie Knope,Did he do all this just for you?
Leslie Knope,Is the menu all set?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I want to attack him.
Leslie Knope,"No, I got it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we did everything, Ron."
Leslie Knope,We got new signs.
Leslie Knope,We put them in people's yards.
Leslie Knope,We got Jerry for the surprise sinkhole emergency.
Leslie Knope,"And, uh, we briefly ran out of gas, and then we walked to the gas station."
Leslie Knope,"We got more gas, and now we're all good."
Leslie Knope,Just let me attack him.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure out as I'm saying it.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I have to attack him.
Leslie Knope,I can do it.
Leslie Knope,He's more confident now.
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,What a crappy stunt to pull.
Leslie Knope,How could they do that to this town?
Leslie Knope,So Sweetums is gonna move to Mexico if Bobby doesn't win?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Police, fire, parks, and schools."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you should've thought about that before we dragged you out of the bath, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Let's spend our money on what matters.
Leslie Knope,"I was in favor of closing the borders bookstore, not the border to Mexico."
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I agree that movies should be more faithful to the books that they are based on, but what does that have to do with this election?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I need to go back on the attack.
Leslie Knope,I think we attack him.
Leslie Knope,"Everything he's saying is nonsense, and he's fooling them."
Leslie Knope,I can crush him.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but you're the brilliant campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,"No, I think you should deliver the news."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how was the spin room?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Was I too mean?
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,And I promise you I'm not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,You are my family.
Leslie Knope,This is my home.
Leslie Knope,"And if push too hard, it's because things aren't moving fast enough."
Leslie Knope,"If I come on strong, it's because I feel strongly."
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Leslie Knope,"If I seem too passionate, it's because I care."
Leslie Knope,You put it first.
Leslie Knope,You take care of it.
Leslie Knope,You fight for it.
Leslie Knope,You don't punish it.
Leslie Knope,"And when you love something, you don't threaten it."
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport and his daddy would like you to think it belongs to them.
Leslie Knope,That power belongs to the people.
Leslie Knope,Corporations are not allowed to dictate what a city needs.
Leslie Knope,It's despicable.
Leslie Knope,I'm angry that Bobby Newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you don't give him what he wants.
Leslie Knope,I'm very angry.
Leslie Knope,"As your city councilor, I will make sure that no one takes advantage of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,How is he winning?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, he's winning."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, as soon as we open this door, everything will become clear."
Leslie Knope,2012
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Pump it up.
Leslie Knope,Power.
Leslie Knope,Fierce.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,"Surprise! Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"What happened? Well, you slept with Jerry last night."
Leslie Knope,"No, I was planning Jerry's morning surprise party."
Leslie Knope,Morning surprise parties are always the best.
Leslie Knope,Let's get going.
Leslie Knope,I love it when you're needlessly disgusting.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Donna?"
Leslie Knope,What if the town loves Bobby more than me?
Leslie Knope,I have.
Leslie Knope,I got this.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,I believe that I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,"I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,This is a lot bigger than my high school debate auditorium.
Leslie Knope,How old were you?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Seats, like, 800 people."
Leslie Knope,Can't believe we're doing this here.
Leslie Knope,I finally get a chance to stand in front of everyone and talk about the town that I love.
Leslie Knope,Nothing gets me more amped than Sarah McLachlan.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Who's first?
Leslie Knope,Surprise!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, what the [Bleep]?"
Leslie Knope,Some of us believe that you need to roll up your sleeves and do the hard work yourself.
Leslie Knope,"That's a very sweet story, Bobby, but not all of us have Yolandas who can clean up our room for us."
Leslie Knope,"If I may, Joan."
Leslie Knope,Where the hell is everybody?
Leslie Knope,I have no more time left?
Leslie Knope,I will say that the parks in Pawnee
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, okay."
Leslie Knope,It's difficult to get into the complicated problems with Ramsett Park in such a short amount of time.
Leslie Knope,Wake everybody up.
Leslie Knope,"No, I am not gonna let this fall apart."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna throw Jerry an amazing Sweet 16 surprise party no matter how agonizing it is for all of us.
Leslie Knope,And maybe that's because he's never earned anything his entire life.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,I believe that I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,"I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and I like you."
Leslie Knope,Here's what I know.
Leslie Knope,I have the best campaign manager in the world.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,I believe I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,I've worked my whole life to make it great.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I want everyone to go around and tell their favorite Jerry story."
Leslie Knope,A positive one.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,This is like girl heaven.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, is that Yep!"
Leslie Knope,And last year the five people that he profiled all won.
Leslie Knope,"Buddy Wood hosts the number one morning show in Indianapolis, and he wants to interview me for a series he's doing on local elections."
Leslie Knope,"To win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky."
Leslie Knope,Lose this?
Leslie Knope,"Can't wait for the interview."""
Leslie Knope,"Like, ""hey, nice to meet you."
Leslie Knope,It's my new interview outfit.
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,I would have if Bobby Newport hadn't gotten those stupid companies to build factories here.
Leslie Knope,Literally.
Leslie Knope,How are we going to beat her?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,This is a huge break for us.
Leslie Knope,"I am going to get drunk, and then I'm going to order a three-course meal where each course is made of dessert."
Leslie Knope,It's certainly not here.
Leslie Knope,It was in the Pawnee papers.
Leslie Knope,"It wasn't in the New York Times or Le Monde, which is what she reads."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, maybe you hadn't heard of it."
Leslie Knope,What Bobby Newport cares about is romping around on some beach in Spain with a floozy.
Leslie Knope,"What this is about is Pawnee, and that is what I care about."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think I can.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,She's just doing this for the money.
Leslie Knope,She doesn't even like her own client.
Leslie Knope,This could be the best case scenario for us.
Leslie Knope,"And I think Pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stays in the city, like I do."
Leslie Knope,"Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper."
Leslie Knope,Keep going.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,It's like dealing with a strict mother who I am confusingly attracted to.
Leslie Knope,"It's just This campaign has turned fun, dorky Ben into grumpy, stressball Ben."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I love him."
Leslie Knope,Should we get another round?
Leslie Knope,This was such a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Do you know Joe Biden?
Leslie Knope,He's on my celebrity sex list.
Leslie Knope,"Well, he is my celebrity sex list."
Leslie Knope,Who's gonna drink with me?
Leslie Knope,And I have a serious excess of preinterview adrenaline.
Leslie Knope,My hair looks amazing.
Leslie Knope,I can still hear you.
Leslie Knope,I got a new outfit.
Leslie Knope,Everybody's been working so hard.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, why don't we all go get a drink, blow off some steam?"
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, did anyone even get hurt?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, those endless scarves that come out of your sleeves like a magician."
Leslie Knope,"But do I need a hat, like a bowler, or an edgy scarf?"
Leslie Knope,I think this is it.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,But I bet these pants will work for the public.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, screw it."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario.
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario!
Leslie Knope,I'm over here.
Leslie Knope,Just about to start my presentation.
Leslie Knope,"I uhoh, stairs."
Leslie Knope,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,How do I get from here to there?
Leslie Knope,I'm not a professional mountain climber.
Leslie Knope,"It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game."
Leslie Knope,What plan?
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.
Leslie Knope,"God, you're good."
Leslie Knope,How do you know that
Leslie Knope,Yoohoo.
Leslie Knope,My idea is better.
Leslie Knope,"Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work."
Leslie Knope,I've been practicing it the whole way over here.
Leslie Knope,Let me get my insults out.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"I would never accept anything from a twofaced, carpetbagging"
Leslie Knope,"You are a twofaced, carpet"
Leslie Knope,"Hi, nice to see you, too."
Leslie Knope,"You twofaced, carpetbagging"
Leslie Knope,Jennifer Barkley.
Leslie Knope,That sounds good.
Leslie Knope,He's making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Leslie Knope,""" We are getting our butts kicked by a guy who is not even in the country."
Leslie Knope,"Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that."
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Perd,"" first of all, and no."
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh They did, they stole our idea."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's official.
Leslie Knope,I hate Jennifer Barkley.
Leslie Knope,"When I go to that senior center, I'm going to go up onstage, and I'm going to viciously attack her."
Leslie Knope,"So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager?"
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,"And I should listen to you always because you are a man genius with a taut, narrow frame like a sexy, elf king."
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,You're perfect.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you."
Leslie Knope,But she knows that I know that she knows that She's in our heads.
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it."
Leslie Knope,But what if she's right?
Leslie Knope,And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.
Leslie Knope,I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.
Leslie Knope,Course you did.
Leslie Knope,JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,What would you do instead?
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't."
Leslie Knope,Which you did.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ben is like a MILF.
Leslie Knope,I think I'm gonna cry.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Tell me about it!
Leslie Knope,That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen.
Leslie Knope,Why are you smiling?
Leslie Knope,Why is this terrifying information making you smile?
Leslie Knope,So what do we do next?
Leslie Knope,"Ah, that's so sweet I've never had a boyfriend threaten to commit arson for me before."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I am so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"As a candidate, I appreciate your strategic mind, but as woman, all I care about is your slight but powerful body."
Leslie Knope,And sheep don't eat it.
Leslie Knope,"I know what tiramisu is, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"C'mon Buddy, you cannot air that tape."
Leslie Knope,This is because of the wire.
Leslie Knope,Oh This this is not because I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,She's eating egg salad with Colin Powell.
Leslie Knope,This interview is over.
Leslie Knope,I am not drunk.
Leslie Knope,That was bad timing.
Leslie Knope,Are you inebriated?
Leslie Knope,Preposterous.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Ben and I first
Leslie Knope,"I've had a couple drinks, so what the hell?"
Leslie Knope,But you know what?
Leslie Knope,"Well, like I said, I don't want to discuss it, Buddy, and, frankly, I don't appreciate your condescending tone."
Leslie Knope,"But if you'd like, we can talk about ways that I can improve the airport or our many wonderful parks."
Leslie Knope,"Buddy, frankly, I don't want to discuss that."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, when you have a jumbo Margarita and some flaming Tequila shots, you can get drunk."
Leslie Knope,I would rather talk about the ways to solve problems in this town.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and check out this picture."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, um Mr. Wood, I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Holy hell, that's soft."
Leslie Knope,Is he gone?
Leslie Knope,My sneak around clothes.
Leslie Knope,Is the coast clear?
Leslie Knope,He doesn't even know it yet.
Leslie Knope,"It's, it's on."
Leslie Knope,He's about to get lucky.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, not all of it."
Leslie Knope,I think we may have used up all our luck tonight.
Leslie Knope,And I'm super lucky that that tape disappeared.
Leslie Knope,And I'm lucky that Ann and Tom and all my other friends volunteer to help me out.
Leslie Knope,I got pretty damn lucky when I met Ben.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God Newport hired a real Washington hotshot.
Leslie Knope,"They say to win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky."
Leslie Knope,Goodbye.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,That's five pleases.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"We drove here to ask you, No, to beg you to please destroy that tape."
Leslie Knope,It's so bright out here.
Leslie Knope,"Like I always say, stairs are a young man's game."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, who?"
Leslie Knope,"We, oh, my God, I can't see."
Leslie Knope,Yay! Fun Ben lives.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've discussed that many times, and there's really nothing more to say."
Leslie Knope,"Well, granted, we don't have big city amenities, but I think we more than make up for it with friendly faces and handworking hards hardworking hands."
Leslie Knope,I am gonna work very hard to change
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Big idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I have to do well.
Leslie Knope,"This is a game changer, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, this interview is a big deal, you guys."
Leslie Knope,"I mean ""lunky."""
Leslie Knope,"We are so ""drucky."""
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,The interview is back on!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, here comes me To the airport."
Leslie Knope,Why are you from Russia?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm watching Murder She Wrote.
Leslie Knope,"I'm watching, um Murder She Wrote."
Leslie Knope,"I'm in, uh, the house watching TV right now."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I mean Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Lady Knope.
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Dingdong.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,What could be wrong with that?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I feel totally normal."
Leslie Knope,I'm ready to do this.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, for Leslie Knope, anytime."
Leslie Knope,"Joe has been working here since 1996, and his salary has not been raised a nickel."
Leslie Knope,"Joe, say hi."
Leslie Knope,"Take, uh Joe Appledemas over there."
Leslie Knope,And that is why I'm going to make it a centerpiece of my platform.
Leslie Knope,It is in desperate need of refurbishments.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm glad you mentioned it."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for being on my show.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Marta."
Leslie Knope,It's my pleasure.
Leslie Knope,"We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do smart.
Leslie Knope,I don't seem distracted or babbly or anything?
Leslie Knope,I seem okay?
Leslie Knope,"Like, does everything seem fine?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, do I seem normal to you?"
Leslie Knope,I'll be right there.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the greatest city in the world."
Leslie Knope,Glad you could make it.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Buddy Wood.
Leslie Knope,"""Helpy"" to hop out."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at that."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you got those new I.D. badges."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Paul."
Leslie Knope,"Just let me know if you need anything else, all right?"
Leslie Knope,Right!
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are getting married, and I've been telling everybody about it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"I know, you guys, we only have one more day to close the gap, and we're going to do so in a onetime campaign blitz aboard the S.S. Knope"
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could sightsee together.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"You look great, April."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's go get some astronaut ice cream or something.
Leslie Knope,Guys.
Leslie Knope,Guys.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, uh, guys, let's motor."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's so good to see you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, you protect our nation's history, and you're a hero."
Leslie Knope,Farewell address candle stand.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, get down from there."
Leslie Knope,"1776, a nation is born."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk on the way.
Leslie Knope,"So you can see that the color changes about a third of the way up, and it's when construction was actually halted on the monument"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Because it's gum.
Leslie Knope,I think that's just gum.
Leslie Knope,Nothing in that movie is accurate.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,"""In this temple, ""As in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, grab the book, and let's hit the National Mall."
Leslie Knope,There were some notes in it.
Leslie Knope,I didn't I didn't mean literally.
Leslie Knope,So I want to see the history of the girl scouts and then Lincoln's pocket watch and the First Ladies exhibit and everything I want to see everything.
Leslie Knope,"Now throw it away, 'cause Leslie Knope is your guidebook."
Leslie Knope,That was the first thing I was going to see.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So we're gonna throw him a Sweet 16 surprise party.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be very special.
Leslie Knope,I'm here to present my application for the Federal Riverbed Preservation Grant.
Leslie Knope,"No, April, the unusual."
Leslie Knope,I have a 3:00 with Mr. Jepson.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"No, no fish."
Leslie Knope,Jerry only gets a real birthday every four years.
Leslie Knope,"And four years from now, who knows?"
Leslie Knope,"Three, four."
Leslie Knope,He might be retired Or dead.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love you so much."
Leslie Knope,We do.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Mm, no."
Leslie Knope,"The campaign can wait, 'cause this is official Parks business."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, can we use your lake house?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the only way we could be more awesome is if we had our own signature dance move."
Leslie Knope,Ben is off running a congressional campaign.
Leslie Knope,I've got a big meeting here.
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are a power couple, like the Roosevelts or the Clintons."
Leslie Knope,Can we use your house?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,And it was nice to see you again.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I brought you one."
Leslie Knope,Now take out your guidebook.
Leslie Knope,"That was really sneaky, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"I have, like, 50 of them."
Leslie Knope,From my office.
Leslie Knope,We'll do it all over Washington.
Leslie Knope,And then we make out in the Lincoln bedroom And the Jefferson Memorial and the Supreme Court gallery.
Leslie Knope,And then I go visit you again.
Leslie Knope,"I will visit you, then you come visit me."
Leslie Knope,We can make it work.
Leslie Knope,The very least I can do is try to return the favor.
Leslie Knope,You put your whole life on hold for me.
Leslie Knope,I was being selfish.
Leslie Knope,"Some day, when I'm more emotionally stable, I want to read the concession speech you wrote for me."
Leslie Knope,You have to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,I got you something.
Leslie Knope,Do you have both my speeches?
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,You deserve to win.
Leslie Knope,"If I lose, I'll never forgive myself."
Leslie Knope,"Every five minute coffee break at work, every night, every weekend, every spare moment of their lives, they gave to me."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for the last six months, my friends have worked so hard."
Leslie Knope,Figured this might be my last chance.
Leslie Knope,I was really looking forward to sitting in it.
Leslie Knope,That's interesting.
Leslie Knope,"Now, hang on."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there's no deal in the world that we would ever possibly"
Leslie Knope,Let me open it for you.
Leslie Knope,"The idea behind this campaign was a simple one: That with hard work and positivity, a group of people can make a difference during my term as your city councilor Thank you."
Leslie Knope,I want to focus on your hopes and not your fears.
Leslie Knope,I want to solve problems instead of creating friction.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Did I also just walk past a food truck and buy myself a waffle sundae?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Romantic reunions, government meetings, selfguided museum tours I mean, am I living the dream?"
Leslie Knope,It's a bit of a fixer upper.
Leslie Knope,"I'm here to visit, but I am also here to work, because I have a very important meeting where I am going to try to get federal funding so we can clean up the Pawnee river."
Leslie Knope,And he took April with him as his intern.
Leslie Knope,"My amazing lover, Ben Wyatt, is here working on a congressional campaign."
Leslie Knope,It's the Capitol.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it's not."
Leslie Knope,You can taste the sweet sugar of bureaucracy at work.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you can practically smell the bills becoming laws."
Leslie Knope,"Take a deep breath, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"Washington, D.C."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Let's go! City council, bitches!"
Leslie Knope,Nonnegotiable.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we're going to JJ's for victory waffles, and then we're staying up all night talking about our lives and our feelings."
Leslie Knope,Let's embark on a new journey together and see where it takes us.
Leslie Knope,"Not the old, out-of-date one that shows where we've been, but a crisp new one that shows where we might go."
Leslie Knope,Let's break out a map.
Leslie Knope,So let's embark on a new journey together.
Leslie Knope,No one achieves anything alone.
Leslie Knope,"I owe this victory, all of it, to my friends and my supporters."
Leslie Knope,"And I know firsthand, how very special the people of this city are."
Leslie Knope,And I will work hard every hour of every day to make Pawnee a better place to live because I love this city.
Leslie Knope,I'm not most people.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, [Bleep]."
Leslie Knope,64 divided by 4 is 16.
Leslie Knope,Now Jerry is turning 64 this year.
Leslie Knope,"No, April, I need to keep my work separate, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to just leave and give me a little privacy here, please."
Leslie Knope,"Could you give me a minute here, please?"
Leslie Knope,Just think of it like a fun game.
Leslie Knope,Parks is inside.
Leslie Knope,Campaign is outside.
Leslie Knope,Parks is inside.
Leslie Knope,Campaign's outside.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at your apartment later.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, that is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,"So wait, what was your question again?"
Leslie Knope,"No, you've talked about it, and I've ignored it, because it is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,City council is a parttime job.
Leslie Knope,Just go.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have time to spare."
Leslie Knope,"I'm also volunteering at ""Wheels For Meals On Wheels."
Leslie Knope,""" We repair vans for ""Meals On Wheels."""
Leslie Knope,Or I own four identical versions of the same sweater.
Leslie Knope,It's fine.
Leslie Knope,"And if you don't get out of here soon, I'm going to punch you in the face."
Leslie Knope,"That's the style now, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""lollipopping."""
Leslie Knope,All the kids are doing it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Need I remind you that even if I win the election, I can still work at the Parks department."
Leslie Knope,"You know what, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"I did not finish it, but I will finish it."
Leslie Knope,Nosy people have no respect for personal space.
Leslie Knope,"Point is, I'm going to clean up this river by myself."
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I was recently reminded by someone that I'm not the type of person to shy away from hard work."
Leslie Knope,"But things move pretty slow in Washington, and I'm not going to wait around."
Leslie Knope,I went to our nation's capital this weekend in order to apply for a federal grant to clean up our city's river.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you beautiful, rulebreaking moth."
Leslie Knope,You know we can't talk about my campaign in here.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I can't even get a meeting with some bureaucrat.
Leslie Knope,"I combined all of the giant, darkhaired, smartphone power goddesses into one woman called Hot Rebecca."
Leslie Knope,She's just this jealousy amalgam I created.
Leslie Knope,"I know I should be focusing on this river cleanup, but all I keep thinking about is Ben laughing in a helicopter with Hot Rebecca."
Leslie Knope,"When you're running for office, there are, like, a million rules of what you can and cannot do."
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And because I work for the government, I am not allowed to do anything campaign related inside a government building."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Outside.
Leslie Knope,It's kind of a pain in the ass.
Leslie Knope,But it's great exercise But it's a pain in the ass.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, Ben's life is filled with senators and briefings and Super PACs."
Leslie Knope,"I accept your apology, I will not take a sabbatical, as we agreed, and we will never discuss this again."
Leslie Knope,You're the most amazing boyfriend ever.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,I was just recently elected.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I forgot your birthday.
Leslie Knope,You're a big shot.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at you."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think."
Leslie Knope,"Um, I think okay."
Leslie Knope,This is unacceptable.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Birthdays are important.
Leslie Knope,Indiana.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,I'm a councilwoman.
Leslie Knope,I was also going to show a DVD that had some images of frolicking river otters.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I guess it did."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, you know, there's aa CD inside that, uh, plays the sound of a babbling river, and I was going to play that while I gave my presentation."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, Happy Birthday to Jerry."
Leslie Knope,You are a kind and wonderful soul.
Leslie Knope,It's kind of a special application.
Leslie Knope,Also I need you to do some fecal contamination testing at the reservoir.
Leslie Knope,Oh Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, go get a kit from maintenance, and I need you to check the water for bird dung."
Leslie Knope,Does he have office hours?
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, what are you doing standing here?"
Leslie Knope,Our water has poop in it.
Leslie Knope,I was told I would have a facetoface meeting with him so I could make my case for my town.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry we forgot yours.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It's called Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I'm not cranky.
Leslie Knope,"I saw 24 historical sights in a day, and it's 120 degrees out with 200% humidity, because this is a stupid swamp town."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just tired, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,"I just wanted to say that you are my role models, and, uh, you are incredibly amazing women, and it is an honor to meet you, and I really respect your grace under pressure, And thank you for your time."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm probably boring you."
Leslie Knope,We're overrun with raccoons and obese toddlers.
Leslie Knope,We've got tons of problems.
Leslie Knope,But it is.
Leslie Knope,We're small and unimportant.
Leslie Knope,But you've probably never heard of us.
Leslie Knope,"I am a city councilwoman from Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,How do you do?
Leslie Knope,"I can't wait to meet, like, five more tall women."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,It's like CSpan and Neiman Marcus had kids or something.
Leslie Knope,Why are they all so tall?
Leslie Knope,And they're tall.
Leslie Knope,"God, these women they're so smart and accomplished and pretty."
Leslie Knope,I think I need some fresh air.
Leslie Knope,Does anybody feel like they can't breathe?
Leslie Knope,"So, pretty big day for both of us."
Leslie Knope,And I was mistaken for Beverly D'Angelo by a Japanese tourist.
Leslie Knope,He scored a victory for the congressional campaign he's working on.
Leslie Knope,Ben and I both did some amazing things today.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, Missouri, is a total craphole."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Ah well, I should not have called Nick Newport a jerk, because we need to be respectful of all dead people."
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,Any questions?
Leslie Knope,"And that is Groffle, the awful Waffle, a book that I wrote and published on behalf of my education initiative."
Leslie Knope,""" The end."
Leslie Knope,"So as you can imagine, we would never have ordered a sign with all this complicated nonsense because, you know, we're not insane."
Leslie Knope,"""Welcome home."
Leslie Knope,bacon.
Leslie Knope,"""We're all your friends,"" said Mr."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"What's next on the ""schedge?"""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but we're going to do it in a classy and respectful way to get Ann off of our backs."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, not Stalin or Hitler, but I'm not calling Nick Newport Hitler."
Leslie Knope,We're going to keep campaigning.
Leslie Knope,But I'm going to.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, there is nothing harder in the entire world than saying no to your beautiful face."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,Not with that attitude.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, try to beat what he said."
Leslie Knope,"Good answer, great body."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, what do we do?"
Leslie Knope,"He put a lot of people out of work, he had tons of mistresses, he polluted this town."
Leslie Knope,"However, he was a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"However, he is a man, and he died."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"But that man is 98 years old, and he's an awful man."
Leslie Knope,I'm never going to get away from these Nick Newport questions.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, for once, this is not about you."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can we talk for a second?"
Leslie Knope,Why don't you play with the real one?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,I had to try.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann, but where was that advice six hours ago?"
Leslie Knope,I'm no better than her.
Leslie Knope,Jen is right.
Leslie Knope,And you know what?
Leslie Knope,"No, it's my fault."
Leslie Knope,"No melon, no apples."
Leslie Knope,And it is very classy.
Leslie Knope,"We brought a ""sorry for your loss"" fruit basket for Bobby."
Leslie Knope,Nice.
Leslie Knope,We wouldn't even think it.
Leslie Knope,"No way, that's not us."
Leslie Knope,"Hi Sorry, are we late?"
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,Go forward!
Leslie Knope,Back it up!
Leslie Knope,Back it up!
Leslie Knope,Turn around!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, why are there so many people here?"
Leslie Knope,Do we call somebody?
Leslie Knope,"Do we, like, release a statement?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, how do we leak this to the press?"
Leslie Knope,A man is dead.
Leslie Knope,You don't know us at all.
Leslie Knope,A man has died.
Leslie Knope,Here's the situation.
Leslie Knope,I need everyone to gather around me in order of how much I trust them.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here, look."
Leslie Knope,"I want better schools, I want cleaner streets, I want to expel the violent gangs of geese in Detweiler Square."
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I want.
Leslie Knope,What do we want for our city?
Leslie Knope,"I do not just think of you as just a gofer, but right now, I need you to get me a triple espresso with eight sugars."
Leslie Knope,"April, you are a very intelligent and savvy young woman."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you go too."
Leslie Knope,Take Donna with you.
Leslie Knope,I have total faith in you.
Leslie Knope,I really need their votes.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we worked really hard to get those seniors back on our side after that ramp debacle."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, buddy."
Leslie Knope,And I will finally eliminate this city's libraries!
Leslie Knope,"I didn't think he would come, but he made it."
Leslie Knope,And I can see in the crowd president Obama smiling at me.
Leslie Knope,And I can hear the sound of the applause when I take my oath.
Leslie Knope,"When I close my eyes, I can picture the flash of the cameras at my swearing in."
Leslie Knope,"I want this so bad, I can taste it."
Leslie Knope,We've come so far.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,We can talk about it.
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,We don't have to do it.
Leslie Knope,It's just an idea I had.
Leslie Knope,"And if we win, hopefully, it will be the home that Ben and I share forever."
Leslie Knope,This is going to be our home for the next 24 hours.
Leslie Knope,He made it.
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I tell ya, these geese don't give me no respect."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, emergency meeting."
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, he's a real jerk."
Leslie Knope,"No, guys."
Leslie Knope,"No, this is isn't the time."
Leslie Knope,I can read the sign.
Leslie Knope,It does.
Leslie Knope,And and together we can build a better Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,You don't need to read the whole thing.
Leslie Knope,Oof.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"No, my official statement is that is overall, a bummer."
Leslie Knope,it does say that.
Leslie Knope,I Sad.
Leslie Knope,""" Jpeg."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Walter, it does say that."
Leslie Knope,"You're right, but using basic logic and human intelligence, one can surmise that this is a link to an image."
Leslie Knope,This isn't what we wanted printed on the signs.
Leslie Knope,He died?
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, he's a real jerk, and if he thinks he can buy this election for his son, he's wrong."
Leslie Knope,Nick Newport has been intimidating and bullying and poisoning this town for years.
Leslie Knope,"And if elected, I promise to stop the Newports and Sweetums from blatantly dumping contaminants into the Pawnee river."
Leslie Knope,"Together, we can build a better Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,You deserve more.
Leslie Knope,Can I just show you something here?
Leslie Knope,"He and his father, Nick Newport were exploiting this city for their personal gain."
Leslie Knope,"When I was building parks, helping the community, and putting together the harvest festival, where was Bobby?"
Leslie Knope,No respect at all.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry your dad died, and I'm really, really sorry I called him a jerk."
Leslie Knope,Because my dream is dead.
Leslie Knope,"You know, my mom was a great athlete when she was a kid."
Leslie Knope,"And at the end of the year, I ran the 5,000 meters in this huge track event."
Leslie Knope,"It's his surp Crap, it was me."
Leslie Knope,I forgot to invite Jerry.
Leslie Knope,I'm not taking a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,Is this because I forgot to invite Jerry to his own birthday party?
Leslie Knope,"I have a prediction, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"By the end of the night, you are going to take a bite of Jerry's cake, which incidentally, we need to pick up on the way home, and you are gonna say, ""sabbatical, schmabbatical."
Leslie Knope,Leslie can do it all.
Leslie Knope,"She's the best, and I'm stupid."
Leslie Knope,I just I've been running for office the entire time we've been dating.
Leslie Knope,"Boy, that's disappointing."
Leslie Knope,How long was that?
Leslie Knope,I'm exhausted.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, someone was supposed to invite Jerry."
Leslie Knope,That was good.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Did I hit your boob?
Leslie Knope,"But you're thoughtful, and you're brilliant, and your ambiguous ethnic blend perfectly represents the dream of the American melting pot."
Leslie Knope,"I've said this to you before, and I know it makes you uncomfortable"
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,You did?
Leslie Knope,Italy?
Leslie Knope,What is this?
Leslie Knope,"It's not Bobby Newport who's going to beat me, it's Brandi Maxxxx, the porn star."
Leslie Knope,That's it.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Who was supposed to invite Jerry?
Leslie Knope,"April, when does Jerry arrive?"
Leslie Knope,What a relief.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Like normal people.
Leslie Knope,"I know it's an amazing opportunity, but in just a few minutes, all this craziness is going to be over, and I just want to have dinner with you."
Leslie Knope,I don't want you to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,And I realize this after speaking with my best friend and relationship advisor Ann Perkins from the department of health.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going to say this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, I'm so tired."
Leslie Knope,Go another eight seconds.
Leslie Knope,Let's get your hands back up.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We're just about to get our lives back.
Leslie Knope,Not only more jobs but better jobs.
Leslie Knope,"My hands, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, my hands."
Leslie Knope,I just did a phone interview while simultaneously decorating this house for Jerry's surprise party.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, Ann, I can't read it."
Leslie Knope,"Totally multitasking, totally on top of all of it."
Leslie Knope,"Crow for dinner tonight, Mr."
Leslie Knope,Swanson?
Leslie Knope,"Election results, Ann."
Leslie Knope,It would kill me if he left.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are locked and loaded."
Leslie Knope,Music is ready.
Leslie Knope,Slideshow is prepped.
Leslie Knope,They're in these round gloves.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, just hang on a second, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,"Just I'm going to go vote, just fulfill a lifelong dream of mine and achieve one of my all time happiest moments real quick, and then we will talk about it."
Leslie Knope,"Et cetera, et cetera."
Leslie Knope,You're not voting for yourself?
Leslie Knope,Crap on a catapult.
Leslie Knope,They're laughing at your joke.
Leslie Knope,They screwed up my campaign signs.
Leslie Knope,The reason why Bobby and I are appearing together is to send the message that everyone should get out and vote no matter who they're voting for.
Leslie Knope,This isn't a bagel.
Leslie Knope,Now I gotta deal with this.
Leslie Knope,"I've only slept nine hours over the past four days, so I'm right on the verge of a nervous breakdown."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I will, Ron."
Leslie Knope,And I shall do it with aplomb.
Leslie Knope,Could go either way.
Leslie Knope,Anything else?
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport and I are separated by a razor thin margin.
Leslie Knope,"I'm never against anyone getting a candy bar, but watch what happens when you vote for me."
Leslie Knope,"Once again, I have to object."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That's my story.
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"Win or lose, I bet you anything that your dad was proud of you."
Leslie Knope,"The campaign is over, and you finished."
Leslie Knope,"You finished this race, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,"She ran up to me, and she wrapped me up in this big hug, and she told me she had never been more proud of me."
Leslie Knope,But she wasn't.
Leslie Knope,And I thought that she was going to be really disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,And I finished dead last.
Leslie Knope,Then you have to press it again.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch it.
Leslie Knope,"No, there's no time."
Leslie Knope,Let's get going.
Leslie Knope,"You know, we'll mull it over, we'll look at it from every side."
Leslie Knope,We'll just talk about it.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Where the hell could he be?
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""yes?"
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, why did you call us in here?"
Leslie Knope,What were you talking about?
Leslie Knope,You have plenty of jeans.
Leslie Knope,What were you talking to Jen about?
Leslie Knope,"You need to write a tie speech for me, something about the poetic nature of democracy and how I'm going fight this thing from my prison cell"
Leslie Knope,What if I tie?
Leslie Knope,What about my speeches?
Leslie Knope,I feel like I'm forgetting something.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"There is a Parks emergency that only you can help us solve, so we need you to get out of the tub."
Leslie Knope,"So in junior high, I joined the track team to impress her, even though I hated it."
Leslie Knope,"In a few days, Dennis will reopen."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so happy, I want to shout it from the rooftops."
Leslie Knope,Oh
Leslie Knope,Because I thought you were making a huge mistake.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe Howard did that to you.
Leslie Knope,You should be angry.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what's up?"
Leslie Knope,I have driven Ann right into the belly of the douche.
Leslie Knope,My God.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I don't think you would be the right man for the job."
Leslie Knope,"She's thinking about having a baby, and she's considering you as a possible donor."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, Ann is not interviewing you for her blog."
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, douche!"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I get it."
Leslie Knope,Douche!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you cannot be serious."
Leslie Knope,You want to have a baby with the douche?
Leslie Knope,Back to the drawing board.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's not gonna work."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Gross.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think, you probably need to get back to the studio, play some fart jokes, make fun of some immigrants."
Leslie Knope,"Then you became a morning shockjock and created the sport ""taint ball""?"
Leslie Knope,How do I know that name?
Leslie Knope,I know that name.
Leslie Knope,The last guy is Howard Tuttleman.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all I need to do is just shoot one more person down and then I can buy some time and convince Ann to wait for her own Ben level soul mate."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,That son of a bitch is astute.
Leslie Knope,"I know you're frustrated with dating, and you think you're not gonna meet someone, but two years ago, I didn't think I would meet someone like Ben, and I did."
Leslie Knope,That was not me.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not going anywhere, and we are gonna debate soon, and I need to warn you, I know my stuff."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,So you should toughen up.
Leslie Knope,That girl is me as a ten-year-old.
Leslie Knope,"I tried to impose my dream on you, and that's wrong."
Leslie Knope,"I want you to be happy, you know? I guess I just didn't consider that you would take a different path than I did."
Leslie Knope,So that's something.
Leslie Knope,But they did invite me to participate in their topless Jello-lympics
Leslie Knope,Got dicey.
Leslie Knope,"And I am leaving, just like you're gonna leave Ann alone."
Leslie Knope,I'm just standing here.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do we have a meeting?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"There, happy?"
Leslie Knope,Rudy.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I will stand there for one second and say it, and then we're done."
Leslie Knope,This is about you talking about my friend.
Leslie Knope,This is not about me and my constituents!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I am a city councilwoman, so I am not gonna Jello wrestle."
Leslie Knope,So I need you to lay off.
Leslie Knope,"Look, she is a wonderful person, and she does not deserve this."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, look, I am here because I want you to stop talking about my friend's womb."
Leslie Knope,"God, how did you make that so fast?"
Leslie Knope,That was a farcical sound effect.
Leslie Knope,Rudy.
Leslie Knope,But I think you do need to take a little bit more time with this decision.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,I don't know where we stand on him now.
Leslie Knope,Or a hero.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so did Lance Armstrong, and he turned out to be a lying drug user."
Leslie Knope,I am excellent at bowling.
Leslie Knope,So did the Unabomber.
Leslie Knope,"Tragically, we are both heterosexual."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Because that is the only scenario that would make sense to me.
Leslie Knope,"If she were dating a guy for six weeks, and they decided to have a kid, I'd be like, ""Congratulations, Ann And Channing Tatum."""
Leslie Knope,And she has only been dating herself for six weeks.
Leslie Knope,Ann is giving up on love and deciding to have a baby with herself.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're definitely gonna find a wonderful guy who loves you and respects you and fills your home with multiethnic genius babies."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you know that I fully support any woman's decision especially a beautiful unicorn nurse like yourself in creating the family that she wants."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, today?"
Leslie Knope,I'll embarrass the both of you.
Leslie Knope,You're totally right.
Leslie Knope,I'm not obsessing.
Leslie Knope,I probably shouldn't come.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,I can do jumps.
Leslie Knope,"But I have to warn you, I'm very good at iceskating."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll do a double date: You and you, and me and Ben."
Leslie Knope,I think you should take yourself iceskating.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I have an idea for your blog."
Leslie Knope,But you are so brilliant and kind and stupid hot.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, Sewage Joe."
Leslie Knope,He is the gentleman who was fired for emailing a picture of his penis to every woman in city hall.
Leslie Knope,I know that I hate it when my doctor makes me wait.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, maybe you should check in on your patient."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there he is."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, how did you come up with these three names?"
Leslie Knope,"In this case, the body is Ann's, and the woman in charge of it is me."
Leslie Knope,I fully believe that a woman should be in charge of what happens to her body.
Leslie Knope,"If I don't slow this baby train down, Ann may end up having a baby with some random weirdo instead of her soul mate."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I will institute a reduction in taxes For the small business owner as well as a 7% surcharge on all nonlocal business related development.
Leslie Knope,Together we will build a better pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Well, my campaign has a little momentum, so we're trying to capitalize on that by doing a focus group."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you remember Joe Fantringham."
Leslie Knope,Some things are very helpful.
Leslie Knope,All the things make me feel a lot of feelings about myself.
Leslie Knope,You'd want to know him.
Leslie Knope,"You'd want to know his personality, his favorite season of Friends, whether or not he hates jazz hopefully, he does."
Leslie Knope,"I think, ideally, you'd want to know the guy, right?"
Leslie Knope,Sperm that is worthy of your perfect eggs does not grow on trees.
Leslie Knope,"Look, you're Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"Um, you don't want a demon baby."
Leslie Knope,Shall we?
Leslie Knope,"Did you hear that, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you are a donor here, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Other things are not so helpful.
Leslie Knope,Maybe employ a more methodical approach.
Leslie Knope,One that involves colorcoded binders.
Leslie Knope,I'm running for office because I want to improve the lives of the people that I love and the city that's the greatest city in the world.
Leslie Knope,We're having a video conference.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're on mine, Brett."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can you hear me?"
Leslie Knope,"This is the avian flu, or we call ""H5N1."""
Leslie Knope,"I graduated first in my class from Harvard Medical School, so I know what I'm talking about."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, my name is Donatella Breckinridge, M.D."
Leslie Knope,We go live now to St. Joseph's Medical Center for an update.
Leslie Knope,Avian flu has just hit the town of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Good evening, this is Channel 4 lead anchor Willow Tremaine, with breaking news."
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, what could be on this?"
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Newport, hello."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if everyone just follows my instructions, we will ace this test, and we will be done in 90 minutes."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit with the avian flu.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody open their binders, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"This is a simple one, guys."
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,Avian flu!
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,I'll take a milkshake.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're good."
Leslie Knope,This is real life.
Leslie Knope,What can we do for you?
Leslie Knope,"Nope, can't fly away."
Leslie Knope,Maybe this is a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt.
Leslie Knope,This is a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"No, this is bad news."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Can you us an idea how long this is gonna take?
Leslie Knope,"I got to say, Leonard, it kind of feels like you're putting us through the ringer here."
Leslie Knope,Fix it!
Leslie Knope,"Fix it, Ben!"
Leslie Knope,Let me tell him something important.
Leslie Knope,And then to but I'm talking to someone important.
Leslie Knope,To set up triage at the high school
Leslie Knope,"Okay, tell the firefighters"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this drill will never end."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me care
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's what you do."
Leslie Knope,"You know we want people to come, right?"
Leslie Knope,I need everyone there at Animal Control to eradicate all the infected birds in town.
Leslie Knope,On television?
Leslie Knope,Ron who?
Leslie Knope,How are you?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, well, this simulated disaster is a total disaster."
Leslie Knope,No one.
Leslie Knope,I should've had animal control kill you.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,This is highly irregular.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's forget we ever talked."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, just pretend."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson?
Leslie Knope,"The most important event that I have ever organized in my entire life is happening in eight hours, and I am stuck in this room."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Just give me a hint as to which way you guys are leaning.
Leslie Knope,Paunch Burger's number one selling burger is the greasy lard bomb.
Leslie Knope,I'm not editorializing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the planning commission has a week to decide if they want a beautiful, innovative community park or a bunch of greasy lard bombs."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"No, there wasn't."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"""Dynamite"" stands for daring, youth friendly, natural, amazing, merry, inviting, tourist attractiony, and ecofriendly."
Leslie Knope,"If I could sum up the Pawnee Commons in one word, it would be: Dynamite."
Leslie Knope,I wanted that back.
Leslie Knope,That's mine.
Leslie Knope,Why would we do that?
Leslie Knope,"No, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,But I was dead wrong.
Leslie Knope,Bobby.
Leslie Knope,I thought that I could not love you any more than I already did.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question? Why are you even running for office?
Leslie Knope,Let's make a baby together.
Leslie Knope,We're in it now.
Leslie Knope,"You ready, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"What can I tell you? Besides, what is more cuter-us than your uterus?"
Leslie Knope,The Knope way involves a lot of uterine cartoons.
Leslie Knope,Hey! What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna quit the campaign.
Leslie Knope,You know my plan is better for the community.
Leslie Knope,"What are we going to do, guys?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we used your own ad, so I don't think it was mean."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your mother."
Leslie Knope,"And this year, we are more than prepared for your test, but, um, it just so happens, today is a little inconvenient."
Leslie Knope,I am the Pawnee Emergency Czar.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee has failed On last year's report, they stated, ""Every time it so much as drizzles in Pawnee, ""the town is in danger of collapsing into Thunderdome style, postapocalyptic mayhem."""
Leslie Knope,Each year every city in Indiana is reviewed by the Department of Emergency Preparedness.
Leslie Knope,The disaster preparedness people picked today?
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,Stop running the ad?
Leslie Knope,What's the emergency?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Donna, Jerry"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Leslie Knope,"I get it, and I love it, but I don't have time for food puns right now."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need you to contact three more food vendors on this list, and they need to do it for free."
Leslie Knope,But your applause is premature.
Leslie Knope,Give yourselves a hand.
Leslie Knope,I just want to say thank you for all your hard work this week.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,You are a genius.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and people could donate, or they could bid to put their names on everything in the park, like benches, cobblestones, trees, ants, air."
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I want is to be married to you and to somehow get 50,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,I don't want any of this stuff.
Leslie Knope,I don't want a citrus reamer.
Leslie Knope,How are we going to get that money?
Leslie Knope,I'm just reminding myself to tell Ron to tell you how good I am at bowling.
Leslie Knope,Each one more beautiful than the other.
Leslie Knope,"Now I have two best friends, Ann and Ann."
Leslie Knope,I wonder if mini golf is open.
Leslie Knope,Her name's Ann.
Leslie Knope,You know her name.
Leslie Knope,Her name's Ann.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,It's Mark.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look."
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thanks, rich."
Leslie Knope,Just let me focus up on this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, here."
Leslie Knope,Smile.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you'll get your picture the pawnee journal.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have to figure out how this works."
Leslie Knope,Black is what you wear on a stakeout.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you know, I feel very, you know, casual, relaxed."
Leslie Knope,Wear black.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Take this.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes."
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I did."
Leslie Knope,"""I don't need your business here."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And maybe you could tell us what you've seen.
Leslie Knope,We're trying to catch the guy.
Leslie Knope,So why don't you come to the van and help us?
Leslie Knope,"Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,"Right, I know."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's our community garden."
Leslie Knope,Quietly.
Leslie Knope,Come here.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Andy is the kingpin.
Leslie Knope,"We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, ""No, sir, Mark Brendanawicz."""
Leslie Knope,That is Andy.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, white male, light brown hair."
Leslie Knope,Write this down.
Leslie Knope,It's the kingpin!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, did you hear that noise?"
Leslie Knope,What about Barack Obama?
Leslie Knope,Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?
Leslie Knope,"But you were conceived in Libya, right?"
Leslie Knope,But you moved to South Carolina from where?
Leslie Knope,"Bucket drum, bucket drum You're not from here, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Shovel guitar, shovel guitar Somebody wants to play shovel guitar"
Leslie Knope,Get down.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, it looks like Andy."
Leslie Knope,You should be wearing something like this.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here."
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,"And by the end of the night, he will be mine."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, ""thar"" she bowls."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.
Leslie Knope,I felt like I was floating.
Leslie Knope,You wanna bowl?
Leslie Knope,"It was kind of indescribable, actually."
Leslie Knope,You wanna bowl together?
Leslie Knope,"You wanna be, like, bowl buddies?"
Leslie Knope,It was intense.
Leslie Knope,At a party in college.
Leslie Knope,I ate a brownie once.
Leslie Knope,"I'll just say hi to him, shake his hand, buy a him a few beers, share a few laughs, bowl a few frames, lose intentionally to make him feel good, friend him on Facebook."
Leslie Knope,"Great, just a casual game, you know?"
Leslie Knope,No biggie.
Leslie Knope,Who is this kingpin?
Leslie Knope,Who is this person?
Leslie Knope,We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Leslie Knope,"And listen, if this thing blows up, I was never here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just I'm just being cas."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And we never will if this gets out.
Leslie Knope,What are you rocking?
Leslie Knope,A 15 pounder?
Leslie Knope,"I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana."
Leslie Knope,I'll treat him just like everybody else.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hear you."
Leslie Knope,It was just an insanely good brownie.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Tommy Hilfiger?
Leslie Knope,Are you going to wear that shirt?
Leslie Knope,"And look, I put our faces on there."
Leslie Knope,It's mostly Sting.
Leslie Knope,It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
Leslie Knope,And I made us a mix CD.
Leslie Knope,It's like we're real police.
Leslie Knope,And candy necklaces.
Leslie Knope,Gorp.
Leslie Knope,Cameras.
Leslie Knope,Shakable whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I wouldn't know."
Leslie Knope,"We have notepads, pencils and pencil case."
Leslie Knope,I'm never on the other side of the glass with those things.
Leslie Knope,This is stuff that we're probably going to need.
Leslie Knope,I have stakeout supplies.
Leslie Knope,It's stakeout time.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,"Get the van, meet me at 7:00."
Leslie Knope,We got to catch this guy.
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs, Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone."""
Leslie Knope,I'm thinking about the big picture.
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to make the picture bigger by including this guy in it.
Leslie Knope,"I can't do anything about my gender or my height, but I can win that guy over with a fun round of bowling."
Leslie Knope,"Cause we flip the headline, and it's not ""Community Garden Infested With Pot."""
Leslie Knope,"You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal."
Leslie Knope,Ann is great.
Leslie Knope,"It is accurate about my opponent, it does not take"
Leslie Knope,And I bet she really misses you.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to need more of these if I'm going to stay up tonight.
Leslie Knope,which I am.
Leslie Knope,What? Is this your house? Where are we?
Leslie Knope,Don't-- Get your hands off that.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Mother Teresa, it's not your chocolate."
Leslie Knope,I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, prison changes a man."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.
Leslie Knope,That is so sexist.
Leslie Knope,It's just because I'm a woman.
Leslie Knope,"Would they deign to say such things to Woodrow Wilson or Benjamin Disraeli okay, I see what you're talking about."
Leslie Knope,"You know, you two go ahead."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Well, they're going to release him in a little while."
Leslie Knope,"Well, then maybe the campaign should host a bowling night."
Leslie Knope,It's been a very long night.
Leslie Knope,It would be laidback.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone having fun, great photo op."
Leslie Knope,My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
Leslie Knope,Also I'm really good at bowling.
Leslie Knope,I took the pictures.
Leslie Knope,"I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy."
Leslie Knope,"We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,Tom and I were in that van together.
Leslie Knope,"But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for the coat.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Huh, partner? Want to go get some breakfast?"
Leslie Knope,What a crazy night.
Leslie Knope,There actually was weed here
Leslie Knope,"No, I did not."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Duh! You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Leslie Knope,"Mm, yeah, that's really interesting stuff."
Leslie Knope,Why did that guy say that he wouldn't want to go bowling with me?
Leslie Knope,I've never been very good at letting things go.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"I swear to God, it actually-- It was there"
Leslie Knope,I can't tell you how many times a fun tugofwar with a dog over a chew toy turned contentious.
Leslie Knope,Just important that they're both in their homes--
Leslie Knope,And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.
Leslie Knope,One of us always ends up mad.
Leslie Knope,"I did some research too about the guy who said the thing about me and bowling, and his name is Derek."
Leslie Knope,"That's all that matters, you know? That Ann is home and she's okay."
Leslie Knope,I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.
Leslie Knope,It's down in the garden.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And we'll talk about the coat.
Leslie Knope,And get this he's not even that good of a bowler.
Leslie Knope,"His average is 132, according to the most recent available data."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,You're kidding.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look."
Leslie Knope,It's just--
Leslie Knope,What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,Do I look laidback?
Leslie Knope,Nobody.
Leslie Knope,I didn't say that.
Leslie Knope,How about now?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I forget now.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks for coming, man."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,She might be dating somebody else.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you guys aren't even dating anymore."
Leslie Knope,I don't really know how healthy that is.
Leslie Knope,"So, Andy, do you, like, spy on Ann from the pit?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,"You know, there's a string in there."
Leslie Knope,You want one?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's a necklace, made out of candy."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Leslie Knope,"Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Do I stutter?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Parks and Recreation.
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's right."
Leslie Knope,"If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors."
Leslie Knope,"I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner."
Leslie Knope,You really stepped in it.
Leslie Knope,"Hate to break it to you, Dave."
Leslie Knope,"Your name's Dave, right? Can I call you Dave?"
Leslie Knope,I'd like to come with you.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
Leslie Knope,Let me ask you a question.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it doesn't seem to matter to the police!"
Leslie Knope,"If you could just stop writing for a second, and just focus here, because--"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,Eight more hours?
Leslie Knope,I'm proud of it.
Leslie Knope,I don't care.
Leslie Knope,It's who
Leslie Knope,Do you like it?
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, stop laughing."
Leslie Knope,"I hate negative ads, and I would never do one in a million years."
Leslie Knope,She's stealing my jokes.
Leslie Knope,Those are my jokes.
Leslie Knope,That was my opener.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,It was nice to see you too.
Leslie Knope,That's how ready I am.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look, it has one."
Leslie Knope,It needs a Surgeon General's warning because it's so harmful to your health.
Leslie Knope,Those are stolen jokes!
Leslie Knope,"Uh, my speech doesn't need your luck."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you are our communications director."
Leslie Knope,Weigh in here.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'll pick Ann and Donna for my team."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I came prepared."
Leslie Knope,You can take Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you wanted to go negative."
Leslie Knope,"You got the biggest negative in the world, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Okay everybody I need big smiles from you We're making a positive ad here.
Leslie Knope,So just think of this as Christmas and your birthday and the first day of school all rolled up into one.
Leslie Knope,'Cause I'm about to open this on you.
Leslie Knope,Do you happen to have a can opener?
Leslie Knope,If it isn't Kim Terlando from the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to run an ad that highlights the good things about me, not the bad things about somebody else."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, well, well."
Leslie Knope,Totally dead.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I didn't want to tell you this, but Ann is having a hard time with it."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, no"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I forgot I did this."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Someone, [bleep] tell me what Neve Campbell sounds like."
Leslie Knope,What does Neve Campbell sound like?
Leslie Knope,"Like, I don't know, Neve Campbell?"
Leslie Knope,But I need to do someone that no one has heard before.
Leslie Knope,There's one.
Leslie Knope,"""I'ma Borat."""
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just do impressions.
Leslie Knope,The rest of you ugly nerds need to give me some jokes stat.
Leslie Knope,You've never had to compensate for anything.
Leslie Knope,She's kind of freaking out right now.
Leslie Knope,It's not your fault.
Leslie Knope,"Perkins, go."
Leslie Knope,"I need new material, and it needs to be great, and it needs to knock people on their butts, and it needs to transcend the genre of roast comedy."
Leslie Knope,And no dessert!
Leslie Knope,Go stand in the corner and think about what you've done.
Leslie Knope,Did anybody lose their copy?
Leslie Knope,She must have gotten a copy of my speech.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Kim told all my jokes, all of them."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, um, between you and me, I think that Donna is having a problem with going negative in the ad."
Leslie Knope,"I just opened up a can of ""whoop ass"" on myself!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,What am I gonna do?
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Donna."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you're too beautiful to be funny."
Leslie Knope,Positive is always better than negative.
Leslie Knope,"Barack Obama said, ""yes we can,"" and now he's president."
Leslie Knope,"Ben says, ""no we shouldn't,"" and now he's working for his girlfriend."
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna throw it away.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the busboy at our restaurant told us about a guy who we met in a parking lot, and then he had a backpack full of this stuff, and I'm just realizing now that it's not tea."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, we got you some very rare Hawaiian fertility tea, guaranteed to help you have a baby."
Leslie Knope,"Dark, rich, and full bodied."""
Leslie Knope,"Donna, we got you some coffee, because you said, and I quote, ""I like my coffee like I like my men."
Leslie Knope,"Um Chris, we got you an Acai tree because the Acai berry is a superfood."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have presents!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, it looked amazing, but it was closed."
Leslie Knope,It was amazing.
Leslie Knope,You know.
Leslie Knope,Then we went and visited Honolulu City Hall.
Leslie Knope,Theoretically.
Leslie Knope,We did not forget Jerry.
Leslie Knope,We saw the bus stop where a young Barack Obama used to sit and wait for the bus.
Leslie Knope,Even though they really can't handle their booze.
Leslie Knope,And I love my friends.
Leslie Knope,I love my job.
Leslie Knope,I love my husband.
Leslie Knope,"When you're in love, everything seems like a sign."
Leslie Knope,"But, truth be told, we just really wanted to get married."
Leslie Knope,There were a lot of signs that Ben and I miss you in the saddest fashion should get married tonight.
Leslie Knope,I love you and I like you.
Leslie Knope,You're all I need.
Leslie Knope,"The things that you have done for me, to help me, support me, surprise me, to make me happy, go above and beyond what any person deserves."
Leslie Knope,"Here's what I'll say, then."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the honeymoon was amazing."
Leslie Knope,"We got Jerry some earbuds, and a bag of peanuts, and the Skymall catalog."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,It's great to be here at the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I need double the smiles, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's take it back again.
Leslie Knope,And action.
Leslie Knope,And this is going great.
Leslie Knope,We're really positive.
Leslie Knope,"I think we're getting good stuff, right?"
Leslie Knope,What's it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,Do you think?
Leslie Knope,"That's not really a joke, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So I need you guys to pick up the slack.
Leslie Knope,"Ben is having his first day at work, so he cannot help me."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need more jokes, people."
Leslie Knope,It's all in good fun.
Leslie Knope,"Today, I take those burning coals, I shove them back down their throats, and I watch their melting flesh drip off their worthless faces!"
Leslie Knope,they rake me over the coals.
Leslie Knope,My number one target the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,It's an annual affair where the media and the government roast each other.
Leslie Knope,I am prepping for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
Leslie Knope,I think it's great for housebreaking puppies.
Leslie Knope,But I don't think it's useless.
Leslie Knope,Some people say that it's a useless tabloid.
Leslie Knope,I love the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,Also here are some reporters from the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,"There's so many wonderful, talented journalists here."
Leslie Knope,"""Whassup,"" Pawnee?"
Leslie Knope,Although maybe there's a copy of them in my office.
Leslie Knope,Um Borat.
Leslie Knope,They're giving me the light.
Leslie Knope,So use your money wisely.
Leslie Knope,"You may get a little heat for this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.
Leslie Knope,Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.
Leslie Knope,But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.
Leslie Knope,That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.
Leslie Knope,But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market."
Leslie Knope,"If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat."
Leslie Knope,I think I have a plan of how to save your store.
Leslie Knope,I'll just buy some red vines.
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am going to rent Finding Nemo."
Leslie Knope,Get popular films that people wanna see.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you're not helping."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody rent something, so we can help Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to help out Dennis and his business."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Well, we have to find a way to beat him."
Leslie Knope,"Get up, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's over."
Leslie Knope,And luckily Ben is going to announce the most amazing campaign strategy ever thought of in the entire history of western democracy.
Leslie Knope,"Go, Ben, here's your great idea."
Leslie Knope,We're all ready for it.
Leslie Knope,And start.
Leslie Knope,I'm running for office.
Leslie Knope,"This is the place where Perd Hapley shot his movie review show Lights, Camera, Perd."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, will you rent something?"
Leslie Knope,This is a Pawnee institution.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Reese Witherspoon.
Leslie Knope,We just told you.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna be running for city council.
Leslie Knope,This is not a blank check.
Leslie Knope,I'd call the police.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Fantringham, the city of Pawnee is not gonna give you a personal loan."
Leslie Knope,How did you get back in here?
Leslie Knope,"Bailiff, why is he back in here?"
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Videodome is receiving historical landmark status.
Leslie Knope,I think we scared him.
Leslie Knope,We're not bailing anyone out.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"Now, are there any more public comments before we vote?"
Leslie Knope,Like Pixar.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for your absurd opinion, which is shared by no one."
Leslie Knope,But I like the idea that there is a place where I could rent Rashomon.
Leslie Knope,"I haven't rented it, actually, yet."
Leslie Knope,A place where you can rent such films as Cinema Paradiso or Rashomon.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee needs a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art.
Leslie Knope,Please stop talking about wounded meat.
Leslie Knope,Are you hurt?
Leslie Knope,Are you lost?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing at a city council meeting?
Leslie Knope,Any other comments here before we Ron?
Leslie Knope,"And the point is also that the Pawnee Videodome is a place with tremendous community value, where people gather to expand their horizons."
Leslie Knope,Andy
Leslie Knope,"I know this is gonna hurt, but maybe some Michael Bay."
Leslie Knope,Bailiff!
Leslie Knope,I'm surrounded by my friends.
Leslie Knope,And we are here because I started a program to help local business.
Leslie Knope,My campaign manager and I are in love.
Leslie Knope,I have to do well at this press conference!
Leslie Knope,I keep getting emails all the time!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great, I got a new email about the parking lot at the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,I am a little embarrassed by that.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's Ben and my fantasy Lord Of The Rings pen pal letters."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm not embarrassed by that."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, nothing too bad so far."
Leslie Knope,This is an emergency.
Leslie Knope,"Can it, Unabomber."
Leslie Knope,I need to know what they might use against me.
Leslie Knope,"So I need to go through every email that I've ever sent, ever."
Leslie Knope,I have a press conference about the Pawnee Commons in two hours.
Leslie Knope,Donna!
Leslie Knope,"But it's very complicated, and it could take up to a month."
Leslie Knope,This is serious.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, quiet!"
Leslie Knope,I've been hacked!
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Sun hacked my email.
Leslie Knope,And Kim asked me if I liked the first season Army Wives just moments after Netflix did.
Leslie Knope,They asked me about the sewage eruption in Ramsett Park right after Ron emailed me about it.
Leslie Knope,They knew that Kernston's withdrew its sponsorship of the Commons before I even announced it.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Sun has been one step ahead of me for months.
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then how did Kim get the speech?"
Leslie Knope,Denied.
Leslie Knope,"So, uh, I did great."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the police said they're gonna launch an investigation to see whether or not I was hacked."
Leslie Knope,"Yay, it's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,"First, I'd like you all to check under your chairs."
Leslie Knope,I think you might be surprised and excited by what you find.
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee Videodome.
Leslie Knope,"Okay,Paths Of Glory it is."
Leslie Knope,This is exactly how I dreamed it would be when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,Like Finding Nemo or
Leslie Knope,Except I wasn't and my campaign manager was Mr. Belvedere
Leslie Knope,One that's a little bit more upbeat.
Leslie Knope,"Or we could, you know, maybe screen a different movie."
Leslie Knope,What a great party of five.
Leslie Knope,Neve Campbell.
Leslie Knope,You know who else is excited to be here?
Leslie Knope,I'm very excited to be here.
Leslie Knope,"Lucky for you, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,So I spent the whole night writing new ones.
Leslie Knope,"I would just like to point out that Kim Terlando stole all of my jokes for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, and they were great jokes."
Leslie Knope,But that is neither here nor there.
Leslie Knope,"It almost destroyed the franchise, according to my husband."
Leslie Knope,"Which, side-note, was a terrible movie."
Leslie Knope,Midi-chlorians are a fictional substance found in the blood of Jedi knights from the movie Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
Leslie Knope,I really thought you guys would gasp there.
Leslie Knope,"It's almost as serious as email hacking, which is what you have been doing to me for weeks."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we'll write an inspiring oped piece."
Leslie Knope,"It's very serious, Kim."
Leslie Knope,I would I would deny that report.
Leslie Knope,So not too shabby.
Leslie Knope,"The EPA has recently reviewed our soil samples, and they determined that we achieved, and I quote, ""Minimal acceptable standards."""
Leslie Knope,It's dirt.
Leslie Knope,Even better.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's my time."
Leslie Knope,"Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding."
Leslie Knope,But I don't have them with me today.
Leslie Knope,"Hoo, boy."
Leslie Knope,"You did, actually."
Leslie Knope,I'm really sorry I tackled you.
Leslie Knope,"It's just, I'd rather run the fake campaign ads that I made when I was ten than become negative and cynical."
Leslie Knope,And we just ordered 200 white chocolate top hats.
Leslie Knope,But we reserved a space for May 16th.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that makes it better."
Leslie Knope,And your parents aren't here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay But, wait, my mom isn't here."
Leslie Knope,Are we really doing this?
Leslie Knope,I wish we were getting married tonight.
Leslie Knope,This is the best night ever.
Leslie Knope,Have a good evening and be safe out there.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"From all of us here at Channel 4 News, I'm Jessica Rabrit."
Leslie Knope,It was a large one.
Leslie Knope,That's correct.
Leslie Knope,You need to get tougher.
Leslie Knope,You were pretty easy to take down.
Leslie Knope,5 on the Richter scale.
Leslie Knope,"That's right, Winnifred, the earthquake registered an 8."
Leslie Knope,"Isabella, can you tell us more about this killer earthquake?"
Leslie Knope,I'm here at the Pawnee Weather Center with celebrated geologist Isabella Winchester.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Jessica."
Leslie Knope,Winnifred?
Leslie Knope,"We go to our reporter, live, Winnifred Makepiece, for the story."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit by a devastating earthquake.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Breaking news, I've just been handed this."
Leslie Knope,It's under your name.
Leslie Knope,"Every time you say it, it just feels more right."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go over the duties right now."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, where are you?"
Leslie Knope,But I This is just it's just not the way I dreamed it would be.
Leslie Knope,The turtledove acknowledges!
Leslie Knope,Run!
Leslie Knope,"Ben, now go, run!"
Leslie Knope,"Wait, are you messing with me?"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it does."
Leslie Knope,"I want you to get everyone together, and meet me at Ann's house in ten minutes."
Leslie Knope,We can't look at each other!
Leslie Knope,I'm going to air a negative ad.
Leslie Knope,It's out of my hands now.
Leslie Knope,"But you know what, I'm actually feeling very zen about this."
Leslie Knope,"This is very bad luck, turn around."
Leslie Knope,We can't this is our wedding day.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no."
Leslie Knope,"You're either in or your out, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,This is really great.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, we're getting married tonight."
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, and I do not approve this message."
Leslie Knope,We have two hours to do this.
Leslie Knope,"God, I just hate the feeling of not being married to you."
Leslie Knope,I can't wait three more months.
Leslie Knope,I wish we were getting married tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just kick this up a notch?
Leslie Knope,And you know what?
Leslie Knope,Our top priority is now saving all the birds.
Leslie Knope,That's a risk we're gonna have to take.
Leslie Knope,"Chief Fugleberg, I want you to order your officers to find all the infected birds in the area and perform CPR."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you tell the hospital director to flush them down the toilet.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,I love Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And I want to make it even better.
Leslie Knope,"Better schools, safer streets, and a more progressive tax on residential properties."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit with A tornado quake!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, how much flu vaccine does the hospital still have?"
Leslie Knope,In order to save our park We have to destroy the entire town.
Leslie Knope,The only thing we can do.
Leslie Knope,"It is with a heavy heart that I say, ""We have been jammed."""
Leslie Knope,"Jamm invited Leonard here, and he screwed up the bus thing on purpose to slow us down."
Leslie Knope,The game is rigged.
Leslie Knope,Come here.
Leslie Knope,Guys!
Leslie Knope,I like dogs.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we already have a thousand views."
Leslie Knope,Are all state emergency drills this intensive?
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are making some changes to the Knope Protocol."
Leslie Knope,Bummer.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for your time.
Leslie Knope,I think we're done here.
Leslie Knope,This is the best night ever.
Leslie Knope,This is the best wedding present ever.
Leslie Knope,"Without further ado, the best band in Pawnee, Mouse Rat."
Leslie Knope,"It's a lesson that I have learned over and over again, but it bears repeating, No one achieves anything alone."
Leslie Knope,"And speaking of community, I'd like to thank my community, my friends."
Leslie Knope,"Every dollar spent here tonight by you, the community, will be poured right back into this wonderful project."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, if I could have everyone's attention please? I am so happy to announce that as of one minute ago, we have reached our fundraising goal."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and thanks for dressing up, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Let's start the gala.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,This is great.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,How did you get the word out?
Leslie Knope,"And more importantly, so will all of our more ample citizens."
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom, I love it."
Leslie Knope,You did all this? How did you get food?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I destroyed the entire town for nothing."
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna have to postpone the gala, but we can't, because the deadline is tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Nope, we don't have time for that."
Leslie Knope,Status report! Well
Leslie Knope,Status report.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, why is everyone standing around? We have work to do."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, so am I, so you can hear me! Ghost jammed!"
Leslie Knope,I'm a ghost.
Leslie Knope,I can't hear you.
Leslie Knope,"I will see everyone at the gala, and I will see you in hell."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're in charge of the dress and the hair and the makeup."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, the first draft of my vows, which I wrote the day after we got engaged, clocked in at around 70 pages."
Leslie Knope,"And I was thinking, like, the sensuality of Eleanor Roosevelt combined with the animal magnetism of Lesley Stahl."
Leslie Knope,"You know what, it seems like we're kind of evenly split."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"I'm pro parks, pro public safety, and I'm pro clean water."
Leslie Knope,"I'm also pro environmental regulation, and I'm very, very pro local propositions 45, 86, and 102F. But most of all, I'm pro Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Here are some other things that I'm pro.
Leslie Knope,"As you can see, I'm in favor of a lot of things, like hot dogs."
Leslie Knope,"Right, Charlie?"
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, the license, the rings, the officiant, everything?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, and I approve this message."
Leslie Knope,Do we even want to screen yours?
Leslie Knope,It is like the Ann Perkins of dresses.
Leslie Knope,It is the most beautiful object I have ever seen.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,I did it's implied.
Leslie Knope,I didn't we can just put it in.
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm Councilman Howser."
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks."
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks."
Leslie Knope,And all my dreams are coming true.
Leslie Knope,"And, in a half an hour, I am getting married over there to the most perfect man in the world."
Leslie Knope,I won fair and square.
Leslie Knope,It is over.
Leslie Knope,Why don't I call you a cab?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, enough."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,Name one thing that was wrong with it.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, everything going okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yay, the awesome one."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,Just makes the informational fliers look so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,When all the fluorescents are half-off.
Leslie Knope,I love the first floor of City Hall at night.
Leslie Knope,"It'll be good, 'cause I actually have some work I need to get started on."
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Fun.
Leslie Knope,We'll get married in May like we planned.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess it just wasn't meant to be, after all."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,End of discussion.
Leslie Knope,Where did you even get a stink bomb?
Leslie Knope,So I am not getting married without you there to walk me down the aisle.
Leslie Knope,Listen to me very carefully.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"I think that's exactly what you're supposed to do, if that mouth is attached to a drunk jerk face."
Leslie Knope,For what?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, good thing you're an orthodontist."
Leslie Knope,"What is this guy running for, president of being on every channel all the time?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're beautiful and you're organized."
Leslie Knope,"So in order not to bias anyone, these are the two ads that Ben and I made."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna pick one randomly, and we'll play that one first."
Leslie Knope,"I lost my father when I was ten, I don't have any brothers, and Ken Burns never wrote me back."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you have less than an hour."
Leslie Knope,"Designers, make it work."
Leslie Knope,There's always time.
Leslie Knope,"April and Andy, license duty."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ann, dress duty."
Leslie Knope,Kind of feels like this thing is falling apart.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we're having a few roadblocks here."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It needs to be signed by somebody at the City Clerk's Office.
Leslie Knope,"Wait a minute, hold on."
Leslie Knope,That's not very helpful.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,It's not over.
Leslie Knope,Squirrels and birds.
Leslie Knope,No time for verbs.
Leslie Knope,Now how did Cinderella finish her dress so fast?
Leslie Knope,It's never over.
Leslie Knope,This wedding is meant to be.
Leslie Knope,"If you're not gonna finish something three months early, then don't accept the job."
Leslie Knope,Why didn't the seamstress finish it?
Leslie Knope,It's not finished.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, break!"
Leslie Knope,I love all of you.
Leslie Knope,Bff.
Leslie Knope,I love you forever.
Leslie Knope,Let's say that we're all gonna meet back here in an hour.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, and, um, Jerry and Donna, I need you guys to just make sure that the gala runs smoothly."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm gonna need you to walk me down the aisle."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna figure it out.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Our friendship is over.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, I painted your garage pink."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what am I talking about?"
Leslie Knope,No time to do the Tim Gunn voice.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great, so I trust you, and make it work."
Leslie Knope,It's mean.
Leslie Knope,It's depressing.
Leslie Knope,It's awful.
Leslie Knope,"Or several dresses, 'cause I would love some options."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, please, tell me that you have sewn a new dress from scratch."
Leslie Knope,"Oh my God, we're running out of time."
Leslie Knope,Li'l Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna pull this wedding off.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna do this.
Leslie Knope,"""I am Ben Wyatt, and I want to destroy Leslie's dreams."""
Leslie Knope,"This is Li'l Sebastian, and this is a sign."
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, you."
Leslie Knope,"I don't understand, this is impossible."
Leslie Knope,It's him.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
Leslie Knope,"This idea felt so right, but maybe it's just too crazy."
Leslie Knope,"No rings, no license, no dress."
Leslie Knope,Did you find the rings?
Leslie Knope,There's your butt.
Leslie Knope,Falcon?
Leslie Knope,Falcon?
Leslie Knope,Now I think it is time for us to take a vote.
Leslie Knope,So who's in favor of Ben's ad?
Leslie Knope,Traitors!
Leslie Knope,I think we should keep debating.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, hey, good for you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there they are."
Leslie Knope,I just ordered some wings for us.
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,"He's a snake, I'm telling you."
Leslie Knope,"Our dispute aside, you should be careful with Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I missed it?
Leslie Knope,Why are you talking to Councilman Jamm?
Leslie Knope,The heavy handedness.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,He's my date.
Leslie Knope,George Gernway.
Leslie Knope,He's the City Manager in Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,I love this show.
Leslie Knope,Aren't you supposed to be a sheep?
Leslie Knope,What is that supposed to mean?
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think Pawnee needs an amazing arts program."
Leslie Knope,I think we should do more stuff like this.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, band!"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry that I missed your songs.
Leslie Knope,Is there any way that you guys could do like an encore or something?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Orin."
Leslie Knope,I see that now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you should just drop everything and coordinate it.
Leslie Knope,"I like the statement it's making that, you know, we're all in cages in a way."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shut up."
Leslie Knope,Boo.
Leslie Knope,How else do people enjoy things?
Leslie Knope,"I just said, ""let's get to work."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's get to work."
Leslie Knope,And perkinsed.
Leslie Knope,And ludgated.
Leslie Knope,You just got knoped.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Leslie Knope,"And, if you plow through and ignore us, this is gonna be your life."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, we just need a little bit more time to design our park."
Leslie Knope,They all needed a place to play.
Leslie Knope,"The dogs are here because there's no dog park in your neighborhood, and the kids are here because there's no human park in your area."
Leslie Knope,Boo.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I love you very much.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very, very sorry."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I ever wanted was for you to show the enthusiasm you showed for your dog park, and, when you did, I blew it."
Leslie Knope,I don't eat mice.
Leslie Knope,So now I'm a snake?
Leslie Knope,I told you that Jamm was a snake.
Leslie Knope,I hate when he says that.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it sounds like there's considerable opposition to this, so I'm sorry, Ms. Ludgate, you should go now."
Leslie Knope,"It's very uncool, but it's not illegal, technically, but it is a dick move."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is really, really cool."
Leslie Knope,"But what if this person, this Ricky, who is real, doesn't like waffles or anything."
Leslie Knope,"No, don't leave."
Leslie Knope,lots of natural light.
Leslie Knope,"It just has a really good energy here, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think any of the four previous locations would work, but there's something about this place."
Leslie Knope,Good girl.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, cheese."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't that sound fun?
Leslie Knope,"What we are gonna do is we're gonna take your enthusiasm, we're gonna bundle it up, and we're gonna find a new place for a dog park."
Leslie Knope,"I've been doing slow, painstaking work so I don't want to whip out the legalese on you now, but I got dibs."
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, April, that lot is mine."
Leslie Knope,I've been trying to put a park there for four years.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, this is a great place for a dog park."
Leslie Knope,You should not be friends with him.
Leslie Knope,"If you do want to be taken seriously, you might want to think a little bit about how you present yourself."
Leslie Knope,One tiny critique.
Leslie Knope,Home.
Leslie Knope,It's been a really crappy night.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe my mom tried to set me up with an 80 year old man.
Leslie Knope,And here we go.
Leslie Knope,I went to dinner tonight with somebody's grandpa.
Leslie Knope,Hey! Congratulations are in order.
Leslie Knope,I heard that you got that speed bump thing through.
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about? That thing was a pain in the butt.
Leslie Knope,You fixed a problem.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, that's horrifying, and so is Orin."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, there's already a dog here."
Leslie Knope,"April, please, I beg of you, I will do anything to keep you from doing that."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I thought they were friendship waffles.
Leslie Knope,I just got here.
Leslie Knope,Those were distraction waffles?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, people still refer to Mulch Ado About Nothing."
Leslie Knope,That soil brochure was not busy work.
Leslie Knope,How did you used to slow me down when I was becoming too meish?
Leslie Knope,Here's my question.
Leslie Knope,"He's smart, and he's beautiful, and I think of him in many ways as a daughter, but that would be crazy 'cause he's a man and his name's Ricky."
Leslie Knope,"He used to be a slacker, but now he's realizing his full potential, but at what cost?"
Leslie Knope,He's new.
Leslie Knope,Ricky Jordache.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am trying to remove parking meters, and there is a guy in Public Works who's being a real thorn about it."
Leslie Knope,I don't have time for a history lesson.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for agreeing to see me."
Leslie Knope,"God, he's good."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Joe."
Leslie Knope,George.
Leslie Knope,George!
Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie, look into my eyes, take a deep breath, and everything will be fine."
Leslie Knope,"What do I do, Joe?"
Leslie Knope,And now I need to destroy her.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It was nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,I have created a monster.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,They're my favorite rock group.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I am so proud of her, I could cry."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Do not blame me for the sins of my mother.
Leslie Knope,Recognize any of your ancestors among the meanies?
Leslie Knope,"June, 1817, the richest among them take all of their money from the bank and then flee up the hill like cowards to form Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,Uh
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"A scrappy group of frontiersmen and women arrive at a hardscrabble chunk of land and call it Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Mom."
Leslie Knope,He thinks we're on a date.
Leslie Knope,Did you tell him we were on a date?
Leslie Knope,"Well, neither is he."
Leslie Knope,And he's 62 years old.
Leslie Knope,"May, 1817."
Leslie Knope,Oh running away so soon.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That does make me feel better.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, how are you?"
Leslie Knope,I don't trust that guy for a second.
Leslie Knope,An entire town claimed they weren't home.
Leslie Knope,"We asked Eagleton for help, and they claimed they weren't home."
Leslie Knope,"In 1988, we were hit by a tornado."
Leslie Knope,No one from Eagleton has ever wanted to help anyone from Pawnee for any reason.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,You're like a Southern belle when Rhett Butler comes around.
Leslie Knope,Why are you so charmed by him?
Leslie Knope,Why would a fancy Eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny Pawnee park?
Leslie Knope,Can we just cut to the chase here?
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,We totally fixed it.
Leslie Knope,Typical.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look who's paying attention to me now!"
Leslie Knope,My mouth is dry.
Leslie Knope,My mouth is kinda dry.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,That's not what I want to say.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"I may have allowed my prejudices, my totally legitimate prejudices against Eagleton affect my feelings towards your involvement in this project, and so therefore, I would like to say that I'm I'm I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Now, you know that we're gonna be building a park on a residential lot, so, of course we're gonna have to get the zoning codes approved and amended by our city council."
Leslie Knope,I don't want to.
Leslie Knope,I am never going to apologize to someone from Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Uh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, documentaries, political thrillers."
Leslie Knope,"You know, say what you want about Pawneeans, but we never give up."
Leslie Knope,"You are a laugh riot, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Or Lord Voldemort.
Leslie Knope,"So, I brought some pictures of the lot, and you can tell that the houses are very close to it."
Leslie Knope,How difficult is rezoning in your town?
Leslie Knope,Idi Amin.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Could you go into detail a little bit about that?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you have to have zoning codes, or else the whole thing could be chaos."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I've been focusing on my career.
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?
Leslie Knope,Ha ha ha.
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee side of our border with Eagleton And this is the Eagleton side.
Leslie Knope,Terrific.
Leslie Knope,"So, did you give any more thought to those zoning code questions I asked you?"
Leslie Knope,Perfectly manicured shrubbery.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful fountain.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we have not received one usable idea so far."
Leslie Knope,I'm getting kind of worried.
Leslie Knope,"Please find me a lawyer."""
Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm innocent."
Leslie Knope,"""Here's a model of what I thought the park could look like."
Leslie Knope,"All right, so this is a letter from what looks like a federal penitentiary."
Leslie Knope,"""Now it's time for 'Jazz Plus Jazz Equals Jazz, ' ""today we have a recording of Benny Goodman played over a separate recording of Miles Davis."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,This is all gonna fall apart if you don't hurry.
Leslie Knope,This is like Parks Department porn.
Leslie Knope,Hurry.
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, send in your plan or your resume And quick."
Leslie Knope,This park is going to be a celebration of Pawnee by Pawnee and for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Well put.
Leslie Knope,That's correct.
Leslie Knope,You already asked me that.
Leslie Knope,So I guess I'm here to send out the Bat Signal.
Leslie Knope,"Derry, my team and I are trying to build a park, and we need input on the design from you, the citizens of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Your show last week on dolphin lactation was just riveting radio.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"My friend Andy is playing in a band tonight, and I kind of wanted to go."
Leslie Knope,"It is a pleasure to be back, Derry."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,This guy is great.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if he's some junkie war criminal pimp.
Leslie Knope,I am not gonna change my mind.
Leslie Knope,"Well, they always wine and dine you first, but the fact of the matter is Eagletonians are, without exception, snobby, condescending jerks."
Leslie Knope,Just you wait.
Leslie Knope,He seems cool.
Leslie Knope,It's so boring.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,"What am I supposed to do with my garbage, just throw it on the ground?"
Leslie Knope,There's no trash cans anywhere.
Leslie Knope,And a little inconvenient.
Leslie Knope,"In a word, underwhelming."
Leslie Knope,Eh.
Leslie Knope,What a dump.
Leslie Knope,He designed this place?
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's a great place for a business meeting.
Leslie Knope,I like your plan.
Leslie Knope,Then we can reject him face to face.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,We have had a blood feud that has lasted for 200 years.
Leslie Knope,We cannot have someone from Eagleton design a park for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes when I rant about Eagleton, I forget to breathe, and I pass out."
Leslie Knope,"God, that was close."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not being melodramatic when I say that people from Eagleton are snobby and evil, and they look down on Pawnee, and they would most likely exterminate everyone who isn't from Eagleton if they weren't so busy being obsessed with themselves."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I've changed my mind."
Leslie Knope,Are you sure?
Leslie Knope,This is Canada Dry.
Leslie Knope,That's what we're supposed to do.
Leslie Knope,Like we connected that night when we made love five years ago.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Great attitude, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so the Valentine's Day dance is planned, prepped, and under budget, but we have one final task."
Leslie Knope,"Ann Perkins is currently attending the Valentine's Day dance alone, so I need each one of you to bring an eligible bachelor for her tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Because that's what friends do, April."
Leslie Knope,They help friends find happiness.
Leslie Knope,"Now the last guy she liked was Chris, but she can't date him again because he's her boss."
Leslie Knope,"So when we're thinking of prospective sweethearts, we need to think of people who are Attractive and smart and kind."
Leslie Knope,"And if you're wondering what kind of guy is right for Ann, all you need to do is ask."
Leslie Knope,"Also you need to find someone educated, and friendly, and fun"
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ox, for keeping this ship afloat."
Leslie Knope,"Effervescent, he needs to be effervescent."
Leslie Knope,Love you.
Leslie Knope,No one respond.
Leslie Knope,Silence.
Leslie Knope,"You are a beautiful, talented, brilliant, powerful musk ox."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you are such a good friend."
Leslie Knope,"Everything is terrible, but I am going to fix it with my secret weapon."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, slight speed bump."
Leslie Knope,"Great, like what?"
Leslie Knope,Help me make this work.
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to be here now, with you and your parents."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are off to a rocky start, but we are gonna fix this."
Leslie Knope,Yachter Otter?
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Red Vines anyone?"
Leslie Knope,No one say anything.
Leslie Knope,"Two months ago, I have a dream about a playboy otter lost at sea, and you make him real?"
Leslie Knope,I will find you love.
Leslie Knope,"Steve, you like sailing, right?"
Leslie Knope,I will make an Ulani square.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're not technically"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom."
Leslie Knope,"It represents our two families coming together, and there is a personalized square for each member of our joint family, see?"
Leslie Knope,The Knope Wyatt unity quilt!
Leslie Knope,Voila!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, I have a surprise for all of you."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"And mom, how's it going with Steven?"
Leslie Knope,"La, la, la, la, la, la, la."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you beautiful spinster."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, can you start talking?"
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Right [Bleep] now.
Leslie Knope,"In ninth grade, a quilt ended an argument between my two best friends, and a quilt settled the Donna Jerry parking lot feud of 2006."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I put you on the spot when I asked you about your love life."
Leslie Knope,How are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, on three separate occasions, I have used a quilt to mend fences."
Leslie Knope,"There's a surprise for you, so, um, head on in."
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise that there she goes.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you head in the other room?
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about something other than sailing.
Leslie Knope,"Yech, no thankee."
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least you don't have to deal with all that boat upkeep now, right, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,We're so happy that you're here.
Leslie Knope,What a wonderful surprise.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,The Knope Wyatt unity quilt.
Leslie Knope,"We make some small talk, and 30 minutes later, I show everybody the big surprise."
Leslie Knope,"Then later, Stephen Wyatt shows up that's your dad."
Leslie Knope,What a fabulous coincidence.
Leslie Knope,"We hand her a glass of chilled white wine, and, oh, look, my mom is walking over, and they're both educators and mothers."
Leslie Knope,Your mom arrives at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Let's go over the plan.
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"I know you're scared, but I love you, and this party is gonna go great."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna have to get used to that.
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are weaving our lives together, so I have woven this quilt."
Leslie Knope,We are a Red Vines family.
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Leslie Knope,"Put him down as a ""maybe."""
Leslie Knope,That's his style.
Leslie Knope,"Well, he kind of waits until the last minute."
Leslie Knope,Has you know who responded yet?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tminus six hours until the engagement party."
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,And you're hearing about it for the very first time right now.
Leslie Knope,Ben and I are engaged
Leslie Knope,We have something very exciting to tell you that you have never heard before.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, everyone!"
Leslie Knope,"No to canceling the party, and no to Twizzlers."
Leslie Knope,It represents every member of our new united family.
Leslie Knope,"Of all my metaphorical art projects, this is by far the coziest."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Ulani, hi, I'm Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I thought we had agreed that we weren't gonna get each other presents because we were too busy with the campaign I got you something too.
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't supposed to bring his girlfriend, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"It is a cryptex, like in that movie The Da Vinci Code, which was the first movie that you and I ever watched on Starz HD."
Leslie Knope,He brought his girlfriend?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So far, so good."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thank you."
Leslie Knope,Inside it will tell you where to meet me at 9:00 P.M.
Leslie Knope,"tonight, and the combination is a fiveletter code that captures the essence of our third date."
Leslie Knope,Yeah So I will see you tonight.
Leslie Knope,Unless You can't crack the code.
Leslie Knope,"And I said, rules or no rules, I just have to kiss that beautiful face."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Right this way.
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I have some white wine for you, some Chardonnay."
Leslie Knope,Wyatt.
Leslie Knope,"It'sit's really nice to finally meet you, Ms."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I need you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, your mom's here."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, this quilt is going to unite the Wyatt clan."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, that's just a little one."
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,"And, out of respect, I did not include any images of the only other man in the world who's as sexy as you, Joe Biden."
Leslie Knope,I worked really hard on it.
Leslie Knope,"Very, very easy."
Leslie Knope,Mark and I are really connecting tonight.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"What does ""Ulani"" mean?"
Leslie Knope,And I just want to say thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I will."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. vice president, I am deeply flattered, but there's no way that I could take over Madam Secretary Clinton's position."
Leslie Knope,This isn't real.
Leslie Knope,This isn't happening.
Leslie Knope,You're my name just came out of your mouth.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this pit."
Leslie Knope,Give it to me straight.
Leslie Knope,Are we ever gonna turn it into a park?
Leslie Knope,"But, seriously, I mean, really?"
Leslie Knope,Screw it.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna try to do it anyway.
Leslie Knope,You're very handsome.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, Kennedy put a man on the moon."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, that how did How did you do this?"
Leslie Knope,Is it a waffle tower?
Leslie Knope,How could I pass up an opportunity to look at our future house?
Leslie Knope,I really admire you.
Leslie Knope,You can be the first gentleman.
Leslie Knope,You take the East Wing.
Leslie Knope,I'll take the West Wing.
Leslie Knope,"I win, we move in there."
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,2020
Leslie Knope,We're gonna make out so hard in the back of your cab.
Leslie Knope,I can build one park.
Leslie Knope,"Get ready, driver."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope,"I recognized her potential a long time ago, and she's finally living up to it."
Leslie Knope,There's actually a lot of similarities between those two nights.
Leslie Knope,That time we were also at a bar.
Leslie Knope,And he was also pretty drunk.
Leslie Knope,"If you could put anything in the park, what would you put in there?"
Leslie Knope,Don't over-think it.
Leslie Knope,A picnic table?
Leslie Knope,April came to me with an idea to build a dog park in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"God, that sounds wonderful."
Leslie Knope,Now stand next to the screen and think about all the strong female role models in your life.
Leslie Knope,I am so proud of you.
Leslie Knope,"I want to take a picture of you saying ""per capita."""
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I would live in that park.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,What time is it? I should go.
Leslie Knope,He is precious cargo.
Leslie Knope,Where are we going? All the bars are closed.
Leslie Knope,"What? Mark, don't."
Leslie Knope,This pit isn't a dump.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so"
Leslie Knope,So far to the left! So far to the left!
Leslie Knope,"No, please."
Leslie Knope,I don't want anyone to see! I'm the Deputy Director of Parks
Leslie Knope,"You don't let anything happen to him, you understand me?"
Leslie Knope,We'll see you tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Can you say ""per capita"" again?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,"So technically, I am three for three with unity quilts."
Leslie Knope,"Also, for the record, my unity quilt worked."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's so brutal!"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, why don't we just forget about the quilt and just raise a glass?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, time for gifts."
Leslie Knope,"We have gift certificates for facials everybody, then you're gonna get a needlepoint pillow with your face on it and a news headline from a newspaper on the day you were born."
Leslie Knope,"That's right, Mom, and you replaced him."
Leslie Knope,It's working.
Leslie Knope,Though not in terms of genocide.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben, they're agreeing."
Leslie Knope,It's a unity quilt.
Leslie Knope,"Just in terms of, you know, being on earth."
Leslie Knope,It's not your it's everyone's quilt.
Leslie Knope,"February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance, but February 13th, galentine's day, is about celebrating lady friends."
Leslie Knope,Were you and Dad ever like that?
Leslie Knope,"It's wonderful, and it should be a national holiday."
Leslie Knope,All we had to do was
Leslie Knope,"Dear Congress, it's Leslie again."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about personal relationships.
Leslie Knope,It's that simple.
Leslie Knope,Who wants to start?
Leslie Knope,Unity!
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"April, you're the old married broad here."
Leslie Knope,How's Andy?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,It should be a national holiday.
Leslie Knope,La la la la la.
Leslie Knope,How can you be so wise and so inappropriate at the same time?
Leslie Knope,I grabbed all of the brownies from the dessert table and four bottles of wine.
Leslie Knope,I should keep an eye out for that.
Leslie Knope,I guess he might become insane as he ages.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what am I doing?"
Leslie Knope,This isn't the way I want this to happen again.
Leslie Knope,"I think you should go home, Mark."
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, it's"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Mark, are you all right?"
Leslie Knope,"Are you okay? Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,And that's all that matters.
Leslie Knope,He's amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Ben's parents are insane, but he is not."
Leslie Knope,You don't even have to socialize.
Leslie Knope,"I don't expect you to like each other, but you have to come to the wedding, okay? We'll seat you far away from each other."
Leslie Knope,So here is the new plan.
Leslie Knope,But it did not work out that way.
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,"Phase one of our new plan, you get in the backseat of this cab, and we hardcore make out for 15 minutes."
Leslie Knope,I agree.
Leslie Knope,It was a good quilt.
Leslie Knope,"I am on your team, but I think that our team should be far away from here."
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and I want to be on your team."
Leslie Knope,I am so sorry for everything.
Leslie Knope,We're going to Australia.
Leslie Knope,Get in the car.
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is your square now."
Leslie Knope,We're getting married!
Leslie Knope,Drink Canada Dry if your mouth is dry.
Leslie Knope,What I want to say is I'm s I'm sor I'm sor
Leslie Knope,All of them.
Leslie Knope,Man pigs.
Leslie Knope,Do they do that to me?
Leslie Knope,They don't do that to me.
Leslie Knope,That is horrible.
Leslie Knope,"Well, congratulations, man."
Leslie Knope,"Fun match, fun game, good times."
Leslie Knope,Did you have fun?
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, things aren't perfect."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am happy to report that it is now a pervert free people's club."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, technically, I'm not allowed to reserve this conference room without my husband or father's signature."
Leslie Knope,"You know what, I'm gonna get that commission going, because this inequality has gone on long enough."
Leslie Knope,"Women have come a long way in Pawnee, but we still have quite a ways to go."
Leslie Knope,Still going strong at 82.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you are such an inspiration."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we do."
Leslie Knope,"In the spirit of fair play, I suggest we put on these authentic Wamapoke headdresses and dance around the table."
Leslie Knope,It's amazing to watch.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,He really plays white people like a fiddle.
Leslie Knope,I would like to go on record and say that
Leslie Knope,There's something else.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, just one second."
Leslie Knope,"I'm running for city council, as you know, and uh, just wondering, do I have your vote?"
Leslie Knope,Paula Horke was Pawnee's first female city councilor a huge inspiration to me.
Leslie Knope,Derek.
Leslie Knope,She's kidding.
Leslie Knope,She ugh.
Leslie Knope,We have to be better.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I took extensive notes on ways to maximize our efficiency, because we can't be just as good as the men."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no?"
Leslie Knope,You need to hire more women.
Leslie Knope,"Garbage collectors make good wages, they have good benefits, and they are the smelly glue that keeps this city together."
Leslie Knope,"You have one woman, and she's a secretary."
Leslie Knope,"Why are there no female garbage collectors, Steve?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, stop celebrating."
Leslie Knope,The number one offender: Sanitation.
Leslie Knope,"Incoherent ramblings aside, I've done some research, and the female employment rate in government is abysmal."
Leslie Knope,Or your hip?
Leslie Knope,Is it possible you're thinking about light bulbs?
Leslie Knope,"April, stop it."
Leslie Knope,This is my commission!
Leslie Knope,"Well, Councilman Milton, I did put the snacks together, and they are delicious, I must say, but that is not the point."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, okay, we are gonna need to rebalance this commission."
Leslie Knope,Did anyone notice that there are no women on the Gender Equality Commission?
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,You're kidding me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,So the commission?
Leslie Knope,That's what you're calling her now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,I didn't know where you were going with that.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,You old soandso.
Leslie Knope,"For reals, can I count on your vote?"
Leslie Knope,"But we've been here bowling all night, and we've been having fun."
Leslie Knope,Shauna MalwaeTweep.
Leslie Knope,I called Tweep.
Leslie Knope,I tweeped.
Leslie Knope,Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I tried to exploit the Wamapoke for my own personal gain.
Leslie Knope,"Take extra cream, 30 sugars."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, please."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you got a spare."
Leslie Knope,That's so cute.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm so glad that you're here."
Leslie Knope,Check out the scoreboard.
Leslie Knope,"What a defeat, man."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I did not expect to win by that much."
Leslie Knope,"But I warned you, I am a good bowler."
Leslie Knope,"All joking aside, I wanna say that I actually had fun."
Leslie Knope,And I'm really looking forward to your vote in the spring.
Leslie Knope,Just ignore him.
Leslie Knope,He's being a jerk.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That was awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look."
Leslie Knope,Here's that photo op you wanted.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Derek."
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Nothing?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And you're still not gonna vote for me?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're a crappy bowler, and I pretended to lose to you."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's true."
Leslie Knope,I am a really good bowler.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,"I just hope that you can forgive me, Ken."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I'd love to.
Leslie Knope,"Tell you what, if I win, I get your vote."
Leslie Knope,And this isn't even about the Pawnee Commons.
Leslie Knope,I have great respect for the Wamapoke culture.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very, very sorry."
Leslie Knope,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,I wanted to delay construction on the Paunch Burger and buy some more time for my park project.
Leslie Knope,Those artifacts found at lot 48 were placed there by me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I want to raise the bar of awfulness so that when I confess something to you, you have perspective."
Leslie Knope,"In 1951, Pawnee made it illegal for people to, ""Dance or smell like a native American."""
Leslie Knope,"In 1921, several Wamapoke families were removed from their homes so that Pawnee could install a bumper car track."
Leslie Knope,Done.
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I'd like to introduce Derek's ass to my foot.
Leslie Knope,"You have turned into a very beautiful, wise, and fertile government employee."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, April, I wish you weren't right, but you are."
Leslie Knope,Why do I have to?
Leslie Knope,The zodiac killer never confessed.
Leslie Knope,He's gonna be so mad.
Leslie Knope,"April, I love you, but I don't need your sarcasm right now."
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
Leslie Knope,And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
Leslie Knope,We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.
Leslie Knope,"A community garden, right in the middle of the pit."
Leslie Knope,This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.
Leslie Knope,Or am I?
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm over it."
Leslie Knope,"You know, we slept together six years ago."
Leslie Knope,"But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex."
Leslie Knope,You make such good coffee.
Leslie Knope,Ovaries before brovaries.
Leslie Knope,And Tom is our master horticulturist.
Leslie Knope,Uteruses before duderuses.
Leslie Knope,You know my code.
Leslie Knope,As long as you and I are cool.
Leslie Knope,It's so fine.
Leslie Knope,Seriously.
Leslie Knope,Yeehaw!
Leslie Knope,"I'm so fine with it, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Man, move over, pins."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,There's a new Sheriff in town.
Leslie Knope,"You are so down with strikes, they should call you Norma Rae."
Leslie Knope,"Let me see, No, just trash."
Leslie Knope,Maybe there's something on the bottom here.
Leslie Knope,Hoes before bros.
Leslie Knope,It's filled with trash.
Leslie Knope,He knows all the scientific names for everything.
Leslie Knope,Like this.
Leslie Knope,You like wings?
Leslie Knope,That'll leak to the press.
Leslie Knope,Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Who knew?
Leslie Knope,I knew.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Leslie Knope,Did you check your voicemail?
Leslie Knope,"That's how I motivate myself, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Never good enough.
Leslie Knope,Let me get you a beer.
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,Did you see that I paged you?
Leslie Knope,Did you get my emails?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, dude."
Leslie Knope,It's my guilty pleasure.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, did you get my texts?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe some kind of spice?
Leslie Knope,"If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands."
Leslie Knope,"What do you think, carrots?"
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Leslie Knope,"Look, someone planted something new."
Leslie Knope,Growing beautifully.
Leslie Knope,And those over there?
Leslie Knope,"What's this, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,These beers are as cold as the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road.
Leslie Knope,And it's trash.
Leslie Knope,"And, best of all, April gave me this present to commemorate our feminist victory."
Leslie Knope,"Not only did we complete the garbage route and move an unmovable fridge, but the Sanitation department hired three new female trash haulers."
Leslie Knope,"You know, leave the earlier part on the record, but if we can't get this fridge onto the truck then maybe not put that on the record, and then just destroy the record altogether."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Shauna, maybe not put this part on the record."
Leslie Knope,Not at all.
Leslie Knope,"We are not leaving until this symbolic feminist obstacle is loaded onto that truck of women's advancement, and you can put that on the record, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,Let me tell you something.
Leslie Knope,"What, you think Joan of Arc needed a hand?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, we don't need a hand."
Leslie Knope,"On four, five, six, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, move it."
Leslie Knope,On three!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,I didn't mean to say that.
Leslie Knope,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,That's the covergirl slogan.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no."
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,We have some stereotypes to overcome.
Leslie Knope,"April, let's finish up!"
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Bring it on, Stevie boy."
Leslie Knope,A new challenge?
Leslie Knope,Let's move it out!
Leslie Knope,Google Earth Always taking pics.
Leslie Knope,Tough stuff.
Leslie Knope,"You know, with us being women and all, you'd think our boobs would get in the way."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's weird."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, easy, breezy, beautiful."
Leslie Knope,The whole city is watching.
Leslie Knope,"If I can't move that fridge onto that truck, then feminism is over in this town."
Leslie Knope,I don't know why I thought sneaking up on it would work.
Leslie Knope,"So do you think the soup kitchen could use that fridge? I mean, April and I were gonna haul it onto the truck effortlessly, but if you need it"
Leslie Knope,It's a Sally Field movie about Unions.
Leslie Knope,"I know you're not used to this, but maybe you should just try to keep it chill and see what happens."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's pretty good, right? ""Personal relationship."""
Leslie Knope,"The point is, you're really good at this."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, classic Derek with the Zings."
Leslie Knope,"Man, that's what bowling is all about hey."
Leslie Knope,Sir! Does this refrigerator still work?
Leslie Knope,It's going really good.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hold on."
Leslie Knope,Nobody can lift it.
Leslie Knope,"Um, we're just hanging out and having a very good time."
Leslie Knope,Just call it a tie.
Leslie Knope,You know what? Let's just go.
Leslie Knope,"I realize that, but I will knock down this pin, and then this pin will knock down all the other pins."
Leslie Knope,Those Sanitation goons set us up.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean they couldn't lift it?
Leslie Knope,"No, I understand animal sizes."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are."
Leslie Knope,"It was just such tasty, righteously flavored bait."
Leslie Knope,I should never have taken the bait.
Leslie Knope,Classic Derek.
Leslie Knope,"We have to solve this problem, or they are going to point to this forever as a reason to not hire women."
Leslie Knope,That's what's in the binder on every page because I believe in being thorough.
Leslie Knope,That's nothing.
Leslie Knope,I need your help.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, guys."
Leslie Knope,I respect your honesty.
Leslie Knope,"I know you didn't, but if you had gone to Hogwarts Academy, which House do you think you would have been?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that guy said he didn't like my earrings."
Leslie Knope,"What are your five biggest hopes, dreams, fears, and regrets?"
Leslie Knope,Go punch him.
Leslie Knope,"So tell me everything about yourself: Your kids, your hobbies."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's Ulysses."
Leslie Knope,"Ron has told me so much about you, in that he has told me your name is Diane, and you exist."
Leslie Knope,"Diane, wow."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,This is very exciting.
Leslie Knope,"We are at Saint Joseph's Medical Center because, today, Andy Dwyer is getting his casts off."
Leslie Knope,Gryffindor.
Leslie Knope,"It is a great day for Andy, and it's a wonderful day for my subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,"No, they're not."
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Jingle bells, jingle yay, jingle good for you"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I forgot to sing you my merry CongratuChristmas carol."
Leslie Knope,I am very excited to meet Diane.
Leslie Knope,Even better.
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't be there alone.
Leslie Knope,"Doctor, if I may, could I keep that cast, please?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"This is a symbol of new beginnings, a symbol of hope, and of our project."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you know, this is a big deal."
Leslie Knope,We will build this park!
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"As your selfappointed emotional guardian, it is my duty to love and support you."
Leslie Knope,Seeker on the Quidditch team.
Leslie Knope,"Smart, funny, independent, and sexy?"
Leslie Knope,And divorced twice.
Leslie Knope,"Alert alert, alert, alert."
Leslie Knope,[Bleep] me!
Leslie Knope,"I am so, so happy for him"
Leslie Knope,This could end up being the best night in Ron Swanson's life.
Leslie Knope,But that's what happened.
Leslie Knope,But you got it.
Leslie Knope,But you have it.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, you have my approval."
Leslie Knope,Let's take it down a notch.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but, you know, it's not the Super Bowl, guys."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, she's even putting up with all this stupid, boring woodworking stuff."
Leslie Knope,Which one is Ron's?
Leslie Knope,"She is at the bar right now ordering a Lagavulin, neat for you."
Leslie Knope,"So what's the point, right, Derek?"
Leslie Knope,She gets you.
Leslie Knope,See? So I'm not going to apologize.
Leslie Knope,"And if people won't vote for me because of that, well, there's nothing I can do about it."
Leslie Knope,But you should be warned.
Leslie Knope,"If you do not vote for me, my boyfriend might beat you up."
Leslie Knope,"Now if anyone has any questions about the issues facing our city, I'm right here."
Leslie Knope,She is perfect for you.
Leslie Knope,Because I'm giving you my 100% approval about Diane.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, guess why my thumbs are up."
Leslie Knope,More like Diane Sawyer.
Leslie Knope,Diane Lewis?
Leslie Knope,"Derek hates me, and I don't particularly like him."
Leslie Knope,I can't wait to go tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I love events!"
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I wanna go to that concert so bad, but I have to go to the meeting."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,"But I'll meet up with you guys after the tete-a-tete, I promise."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna set it on fire and watch it burn.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna drive to his house.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna find out where he lives.
Leslie Knope,I know what we're gonna do.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am gonna think about a revenge plan."
Leslie Knope,Any excuse to talk to Wreston.
Leslie Knope,They call their boogers Pawnee caviar.
Leslie Knope,"I told you that Eagletonians are awful, terrible people."
Leslie Knope,We can't.
Leslie Knope,You have five seconds to get out of here Or I will rip your throats out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,That's very nice of you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,It's too soon.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that I I'm sorry, very sorry, that I was rude."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,You can just just say I'm sor
Leslie Knope,You're a human being.
Leslie Knope,He's a human being.
Leslie Knope,Where's Wreston?
Leslie Knope,But I wanna go to the concert!
Leslie Knope,"This guy is important, and he has valuable information that could help us build a park."
Leslie Knope,You know how I love mixing work into my personal life.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my"
Leslie Knope,"I've had a ""Ron Swanson"" Google alert for seven years and it finally paid off."
Leslie Knope,"You, Ron Swanson, have been nominated for an award from the Indiana Fine Woodworking Association."
Leslie Knope,"Half ""Merry Christmas,"" half ""Congratulations,"" because I just received some news."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Merry CongratuChristmas!
Leslie Knope,He's in love with me.
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, everyone!"
Leslie Knope,Ann wants to say something.
Leslie Knope,Me.
Leslie Knope,I can't see myself fighting you on more than 60% of these ideas.
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's perfect."
Leslie Knope,"A Wamapoke themed playground Food trucks from local restaurants, Li'l Sebastian fountain."
Leslie Knope,Now we're even.
Leslie Knope,"Ha ha! Wreston, suck it."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee forever! You want a stupid tie? I'll give you a stupid tie.
Leslie Knope,"Revenge! Ha ha hal This is for Pawnee, you buttfaced pompous jerk! Whoo! I love you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"So, I would love to come to this thing."
Leslie Knope,When is it?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Tonight?
Leslie Knope,I can't go.
Leslie Knope,My mom set up this meeting.
Leslie Knope,It's like a political tete-a-tete with a local bigwig.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you guys."
Leslie Knope,Everything is done.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm was being sneaky, and then I tried to sneaky him back, and it turned to crummy, and I have to undo it."
Leslie Knope,They are totally done.
Leslie Knope,Can I speak with you for a moment?
Leslie Knope,Ohhh!
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if we could put that in a public park.
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think we are.
Leslie Knope,"But historically, Pawnee's relationship with the Wamapoke has been more Murdery."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the headline I would've gone with is ""no-strike-bowling bowler struck by Knope's striking beau."
Leslie Knope,Ken and I get along great.
Leslie Knope,"Ken Hotate is the leader of the Wamapoke people, and we are trying to get them involved in our Pawnee Commons project."
Leslie Knope,Nonstarter.
Leslie Knope,He does that sometimes.
Leslie Knope,This guy's funny.
Leslie Knope,He's funny.
Leslie Knope,What are you losers doing for your bachelor party?
Leslie Knope,Not today.
Leslie Knope,I got us into this mess because I was fixating on that guy.
Leslie Knope,But this is ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,I do need more whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,Ma'am.
Leslie Knope,Help.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,She's gotta be tired by now.
Leslie Knope,But I think I'm safe.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'd do anything for Ron even spend a whole night fighting his crazy ex-wife."
Leslie Knope,"That's Diane's job now, and she seems more than up to the task."
Leslie Knope,I think it's time to officially retire as Ron's emotional guardian.
Leslie Knope,I don't deserve it.
Leslie Knope,"Ha! You're too late! No! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, what the hell are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,"You know, when I say it out loud, it doesn't sound so bad."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I buried a bunch of Wamapoke artifacts in the dirt so that people would find them and have to stop developing at the site."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, can I speak with you privately?"
Leslie Knope,"Please, Mr. president, put your pants back on."
Leslie Knope,"Just take a few deep breaths, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood for historical nudity."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, Randy, I would like you to know that we will not be pressing charges."
Leslie Knope,And we're gonna have to stop now.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, the guy was being a total jerk."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"What Ben did was warranted and extremely awesome, by the way."
Leslie Knope,Did you write down how awesome it was?
Leslie Knope,What the hell?
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ann, not now."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is bad."
Leslie Knope,It would be terrible if that were to happen on this future Paunch Burger site.
Leslie Knope,"So we passed a law saying that if any sacred Wamapoke artifact is found on a development site, all construction must immediately stop."
Leslie Knope,"For almost 200 years, Pawnee repeatedly built factories, restaurants, and other stuff on land held sacred by the Wamapoke people."
Leslie Knope,Yet another piece of Wamapoke land plowed over by the white man.
Leslie Knope,"April's mini dog park, the Li'l Sebastian fountain, even the Wamapoke playground."
Leslie Knope,"I know, Ann, but everything's gonna disappear."
Leslie Knope,"My dream is dead, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Jamm is stealing this lot right out from under us.
Leslie Knope,"Well, four years of work down the drain, and I have a penis on my head."
Leslie Knope,We still have two weeks left.
Leslie Knope,"Look, the deal was that both of us had three months to get our proposals together, and then we put it up for a vote."
Leslie Knope,I should not have done this.
Leslie Knope,Come back here Ow! You are not gonna ruin this night!
Leslie Knope,No! No!
Leslie Knope,You are so crazy!
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow!"
Leslie Knope,She's not even here.
Leslie Knope,Tune her out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, this is your moment."
Leslie Knope,I'd like to first start by saying thank you for coming.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, this table is reserved."
Leslie Knope,"And on behalf of Ben Wyatt and everyone involved in my campaign, I'm very sorry for what happened at the rock n' roll bowling alley last night."
Leslie Knope,"You know what? No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sorry.
Leslie Knope,"This guy was drunk, and he was aggressive."
Leslie Knope,"And he was rude, and he was foulmouthed."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"And he called me by my second least favorite term for a woman, and my campaign manager punched him."
Leslie Knope,"I do not condone violence, but I have to be honest, it was awesome."
Leslie Knope,And my campaign manager and I made out a lot afterward.
Leslie Knope,Fight it.
Leslie Knope,"No, Leslie, fight it."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, maybe just this once."
Leslie Knope,"I need to protect a sweet couple from a sex crazed demon librarian who makes me question my stance on using the ""B"" word."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, I probably shouldn't have said that."
Leslie Knope,"This may be the hardest challenge yet for Leslie Knope, emotional guardian."
Leslie Knope,So you can ruin his life?
Leslie Knope,Of course it does.
Leslie Knope,"Shouldn't you be at the library, forcing people to borrow books?"
Leslie Knope,"Everything's fine, we're just gonna chat."
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Leslie Knope,Diane ugh.
Leslie Knope,The stuff with Tammy is so complex and weird and gross.
Leslie Knope,It just would probably be better if you let me handle it.
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,"Never! Hey, game over, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Few hours, you say?"
Leslie Knope,You'll never get him back.
Leslie Knope,Ron's gone.
Leslie Knope,"Too late, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Good to know.
Leslie Knope,"I think you should take my car and go get Diane, and I will handle Tammy."
Leslie Knope,I know that you secretly love artichokes and plums.
Leslie Knope,I know when your birthday is.
Leslie Knope,"By Swanson standards, we're close."
Leslie Knope,"We are close friends, and I'm very involved in your life."
Leslie Knope,I kind of see where Diane is coming from.
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, I don't think it's about dating."
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, one man's ""worst nightmare"" is every other man's ""total package."""
Leslie Knope,She's threatened by our relationship.
Leslie Knope,"No, she left because of me."
Leslie Knope,She left.
Leslie Knope,I'm happily engaged.
Leslie Knope,"Diane, you misunderstand."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,You me?
Leslie Knope,You who?
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,I made my decision. I need to stick to it.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am a little curious."
Leslie Knope,I don't know about this.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've never even had an MRI before."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, it's good that you found your calling."
Leslie Knope,Thisâ¦ it's just bread in there.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you look inside this bread, all you're gonna find is more bread."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with her?
Leslie Knope,"So, do you enjoy it, being an MRI technician?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe someday we'll tell our grandkids how weird our first date was and how creepy their grandfather was.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Let's just start from the beginning, I guess."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, you kind of did."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, you didn't."
Leslie Knope,I don'tâ¦ I don't know. They're not. Forget it.
Leslie Knope,"You know, isn't it funny how these setups are always just so awkward?"
Leslie Knope,Like swings and slides and stuff.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, it's regular parks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, she's my number one best friend."
Leslie Knope,I'm just glad that we could make this happen.
Leslie Knope,It's not important.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,Well hopefully there'll be nothing to diagnose.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Does that matter?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, actually, Chris, it was nice to meet you, but I think this is gonna be our last date."
Leslie Knope,Should we go?
Leslie Knope,Are you serious?
Leslie Knope,Is that bad?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What's weird?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,Why would you think he'd be perfect for me then?
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to offend you, you know? I know he's your friend."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there, but this guy is nuts."
Leslie Knope,We just finished the MRI.
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,"So we're done, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, time to go."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"It was, like, three years ago."
Leslie Knope,I'm surprised you can see that.
Leslie Knope,"One time I was on my bike and some boys were making fun of me, so I chased them and I lost control."
Leslie Knope,All kinds.
Leslie Knope,Can I answer that?
Leslie Knope,Yes she does.
Leslie Knope,I'm from Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Indiana Hoosiers!
Leslie Knope,Boo!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well done, Ann."
Leslie Knope,He has the brains of George Clooney in the body of Joe Biden.
Leslie Knope,"I dated Dave for three months, so if I continue that pattern, I won't be over him for... Five hundred years."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I was only with Mark for one night, and then I was hung up on him for six years."
Leslie Knope,"It has been a while since Dave left, and I think I might be ready to start dating again."
Leslie Knope,I've been thinking.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I know you're really busy.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,"Well, these green things represent trees."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I am."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, stop."
Leslie Knope,I've got everything laid out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go into the conference room."
Leslie Knope,"This is my colleague, Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,"If you want to start a fire, But you have to do it fast--"
Leslie Knope,"Ah, I love those commercials!"
Leslie Knope,That's interesting.
Leslie Knope,Is it locking up the bad guys or keeping them on the streets?
Leslie Knope,"So, what is your specialty?"
Leslie Knope,"That's my motto, too."
Leslie Knope,Is a friend of mine!
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,Actually I was thinkingâ¦
Leslie Knope,This was your idea.
Leslie Knope,What about Justin?
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,Are you Chris?
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Good call.
Leslie Knope,It's gotta be red.
Leslie Knope,What should I wear?
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't have one of those."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'll wear a giant red hat."
Leslie Knope,I'll wear a red rose in my hair.
Leslie Knope,How's he gonna know it's me?
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,Thanks!
Leslie Knope,Who is he?
Leslie Knope,Is that his blood?
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,"No, I've been running around all day."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to date a twin, 'cause I've been tricked before."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, just one rule."
Leslie Knope,"Go, Ann, go!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good, great, yes!"
Leslie Knope,"Don't be sorry, I mean, if you think it wasn't gonna work, orâ¦"
Leslie Knope,I think it would. No?
Leslie Knope,What is it though?
Leslie Knope,Is there something wrong with him?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I feel like we kind of hit it off in there."
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,I drove us here.
Leslie Knope,I'm not above using my expertise to change hearts and minds if the cause is just.
Leslie Knope,Nothing better than good old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning.
Leslie Knope,"I have a secret weapon, canvassing."
Leslie Knope,I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, did you clear your schedule?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, have you booked the hall yet?"
Leslie Knope,Are we prepared for tomorrow night?
Leslie Knope,Subcommittee members.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Metal.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody's here."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,That's why I fake invited you.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,You know-- You want to come?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,It's a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it is."
Leslie Knope,It's no biggie.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm leading it."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we're having a town hall meeting tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. at the Smithfield Community Center."
Leslie Knope,"When I was in sixth grade, I was voted Best Dressed by 87 votes."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,And there were only 63 people in my class. Andy fell into that pit.
Leslie Knope,How many more Pawnee citizens are gonna have to fall into that pit before we turn it into a park?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,That's-- Go to section three.
Leslie Knope,How would you feel if we turned that pit into a beautiful community park?
Leslie Knope,Positive response.
Leslie Knope,Excellent!
Leslie Knope,May we speak with you for a moment about the Sullivan Street pit?
Leslie Knope,We are representatives from your local government.
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,But confident.
Leslie Knope,Look humble.
Leslie Knope,Are you pumped up?
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be fun.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, someone's in there."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go!
Leslie Knope,And we're gonna win.
Leslie Knope,"We have even sectors, you guys have odd sectors."
Leslie Knope,You guys are a team.
Leslie Knope,Ann and I are a team.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be the script that we use when we speak with people.
Leslie Knope,Uhâ¦. And this is our canvassing guide.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you probably won't need any."
Leslie Knope,I've got some sunscreen for your beaks.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Zero.
Leslie Knope,I fell into that pit.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming in.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'm sure you've heard something about it.
Leslie Knope,Go get him.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,If this situation is weird or if you feel weird--
Leslie Knope,Porter's Grill at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,This is a prescription for Denise Dogan.
Leslie Knope,Hey! I was just calling you.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, I would like to hit that, but Ann's being a little weird about it."
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I would love... Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Well, Justin, I just... I can't thank you enough."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,"""Frivolous."""
Leslie Knope,Very forceful language. I'm a little scared.
Leslie Knope,"""Burden of proof."""
Leslie Knope,"""Cease and desist."""
Leslie Knope,This is really good.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Should weâ¦?
Leslie Knope,"No, come on in."
Leslie Knope,"What? Not sexually. God, what's wrong with you, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,I just don't understand why the hell Ann thought we'd be a good fit.
Leslie Knope,The bad news is I got an MRI bill for 2000 dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the good news is I don't have cancer."
Leslie Knope,Goodie.
Leslie Knope,"I'm back on the horse, and this horse is a lawyer, so I'm looking forward to riding him."
Leslie Knope,People are talking about it.
Leslie Knope,"No, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Now, she's our newest employee."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I have my own subcommittee now.
Leslie Knope,I just remembered something.
Leslie Knope,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"But it looks like you're super busy, and I am super busy, so I shall bid you adieu."
Leslie Knope,"Just here to gossip, gab, chat, stuff we do."
Leslie Knope,Choosing in.
Leslie Knope,"Right, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"She's as powerful as Stalin, and she's as beautiful as Margaret Thatcher."
Leslie Knope,She's as respected as Mother Teresa.
Leslie Knope,How do I explain her?
Leslie Knope,She's my hero.
Leslie Knope,She's a big mucky-muck in the county school system.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to see my mom.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna find one.
Leslie Knope,Let's keep looking.
Leslie Knope,I don't think a single egg has been found yet.
Leslie Knope,"And if so, he's succeeding."
Leslie Knope,Maybe Tom's trying to make this year a challenge.
Leslie Knope,And I'm an adult.
Leslie Knope,I've been searching for 25 minutes and I haven't found a single egg.
Leslie Knope,"Tom hides the eggs, and I have to say he did an exceptional job this year."
Leslie Knope,"Well, one of the funner things that we do here in Pawnee is the annual Easter egg hunt."
Leslie Knope,"Well, everybody, let's get back to work."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, come and celebrate!"
Leslie Knope,To April!
Leslie Knope,"Ten months ago, she was an intern who could give a C- R- A- P about local government."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, yeah, of course!"
Leslie Knope,"Lot 48 was once a horrible and disgusting pit, and now it's the site of Pawnee's Winter Wonderland."
Leslie Knope,Classic!
Leslie Knope,"I am being supported, of course, by the Glitter Factory and 1-800-Mattress."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope you can all join me at my fundraiser tonight."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to go into the details, but let me just say that it involves multiple women, a love child, nurses, rabbis, priests."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there is a new one, and it's a doozy."
Leslie Knope,Some of the jokes are sort of inside.
Leslie Knope,Sid Asnov is a former city councilman.
Leslie Knope,Prepare to laugh your Asnov!
Leslie Knope,"Each December, one department puts on a show that spoofs what happened in our town."
Leslie Knope,"You are getting a rare glimpse at this exclusive, government only event."
Leslie Knope,How could there possibly still be glitter on me?
Leslie Knope,Does anyone else know that you like your wife? Does your wife know that you like your wife?
Leslie Knope,That's a bummer.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you like your wife?"
Leslie Knope,Start again.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh! Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, because you're a Libyan!"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I know last night was really rough, but all I want for you is to be able to get over this."
Leslie Knope,"So, how you feeling? Rough morning?"
Leslie Knope,You have a lovely home.
Leslie Knope,You two should get married and start a club for people who betray Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, Wendy? You and Ron will be perfect for each other."
Leslie Knope,You're not even divorced yet and you're inviting other men over?
Leslie Knope,This could not be more perfect if I had planned it myself.
Leslie Knope,You insensitive little hussy.
Leslie Knope,Which I did.
Leslie Knope,"So, let's talk skedge, guys."
Leslie Knope,It was fine.
Leslie Knope,"Believe me, I would have remembered this."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I-- No one-- I haven't-- I haven't heard any of this, ever, in my whole life."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What are we talking about?
Leslie Knope,Nobody told me nothing!
Leslie Knope,Nobody.
Leslie Knope,Who told me?
Leslie Knope,"I'd just like to say that I have nothing to apologize for, except for perhaps being too incisive."
Leslie Knope,I am assuming this is about my performance in the Government Follies last night.
Leslie Knope,It's my pleasure.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Dexhart?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, I'll be here all week!"
Leslie Knope,And often.
Leslie Knope,He got off easy.
Leslie Knope,I could've been a lot harder on him.
Leslie Knope,I got nothing to apologize for.
Leslie Knope,I'm not scared.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,Dismissed.
Leslie Knope,"Any questions, direct them to me."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"6:00 p.m., caroling with the youth choir, and I am proud to announce, for the first time ever this year, our tree lighting ceremony will be simulcast on Internet radio."
Leslie Knope,"The kids are gonna come at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday, and everyone's gonna do Santa for two hours, so I would just advise everyone, before you get in your costume, to go to the bathroom, so we can avoid what happened last year."
Leslie Knope,And it's awesome.
Leslie Knope,Pretty straightforward.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Wendy."
Leslie Knope,And I gave her money to writhe around on your parts.
Leslie Knope,It's loud in here.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sierra.
Leslie Knope,This is Seabiscuit.
Leslie Knope,"All right, Tom!"
Leslie Knope,"You're one of the good ones, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Is it always like this?
Leslie Knope,It is rough in here.
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, go put these in places I do not approve of."
Leslie Knope,'Cause there are some feminist scholars who say that stripping is a feminist act.
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like Jane Goodall studying the chimps, you know?"
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna actually be on me.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm paying for them."
Leslie Knope,Lap dances are on me.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,So don't blow this.
Leslie Knope,But I'm willing to sacrifice all that I've worked for just to put a smile on your perverted little face.
Leslie Knope,"I've gone on record that if I had to have a stripper's name, it would be ""Equality."""
Leslie Knope,"I would never, ever go to a strip club."
Leslie Knope,"I'm a feminist, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"Well, drop out of school and start doing meth."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take April home.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,We are going to the Glitter Factory.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I already paid her."
Leslie Knope,"We took Tom out tonight, and he had a little bit too much to drink."
Leslie Knope,Can I get my money back?
Leslie Knope,"I just gotta say, Sierra."
Leslie Knope,From the knees.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"Could you carry him out of here, please? And, you know, also maybe not have sex with his wife?"
Leslie Knope,"Good, okay."
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,It makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies.
Leslie Knope,"If they're not wagering their girlfriends in pool, then they're trying to steal each other's wives."
Leslie Knope,I don't get men.
Leslie Knope,"What is wrong with you? I wish I wasn't alive to hear myself say this, but I am ashamed to be your deputy."
Leslie Knope,Swanson! Did you tell Tom that you were gonna ask out Wendy?
Leslie Knope,What? Ron?
Leslie Knope,It's exactly how I felt when that Planet Earth series ended.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's perfectly normal to feel devastated when something's over."
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,That'll be all.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Seabiscuit."
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Is it because you have a strong, positive female figure watching you?"
Leslie Knope,Stripper dancing action!
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"And then, afterwards, maybe reconsider your profession, but for now, grind away."
Leslie Knope,Really grind the sorrow out of him.
Leslie Knope,Give my friend here the works.
Leslie Knope,"But go crazy, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I really don't get why this cheers men up, because it's very insincere and it's very fleeting."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let her do her writhing."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we understand that people are busy, but we would love for you to come to the meeting and toâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Short meeting.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"My friends, my career."
Leslie Knope,My life is here.
Leslie Knope,I can't go to San Diego with you.
Leslie Knope,You know what? You're a class act.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,This is utterly humiliating.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it's come to this.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you look for yourself?
Leslie Knope,"Here, Joan."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,He has never seen my butt.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,You've never seen my butt.
Leslie Knope,What? That is a total lie.
Leslie Knope,"We do not have a private life! Stop saying that we have a private life! The fact is, we never slept together, and if we did, you would have proof, and we would have seen it by now."
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell me he was gonna be here?
Leslie Knope,You should be grilling Councilman Dexhart.
Leslie Knope,I don't understand why I'm on trial here.
Leslie Knope,"We met for about 15 minutes, and then I went home, alone, and that's the whole story."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, I spoke with Councilman Dexhart for the first time that night."
Leslie Knope,You've got it wrong.
Leslie Knope,She's a--
Leslie Knope,She's not myâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"I really care about you, Dave."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I just-- I love this town.
Leslie Knope,You want your ticket back?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, maybe."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, it feels a little too soon."
Leslie Knope,"I asked the police department if I could have it, and they said no, so I stole it."
Leslie Knope,"I know, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,"I really miss him. Yeah, I'm just trying to enjoy the memories."
Leslie Knope,I just wish I liked it.
Leslie Knope,It was the only sandwich on the board that wasn't named.
Leslie Knope,Salami on pumpernickel with olice juice and extra iceberg.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that'd be terrific."
Leslie Knope,He didn't call me back.
Leslie Knope,"I called the city attorney, like, 50 times."
Leslie Knope,I know about this issue.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is Leslie Knope in the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,Because he loved his job.
Leslie Knope,"Now, could he have? Well, maybe not towards the end of his life, but he would have."
Leslie Knope,But would he have? Yes.
Leslie Knope,You think Winston Churchill ever had to pull his pants down and show his butt? No.
Leslie Knope,It's gotten a lot harder to work in government.
Leslie Knope,It should've been lighted up an hour ago.
Leslie Knope,But it's almost 9:00.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God! Is something wrong with the tree?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom."
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,He's a busy guy.
Leslie Knope,I'm really happy that I have the chance to clear my name.
Leslie Knope,"If you think that you can drag me and my friend through the mud, then you've got-- Yes, I'll hold."
Leslie Knope,I can't!
Leslie Knope,Who's saying that?
Leslie Knope,"I'd never even met Councilman Dexhart before yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about the matter."
Leslie Knope,I have nothing to hide.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I'm not afraid to say anything.
Leslie Knope,"You need to put some tights on, though, and I want you to make sure you keep your neckline nice and high."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look good."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,"And that man would be the vice president, and I would be the president."
Leslie Knope,Except I always assumed that I would be the politician and the man would be accused of sleeping with me.
Leslie Knope,I would be lying if I said that I never thought I would be involved in an incident like this.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do my job.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let these people intimidate me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, keep your ear to the ground."
Leslie Knope,What have you heard?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"April, I appreciate that, but I don't think it's something worth losing your virginity over."
Leslie Knope,How would that help?
Leslie Knope,Give me some options.
Leslie Knope,How do I fight back?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,All I did was write and perform in one amazing skit.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What the--
Leslie Knope,I have too much work to do.
Leslie Knope,"Joan, I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be on your show."
Leslie Knope,This department is not gonna deputy direct itself.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is Leslie Knope, and I would like Joan to clear all of her guests tomorrow, because I'm coming on the show."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Get out of here!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"If you don't hold a press conference, I'm gonna come forward and tell the whole story."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, with all due respect, get a grip."
Leslie Knope,I want you to hold a press conference and clear my name.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart, this has gone far enough."
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't even competing or anything, he just was going, literally, to watch the Olympics."
Leslie Knope,"In 2004, a kid from Pawnee went to the Olympics, and it was reported on for over a year."
Leslie Knope,"In a 24 hour news cycle, the tiniest story gets dissected over and over again."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, for cripes sake!"
Leslie Knope,Aw!
Leslie Knope,I'm actually pretty good.
Leslie Knope,I took lessons when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,I know how to surf.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,This whole Dexhart thing is not making me feel very attached to Pawnee right now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I do, too."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Where you going?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Use your nightstick.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's sweet."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I swear to you, I never even met the guy before last night."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, crap."
Leslie Knope,She's gone.
Leslie Knope,Could the 4 year old watch the 2 year old?
Leslie Knope,I don't know how they all got here.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not the kind of person that's gonna throw someone out, or, you know, not let them in if they randomly show up."
Leslie Knope,"It's weird, but she just showed up."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,A belly dancer?
Leslie Knope,Who could that be?
Leslie Knope,I wonder who that is.
Leslie Knope,This sounds good.
Leslie Knope,And it has no bearing on the future of your class.
Leslie Knope,It won't affect my decision.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to be clear, this will in no way influence me."
Leslie Knope,"God, you're no help."
Leslie Knope,"You know, people hear about a killer party at Knope's house, they all come running."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, focus!"
Leslie Knope,I saw Justin yawn.
Leslie Knope,There was a lull.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need your help."
Leslie Knope,Who else is gay?
Leslie Knope,Discuss that.
Leslie Knope,Crazy stuff.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,"Derek and Ben are gay, but often, on occasion, April will have relations with Derek."
Leslie Knope,"This is something, Justin."
Leslie Knope,He'll get over it.
Leslie Knope,Now's your chance!
Leslie Knope,I've been telling you for weeks that you should tell her how you feel.
Leslie Knope,Please tell me that yawning is a sign of excitement in India or something.
Leslie Knope,"You don't do origami every day, do ya?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Are you having fun?
Leslie Knope,There's some Kabuki theater festival happening.
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna drive up and see him next weekend."
Leslie Knope,"So, did you get that? He said amazing and awesome."
Leslie Knope,"But, yes, yes, you will."
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of official business, so I can't talk about it right now."
Leslie Knope,No further questions.
Leslie Knope,I would've rescheduled.
Leslie Knope,You should've told me.
Leslie Knope,But you fell asleep.
Leslie Knope,"Could you define pleasant? Did you have a good time? Did you have a great time? Be specific, and do remember that you're under oath."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Anderson, could you please describe that evening?"
Leslie Knope,That will become clear.
Leslie Knope,I put a big white stallion in front of a little brown pony.
Leslie Knope,I put a beautiful man in front of an adorable man child.
Leslie Knope,I put a new romance in front of an old friendship.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm really sorry."
Leslie Knope,And hopefully then-to-be future wife.
Leslie Knope,I'm very sorry that I invited Wendy to the party.
Leslie Knope,"If I may, Phil, I'd like to say something to Tom on the record."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Just that I am looking forward to the truth coming out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, can you just stay? Okay? Justin, would you--"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, guys, please."
Leslie Knope,What course do you teach?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,There's not.
Leslie Knope,"We agreed that we should invite interesting people for Justin, and Wendy is an interesting person!"
Leslie Knope,Excellent!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Dinner is served!
Leslie Knope,To eventually become president.
Leslie Knope,To build a new park from scratch.
Leslie Knope,There are very few things I've asked for in this world.
Leslie Knope,I just want this dinner party to go well.
Leslie Knope,"Please, have a good time and shut your mouth."
Leslie Knope,What part of not talking do you not understand?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Don't use up your stories.
Leslie Knope,Everybody stop talking until Justin gets here.
Leslie Knope,No talking.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I have."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to my humble abode.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,That sounds very professional.
Leslie Knope,"Are you gonna be all right, tonight?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Tania, like I said over the phone--"
Leslie Knope,It smells great.
Leslie Knope,"So, how's it looking?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Five courses.
Leslie Knope,Stop winking.
Leslie Knope,And to one day solve a murder on a train.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I think it's fair to add this to the list.
Leslie Knope,That's Justin.
Leslie Knope,Unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's... Isn't it, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Unreal!
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna casually make my--
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,Is he having fun?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, can you see Justin?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, do you think this party's going well?"
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, get over here!"
Leslie Knope,"Like, maybe the Yellow Pages."
Leslie Knope,"Oh I think, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,The southern part's always the best part of anything.
Leslie Knope,"No, she doesn't."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,I cannot overhype it enough.
Leslie Knope,"Really, really, just like the best, most exciting night of your life."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a blast.
Leslie Knope,"I know, it's gonna be super fun."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to my very interesting party.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Everybody start talking.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, Justin's here!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did something wrong, and I felt bad."
Leslie Knope,"So, this morning I donated 1,000 dollars to the rec center, so everybody could keep teaching their classes."
Leslie Knope,"Are you kidding, Ann? It's every girl's dream to ask a dude how their date went under penalty of perjury."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"So, you still want to claim that corn syrup is healthy?"
Leslie Knope,"I think we should watch another video right now, one that your company made 30 years ago."
Leslie Knope,"You know, it doesn't, actually."
Leslie Knope,The questions were more relevant than usual.
Leslie Knope,I'm actually encouraged.
Leslie Knope,Somebody's grouchy.
Leslie Knope,Ron's upset because I didn't let him drive last night.
Leslie Knope,"Sidebar, Paul."
Leslie Knope,That way we won't be liable.
Leslie Knope,I think maybe we should hold a public forum.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, can you and I have a sidebar?"
Leslie Knope,Do you not care about your city's health?
Leslie Knope,That's a-- We're in a sidebar.
Leslie Knope,"I did some research, and NutriYums are terrible for you."
Leslie Knope,"Sidebar, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Paul, can I have a sidebar with Ron?"
Leslie Knope,We are worried that the energy bars that they're gonna sell are grossly unhealthy and they're misleading people about what's actually in them.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, no."
Leslie Knope,Punkass book jockeys!
Leslie Knope,"Go, go, go, go!"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, grab the movie!"
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't."
Leslie Knope,You're pretty cocky for someone whose job is obsolete because of the Internet.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Marci."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Newport, Jr., thank you so much for coming."
Leslie Knope,Just walk out.
Leslie Knope,"But don't you think that every person has a right to know what they're putting in their bodies? Right, everybody?"
Leslie Knope,That seems like an unfair phrasing.
Leslie Knope,Plus frittatas.
Leslie Knope,It's like Lilith Fair minus the angst.
Leslie Knope,Ladies celebrating ladies.
Leslie Knope,"Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home and we just come and kick it breakfast style."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's only the best day of the year."
Leslie Knope,What's Galentine's Day?
Leslie Knope,"A mosaic portrait of each of you made from the crushed bottles of your favorite diet soda, and a personalized 5000 word essay of why you are all so awesome."
Leslie Knope,A bouquet of handcrocheted flower pensâ¦
Leslie Knope,"If you look inside your bags, you will find a few things."
Leslie Knope,It's freezing outside.
Leslie Knope,Put a coat on.
Leslie Knope,Apology accepted.
Leslie Knope,I didn't have time to have breakfast.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and it gets better from there."
Leslie Knope,"The first line, by the way? ""O Captain! My Captain! Ron Swanson, a swan song."""
Leslie Knope,"By the way, maybe it's none of my business, but if you eat three pounds of steak every day, you're gonna die, and although I've already written your eulogy, and it's incredibly touching, I would prefer not to give it for a while."
Leslie Knope,"If you're gonna drink, you should use it, okay? I'm gonna head out."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Take the booze chart.
Leslie Knope,"So, here."
Leslie Knope,"May I speak with you, please? Look, I don't know if you're being a jerk on purpose just to prove you have the right to be a jerk, but either way, you're being a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"This is America, right? Is it?"
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,That's all we can do.
Leslie Knope,We informed the public.
Leslie Knope,You know what? We did our job.
Leslie Knope,"And all those in favor of letting this heartless corporation, Sweetums, stuff your children with sugary crap, raise your hand."
Leslie Knope,"Denver, you little son of a bitch."
Leslie Knope,This is not gonna affect my decision at all.
Leslie Knope,"Here, just let me stick them under my shirt."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, let's take them both."
Leslie Knope,I watched a really good--
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,That's what I get the most from this.
Leslie Knope,The dealer really has an advantage.
Leslie Knope,Twenty minutes.
Leslie Knope,"""Insurance is a side bet when you wager half of your original bet because you believe the dealer has a 10 in the hole."""
Leslie Knope,"We're just gonna sit and wait until, you know, you're safe to drive, which would be in about one hour."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not gonna argue with you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"And on the back, it teaches you how to play blackjack."
Leslie Knope,It comes in handy.
Leslie Knope,Looks like you are just over the line into impaired.
Leslie Knope,"What are you, 5'11"", 210 pounds, three whiskeys?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll let the chart be the judge of that."
Leslie Knope,"Your keys, please."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Shoelace.
Leslie Knope,They're all wearing vests!
Leslie Knope,Look at them.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that family looks so healthy."
Leslie Knope,"When you think of Pawnee, you think of Sweetums."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't love the idea of corporate sponsorship, but Sweetums is an institution."
Leslie Knope,"Starting next month, Sweetums is gonna take over the concession stands in our parks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, as far as white, leather suits goâ¦"
Leslie Knope,You look like Encyclopedia Brown.
Leslie Knope,"But the most important thing is, there is now an official government document that proves my dinner party kicked ass."
Leslie Knope,I'm not proud of my actions.
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Leslie Knope,We might find something interesting.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, are you moving out?"
Leslie Knope,This place is evil.
Leslie Knope,I hate it here.
Leslie Knope,Back to work.
Leslie Knope,I can't open them.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"'Cause I've eaten, like, 40 of these."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm gonna crash soon, too."
Leslie Knope,That makes sense.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Look how happy everybody is.
Leslie Knope,"Well, people seem to enjoy them."
Leslie Knope,There's only eight grams of fat.
Leslie Knope,There's a picture of Lance Armstrong on there.
Leslie Knope,"No, they're not."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna sell these in the park now.
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat them, Sweetums!"
Leslie Knope,"You might need one of these, NutriYum, by Sweetums."
Leslie Knope,You're looking pretty unhealthy today.
Leslie Knope,Look at you!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,"Great, right?"
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,The time is now.
Leslie Knope,It's right now.
Leslie Knope,Have you told Wendy how you feel yet?
Leslie Knope,I feel like I'm in a spa.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I insist on paying."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,How much do I owe you?
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming out tonight.
Leslie Knope,That's illegal.
Leslie Knope,I can't do that.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,"Line up, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go."
Leslie Knope,Good girl.
Leslie Knope,"Good girl, good girl, good ""probably."""
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
Leslie Knope,This is serious!
Leslie Knope,"Please, April!"
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
Leslie Knope,And I need you to sell the crap out of the park.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, and if the questions start getting negative, I'm gonna call on you."
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you in the audience."
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I am.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,It's a very breathable fabric--
Leslie Knope,I doubt it.
Leslie Knope,You know me.
Leslie Knope,This is our first town meeting about the proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan Street into a community park.
Leslie Knope,I'll push anything through anything.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"None of them were able to make it tonight, unfortunately."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,He is a local resident and he tragically fell in the pit.
Leslie Knope,That is Andy Dwyer.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,He's capable of anything.
Leslie Knope,He's the man.
Leslie Knope,Certainly did not.
Leslie Knope,He's amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak.
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz knows the answer to every question.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Here we are.
Leslie Knope,"Uh... So, what would he say?"
Leslie Knope,"We are a little ahead of schedule, because we're holding this town hall meeting so soon, which I was warned about by Mark Brendanawicz, our city planner assigned to this project."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I remember you.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,No questions right now.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I see a question."
Leslie Knope,I did not make them up.
Leslie Knope,But they totally exist.
Leslie Knope,"Now, there are many people that I spoke to who are passionately in support of this idea."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a five-minute break, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this meeting needs to be canceled."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I need to be accessible.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a public servant."
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, he said some upsetting things."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for your time, sir."
Leslie Knope,We got one.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's next month, forget about it."
Leslie Knope,I didn't--
Leslie Knope,"It's-- What I mean is, kids love parks and you should, too."
Leslie Knope,You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park!
Leslie Knope,We surveyed crystal meth users.
Leslie Knope,Survey.
Leslie Knope,Would you change your mind if I told you that nine out of 10 meth users said the same exact thing?
Leslie Knope,"Wouldn't you agree, like most decent Americans, that it would be a good idea to turn the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street into a beautiful community park?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, don't worry about it, I made it all up."
Leslie Knope,"If you want to guarantee the results of a survey, you design the question to give you the answer that you want."
Leslie Knope,This is a little something I learned from Karl Rove.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I didn't want it to have to come to this, but, Ann, please open the sealed envelope that's in your binder."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,Or we could drink some water.
Leslie Knope,Let's blow on each other's faces.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm hot, too."
Leslie Knope,No means yes.
Leslie Knope,Nose to the grindstone.
Leslie Knope,"Keep going, keep moving."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Game changer.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Did my name come up at all?
Leslie Knope,Fast-track?
Leslie Knope,I have to cancel this meeting.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,City manager?
Leslie Knope,Only for 1 to 90 days.
Leslie Knope,"Canvassing was okay, but I think we're gonna have to postpone the town meeting."
Leslie Knope,"""Now we understand why you are the first female President of the United States."""
Leslie Knope,"And they say, ""President Knope, this park is awesome."""
Leslie Knope,That I one day visit with my White House staff on my birthday.
Leslie Knope,And it is my dream to build a park.
Leslie Knope,'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,But not here.
Leslie Knope,"""Nikolai! Do you want to swim in the dirt?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Hey, Vlad! Look at these rocks! Let's pretend they're potatoes!"""
Leslie Knope,"You know, in Russia, they could pretend that pit was a park, bring their kids down there."
Leslie Knope,Maybe because a pit filled with garbage isn't the best that we can do in America.
Leslie Knope,Don't-- Why do I want to build this park so bad?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, put those on."
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a nurse's costume?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,He's a cute FDR.
Leslie Knope,We'll wheel him around the neighborhood to get sympathy.
Leslie Knope,He's our symbol.
Leslie Knope,We need Andy.
Leslie Knope,You just busted the game wide open.
Leslie Knope,How old are your kids?
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Democracy's happening.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Tom!"
Leslie Knope,Just be there at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,"Now, it will be five courses."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Not including dessert.
Leslie Knope,Four.
Leslie Knope,Three.
Leslie Knope,"Now, get out of here!"
Leslie Knope,You're my best friend.
Leslie Knope,So much work to do!
Leslie Knope,And make sure that Mark is coming.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I want you to come over to my house at 2:00 and help me get ready."
Leslie Knope,Our lunches are like think tanks.
Leslie Knope,Our lunches.
Leslie Knope,"It's called a think tank, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I know what you meant, but I took your idea and I made it better."
Leslie Knope,"I'll invite all my most interesting friends over, we'll have this big rambling party."
Leslie Knope,That's genius.
Leslie Knope,A dinner party!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he once ate fried cockatoo with a member of the Thai Royal Family."
Leslie Knope,I've racked my brain and I can't come up with one exciting idea.
Leslie Knope,You better.
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,"In fact, our date in Pawnee is gonna blow Indianapolis out of the water."
Leslie Knope,I'll plan something exciting.
Leslie Knope,"Excellent, yeah."
Leslie Knope,This is me.
Leslie Knope,I'm having an A list dinner party for Justin.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"And you, out of all my friends, come from the most distant and exotic land."
Leslie Knope,Can you make it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, is this Maria Portlesman from ""Organize Your Life, with Maria Portlesman""?"
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Andy's gonna come over soon, he can help us with all this stuff."
Leslie Knope,"Well, if two birds come along?"
Leslie Knope,I might need it.
Leslie Knope,Don't throw that out!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, the first rumblings of Iran Contra!"
Leslie Knope,"So, I just need you to help me put the finishing touches on everything."
Leslie Knope,But I have a system.
Leslie Knope,It's a little messy.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to my house, for the very first time."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Justin is coming into town.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Tom, Mark and Ann."
Leslie Knope,Really fun people.
Leslie Knope,"I'd pay you, like, 10 bucks an hour."
Leslie Knope,And I thought maybe you could help me with serving and taking people's coats.
Leslie Knope,I'm having a partyâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen."
Leslie Knope,Isn't that polish gonna get on people's butts when they sit down?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Save it for the party.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Justin."
Leslie Knope,"But we will have many public forums in the future, and we hope to see you all there."
Leslie Knope,It's 9 o' clock.
Leslie Knope,We're out of time.
Leslie Knope,That concludes our meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,One by one.
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I want everyone up, lined up behind that microphone, and I want to hear from all of you."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we will take a vote."
Leslie Knope,Could you tell us how you feel about this park? Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top.
Leslie Knope,Someone I don't know.
Leslie Knope,And I would love to listen to someone else.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you did already talk, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,It's just the thought of him with someone else is making me miserable.
Leslie Knope,"And now, I'd like to take a magical journey through a little something I like to call The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster."
Leslie Knope,"The future of Pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis, where we will communicate on watches, and blink our feelings to each other, rather than use words."
Leslie Knope,"I can't speak of the future, but I will."
Leslie Knope,Filibuster! Boom! They can't touch you if you talk forever.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is lousy with hippies--
Leslie Knope,Man walks on the moon.
Leslie Knope,Flash forward to 1969.
Leslie Knope,"He planted his flag in the ground and was met soon after by an angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians, who, when seeing the whiteness of his skin, twisted him to death."
Leslie Knope,"The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, when a young man by the name of Reverend Luther Howell came from Terre Haute on an ox."
Leslie Knope,"Before we continue, I'd love to just give you a little history of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, at least they aren't apathetic, right?"
Leslie Knope,People are talking.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's really good!"
Leslie Knope,It was tough.
Leslie Knope,That's democracy.
Leslie Knope,Justin is definitely the most interesting guy I've ever dated.
Leslie Knope,It's just being really withholding.
Leslie Knope,That fish over there kind of reminds me of my mom.
Leslie Knope,"Last time, we had a private tour and cocktails at the Indianapolis Aquarium."
Leslie Knope,"We've only been out a few times, but every one of them has been amazing."
Leslie Knope,I am on a date with Justin in Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I want to go!
Leslie Knope,"The French kissing was just from a boy in my biscuits class, but either way, lesson learned."
Leslie Knope,"It's where I learned hair braiding, and how to make biscuits, and French kissing."
Leslie Knope,I've been taking these rec center classes since I was in high school.
Leslie Knope,Nobody's more upset about this than me.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, no, hopefully it's bad."
Leslie Knope,Hopefully your attendance is good!
Leslie Knope,"So, just make sure your students leave with a smile."
Leslie Knope,By attendance and student evaluations.
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm very sorry."
Leslie Knope,"The city took away 1,000 dollars from our budget."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, this year we will have to remove five jewels from that crown."
Leslie Knope,"And it's because of you, our teachers, that every one of these recreation classes in this catalog shines like a jewel in Pawnee's beautiful crown."
Leslie Knope,"Hear that? He called me ""park lady."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"God, I loved it! I loved every minute of it."
Leslie Knope,But guess what? My subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight.
Leslie Knope,You just gotta get past the negative people.
Leslie Knope,There are a lot of people here that want this park.
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, that's Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,I have to take him to a place where he can't possibly be sad.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the sadness is pouring out of Tom, like blood from a pterodactyl after it's attacked by a T-Rex."
Leslie Knope,You're a club promoter?
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Yeah! This is really fun! But I don't condone it!
Leslie Knope,This is for Mayor Percy! This is for the Parks Department office! This is for pooping on the handball court!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait! This is fun! This is fun! What do I do?"
Leslie Knope,And I kind of wanna TP his house.
Leslie Knope,"On the other hand, Greg Pikitis is a little punk."
Leslie Knope,That's the cornerstone of democracy.
Leslie Knope,I believe that you're innocent until proven guilty in this country.
Leslie Knope,"If that's the case, then there's another kid out there who's tormenting me."
Leslie Knope,"Huh, maybe Greg is innocent."
Leslie Knope,I'll finish cleaning this up.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why don't you go home?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Why would anyone do this?
Leslie Knope,Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,Then we're--
Leslie Knope,Let them think they've lost us.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"And if it matches your DNA, then you're going away for a long time."
Leslie Knope,We can get it tested.
Leslie Knope,"His DNA is all over it, I assume."
Leslie Knope,"Two words, peach pit."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, this is Officer Sanderson."
Leslie Knope,Mrs. Pikitis?
Leslie Knope,I didn't.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, I think we have the wrong house."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry you're bored.
Leslie Knope,She's texting me.
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,Who are you texting?
Leslie Knope,"April, stop that."
Leslie Knope,"So, I propose that we change our name from the Subcommittee for Pit Beautification to the Subcommittee for Lot Beautification."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sad that Old Gus is leaving, but it allows me to help Andy restart his life as Pioneer Hall's new shoeshine guy."
Leslie Knope,This truly is a day of mixed emotions for me.
Leslie Knope,"Does he have a lookalike or something? Did he have an accomplice? I mean, did he have help? How did that little turd do it?"
Leslie Knope,And Dave and I tailed Pikitis from the moment he left his house at 7:00 p.m. to the moment we came back here.
Leslie Knope,"How did he get in? First of all, we always lock the doors when we leave."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we were here all afternoon."
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,"But the thing that's driving me nuts is, how did he do it?"
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"Dave, just let me have this."
Leslie Knope,Then the judge will decide where he goes.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll let the jury decide."
Leslie Knope,Hey! You're going to jail for a very long time.
Leslie Knope,How did you get into the Parks Department? I have to know.
Leslie Knope,Let them go! Stay on the leader!
Leslie Knope,Make sure you--
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I knew it!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,You are?
Leslie Knope,"It's really hard to explain, but we were trying to get revenge on this kid, Greg Pikitis, and we thought this was his house, but I guess we got the address wrong."
Leslie Knope,Just handcuff him to something.
Leslie Knope,"Please, Dave, just arrest him."
Leslie Knope,His mom's gonna be here soon.
Leslie Knope,But I will waterboard you.
Leslie Knope,Scary cute.
Leslie Knope,"No, in a good way."
Leslie Knope,You have a scary face.
Leslie Knope,You talk to him first.
Leslie Knope,And send this to the lab.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, go and arrest him."
Leslie Knope,And it's still warm.
Leslie Knope,This is what he leaves all his victims.
Leslie Knope,This is his calling card.
Leslie Knope,This is his ace of spades.
Leslie Knope,He was eating a peach when I went to go talk to him.
Leslie Knope,This is a peach pit.
Leslie Knope,Believe me now?
Leslie Knope,It was Pikitis.
Leslie Knope,Pikitis!
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Where are my keys?
Leslie Knope,I hate suspect.
Leslie Knope,Look at stupid suspect.
Leslie Knope,Leaving location.
Leslie Knope,Can't we just fire a warning shot over his head as we drive by?
Leslie Knope,We'll go by my office and pick up my costume.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, let's go."
Leslie Knope,Like a little turd.
Leslie Knope,Like a turd.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Go talk to him.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Ask him about the peach pit.
Leslie Knope,In the conference room.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have been very civil."
Leslie Knope,"Because I followed you, genius!"
Leslie Knope,Somehow you found a way to get in here--
Leslie Knope,I don't care that you were in the parking lot all night.
Leslie Knope,I don't care what you say.
Leslie Knope,I know you did this.
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a coincidence, Greg."
Leslie Knope,"Then my office gets vandalized, and somebody leaves a peach pit on my desk?"
Leslie Knope,"When I came to visit you at the school, you were eating a peach."
Leslie Knope,I think you know what that is.
Leslie Knope,The gloves are coming off.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, out."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What's going on in here?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go finish him off.
Leslie Knope,Looks like Andy's wearing him down.
Leslie Knope,So imply that you're someone very important and that you can make his life hell.
Leslie Knope,He's never seen you before.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Nobody said torture.
Leslie Knope,"And it's gonna be just you, Pikitis, and these pliers."
Leslie Knope,Andy and I are going to take a walk.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And we need a confession.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he did."
Leslie Knope,Trying to hide his obvious guilt.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge."
Leslie Knope,Keep the momentum going.
Leslie Knope,Keep these minds working.
Leslie Knope,"This seems like a private matter, but I'm so--"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm just happy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, spare me the details."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,"New times are great, too, but there's just something about old times, you know what I mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I love talking about old times."
Leslie Knope,Old times?
Leslie Knope,So what did you guys talk about?
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,"So, how did your coffee with Tammy go?"
Leslie Knope,"When you meddle in someone's personal life, it's just so rewarding."
Leslie Knope,She's not a dragon.
Leslie Knope,"You know, she's not a murderer."
Leslie Knope,A nice woman.
Leslie Knope,Tammy's just a woman.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what is he afraid of?"
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I think Ron was acting like a baby, a little bit."
Leslie Knope,I got two people to put aside years of hostility and open a door to the possibility of friendship.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Donna."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Good start.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"We talked about it, we're still friends."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We slept together.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm happy that it went well and that you enjoyed your coffee."
Leslie Knope,I can't even tell you how many of my exes' weddings I've been to.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, you're going to."
Leslie Knope,The Planning Department Reprioritization Document?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, no."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we need to talk."
Leslie Knope,We're no longer government gals.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you better run."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna tell Ron what you just said, and this little game that you're playing is gonna be over."
Leslie Knope,I would never work at the Library Department.
Leslie Knope,What kind of lunatic would wanna be Cleopatra over Eleanor Roosevelt?
Leslie Knope,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,You're just using him to get Lot 48 for your library.
Leslie Knope,You don't care about Ron.
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, can I speak with you for a second?"
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,For what?
Leslie Knope,Are you giving her the lot?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, tell me the truth."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, have you been talking to Tammy about the lot?"
Leslie Knope,Or a library.
Leslie Knope,"It's kind of my thing, remember?"
Leslie Knope,I care a lot.
Leslie Knope,I care.
Leslie Knope,So I wrote it on a Post-it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm too classy to say ""I told you so,"" Donna."
Leslie Knope,I truly believe that everyone should be friends with their exes.
Leslie Knope,"Suspect laughing with friends and playing with his stupid skateboard in a snide, turdish manner."
Leslie Knope,Look at Mark and me.
Leslie Knope,She's a different person.
Leslie Knope,Everything's okay.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he hates her, but he knows her."
Leslie Knope,Or is that awful?
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.
Leslie Knope,Ron's ex-wife?
Leslie Knope,Does anybody know anybody that works at the library?
Leslie Knope,We need to make contact with someone there.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Jerks.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to steal Lot 48 for a new branch.
Leslie Knope,"They're mean, conniving, rude, and extremely well read, which makes them very dangerous."
Leslie Knope,The library is the worst group of people ever assembled in history.
Leslie Knope,We got a big problem with the library.
Leslie Knope,"News flash, we're screwed."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't wanna cause a panic."
Leslie Knope,"I need a good plan, though."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for pulling me out of there.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right."
Leslie Knope,"They're like a biker gang, but instead of shotguns and crystal meth, they use political savvy and shushing."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee's library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I've ever seen."
Leslie Knope,The library?
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,Or is it just the same?
Leslie Knope,I think it would be healthy for you to get a sense of closure.
Leslie Knope,Am I?
Leslie Knope,I have to go talk to her.
Leslie Knope,"She's changed, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Government gals.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the goal, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,"I want it to be a perfect park with a state-of-the-art swing set, and basketball courts, and off to the side, a lovely sitting area for kids with asthma to watch other kids play."
Leslie Knope,But I don't know how.
Leslie Knope,I know this is a trap.
Leslie Knope,And I'll see you in hell.
Leslie Knope,Here's your 3 dollars.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,That's why everybody hates the library.
Leslie Knope,"I should have known you'd use a low blow, dirty pool BS move like that."
Leslie Knope,That is so typical.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,I called a little while ago.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,This one will tear you up.
Leslie Knope,"And in case something bad goes down, I wore my sharpest rings."
Leslie Knope,I'm just looking forward to a thoughtful debate with Tammy about the relative merits of parks versus libraries.
Leslie Knope,"I knew that you had two ex-wives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one that you got along with and--"
Leslie Knope,I see.
Leslie Knope,Everybody has a weakness.
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, no?"
Leslie Knope,Does she have any weaknesses?
Leslie Knope,And you got to give me something I can use.
Leslie Knope,I am.
Leslie Knope,"He looks obnoxious and irritating, even from a great distance."
Leslie Knope,"8:22 p.m, suspect still with friends in parking lot."
Leslie Knope,You know what I mean?
Leslie Knope,The only con of you running would be that I don't get to run.
Leslie Knope,It's the same list.
Leslie Knope,The pros of me running for governor are the same thing.
Leslie Knope,And it would be a huge career move for you.
Leslie Knope,The kids could go to school in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We could make Pawnee our home base.
Leslie Knope,You would be a great governor.
Leslie Knope,Pros of you running for governor.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, obviously, weâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, obviouslyâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"She said that Governor Colquitt might be stepping down, and the DNC thinks that I should run for governor."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,So I had a pretty interesting conversation with Janet from the DNC tonight.
Leslie Knope,Let's pick teams.
Leslie Knope,Dr. Jill?
Leslie Knope,I'm going to take this energy and I'm going to go crush Joe Biden in charades.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is exciting."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Someone's been reading my kindergarten dream journal.
Leslie Knope,And vice versa.
Leslie Knope,For governor of Indiana?
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just talk about it after that?
Leslie Knope,Ann's here.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann's here."
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could be happier right now.
Leslie Knope,In this room.
Leslie Knope,We're all here together in the same room.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes, he can be wise."
Leslie Knope,"Or Andy, even."
Leslie Knope,Or Donna.
Leslie Knope,Or April.
Leslie Knope,Or Tom.
Leslie Knope,We should talk to Ron.
Leslie Knope,"You know, other people to weigh in."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we need fresh eyes.
Leslie Knope,"You know, now that I'm here, it's giving me an idea about this governor thing."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,You have a lesson tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Don't forget your ice skates.
Leslie Knope,Dinner!
Leslie Knope,Kids!
Leslie Knope,"No, but we don't have a choice, do we?"
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,We're going back to Pawnee in a week.
Leslie Knope,"You guys, Ann's here."
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, someone needs to take care of this place now."
Leslie Knope,"The superintendent of Bryce Canyon retired, and I convinced the superintendent of this park to transfer, shuffled a few things around."
Leslie Knope,You want to run it?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for meeting me here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,But we're also hosting several members of the House Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs.
Leslie Knope,We're having steak.
Leslie Knope,You want to stay for dinner?
Leslie Knope,I'm going to spend every waking moment trying to figure this out for you.
Leslie Knope,"Say no more, you big softie."
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you want to do now?"
Leslie Knope,There's a cute little park nearby.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's take a walk."
Leslie Knope,I love personal crossroads.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"So, Ron, what brings you here?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your family is beautiful."
Leslie Knope,Don't be a stranger.
Leslie Knope,You know what they say.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're going to come back here a lot."
Leslie Knope,"So, you think you're going to stick around Pawnee?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, Not bad craftsmanship, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Sex sells.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's a headline, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,"""Still Swinging: Parks Gang Reunites for One Last Bang."""
Leslie Knope,Thought it should be you.
Leslie Knope,But I'm always looking for new challenges.
Leslie Knope,Your job would be to walk around the land alone.
Leslie Knope,"You'd work outside, you'd talk to bears."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, the point is, yes, I do like working at Interior."
Leslie Knope,Joe Biden knows his way around a seafood risotto.
Leslie Knope,I've said it before and I'll say it again.
Leslie Knope,"Damn, that food was good."
Leslie Knope,"Well, as long as we get to play charades later."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to worry about me anymore.
Leslie Knope,I think I am past that point.
Leslie Knope,You say that every time we're here.
Leslie Knope,You promise?
Leslie Knope,What's going to happen between now and then?
Leslie Knope,All of these people in the same place at the same time.
Leslie Knope,That's all I want.
Leslie Knope,But when is this group of people ever going to be all together again?
Leslie Knope,"Babe, I don't want to seem dramatic, but I have just reconsidered every decision that we have made over the last year and I think we need to stay in Pawnee forever."
Leslie Knope,"You're welcome, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Well said.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee National Park Rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new superintendent and boss."
Leslie Knope,Let's go meet your staff.
Leslie Knope,I still remember how to forge your signature.
Leslie Knope,I already accepted for you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, today."
Leslie Knope,Stop being a dummy and accept.
Leslie Knope,"And as far as your qualifications, you're Ron Swanson."
Leslie Knope,But they'll get over it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, a few people might be annoyed."
Leslie Knope,Next argument.
Leslie Knope,You'd live in the same town you've always lived in.
Leslie Knope,"Because Tammy wants you to, and you do everything that she wants."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,You look like a cartoon princess.
Leslie Knope,Shows dedication.
Leslie Knope,"In a way, that's a compliment."
Leslie Knope,These are all the possible routes from Greg Pikitis' house to the statue.
Leslie Knope,Check this out.
Leslie Knope,Ends today.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Today.
Leslie Knope,It ends.
Leslie Knope,"It ends today, Pikitis."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I think you do."
Leslie Knope,"I've got the entire Parks Department watching you, my boyfriend's a cop, so don't even try it."
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe someone else is doing it, but I really feel like it's this kid."
Leslie Knope,"He's like an invisible, adolescent, James Bond super villain criminal mastermind."
Leslie Knope,"And I know it's Greg Pikitis, but I've never been able to prove it."
Leslie Knope,Every Halloween someone defaces the statue of Mayor Percy in Ramsett Park.
Leslie Knope,He absolutely terrorizes the Parks system.
Leslie Knope,"We got a history, Greg and I."
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, this kid makes me crazy."
Leslie Knope,And I'm here to tell you that this year it ends.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I'm the Parks lady.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's right."
Leslie Knope,Greg Pikitis.
Leslie Knope,I'm ready.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Good idea! Garry had a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,And all the trees and all the benches.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"It takes us, like, 10 days to clean his mess up."
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,Just stop him.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,By any means necessary.
Leslie Knope,Just stop him.
Leslie Knope,Don't go overboard.
Leslie Knope,But I give you permission to use excessive force.
Leslie Knope,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,Knock his head off if you have to.
Leslie Knope,"You see him, you stop him."
Leslie Knope,Commit this to memory.
Leslie Knope,8 dollars an hour.
Leslie Knope,You're officially on the Parks Department payroll.
Leslie Knope,Good news.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Were you listening to what I just said?
Leslie Knope,It's based on William Percy.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He wasn't Superman.
Leslie Knope,"During the Pawnee Bread Factory fire of 1922, he ran back into a burning building and saved the beloved secret recipe for Pawnee Pumpernickel."
Leslie Knope,And a true hero.
Leslie Knope,One of Pawnee's greatest mayors.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, William Percy."
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Relax.
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, Greg Pikitis sucks, and I wanna destroy him."
Leslie Knope,"Your hair looks amazing, by the way."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's about right."
Leslie Knope,"Well, there you have it, sir."
Leslie Knope,I think we should flip a coin.
Leslie Knope,Which is why I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, if one of us runs, it doesn't mean we're going to win."
Leslie Knope,It stinks.
Leslie Knope,I hate when we're on opposite sides.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's what I think."
Leslie Knope,"I've been so busy catching up with everyone, I haven't had a chance to ask them."
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Good call.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Our kids are falling in love.
Leslie Knope,It's happening! It's totally happening.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,Aren't you afraid that thing might give you cancer?
Leslie Knope,What's that thing on your wrist?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you opalescent tree shark."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful, sassy mannequin come to life."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you rainbow-infused space unicorn."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's confusing, because they're delicious."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"I took some of those, but I don't know, they didn't do anything and they kind of upset my stomach."
Leslie Knope,I mean it.
Leslie Knope,Another problem solved by the hard work of dedicated public servants.
Leslie Knope,Let's literally flip a coin.
Leslie Knope,"And whoever doesn't run is going to be right alongside the other one, offering advice and support and whatever they need."
Leslie Knope,A [bleep] library?
Leslie Knope,"Now, go find your team, and get to work."
Leslie Knope,"So, I thank those people who have walked with me, and I thank you for this honor."
Leslie Knope,"We do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing, alongside a team of people who we love."
Leslie Knope,But that's not why we do it.
Leslie Knope,Because it definitely is.
Leslie Knope,Not to say that public service isn't sexy.
Leslie Knope,"Which, to me, even now, is thrilling, because I love the work."
Leslie Knope,"And soon, a new, unknown challenge awaits me."
Leslie Knope,"I've had a lot of different jobs, including two terms as your governor."
Leslie Knope,"I started my career more than 30 years ago, in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.
Leslie Knope,"Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."""
Leslie Knope,"Small, incremental change, every day."
Leslie Knope,That's what public service is all about.
Leslie Knope,"When we worked here, together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people's lives a tiny bit better."
Leslie Knope,"But right now, I'd like to make a toast."
Leslie Knope,"Ben is going to be running my campaign, because he's a super genius and he's got a tight, compact little body like an Italian sports car."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm running for governor."
Leslie Knope,"And secondly, Ben and I have an announcement."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, gather around! First of all, I just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same time with your children here, it's like It's the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of America."
Leslie Knope,"And they can participate and they can sign the coin and then, you know, the coin will eventually make its way into the Smithsonian."
Leslie Knope,"So, let's go tell everybody."
Leslie Knope,"Because whatever's next, you and I are in it together."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,So let's flip a coin.
Leslie Knope,"So, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,Because whoever runs is going to do a great job.
Leslie Knope,Are you even listening to yourself?
Leslie Knope,You're defending the library now?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, the library?"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,You okay?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,And Ann is the best nurse in North America.
Leslie Knope,Ann's gonna take care of you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you know what is great?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"There we go, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Here's your Scotch, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, we called 911 and they're gonna send a ranger."
Leslie Knope,Are you in a lot of pain?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have your hat!"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I got your hat!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola, boola."
Leslie Knope,Just one of the guys.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you do!"
Leslie Knope,It seems like you like to go hunting with the same people 'cause you know you can beat them.
Leslie Knope,"There was a bird kind of near me, and I know how desperate you were to prove yourself."
Leslie Knope,You're surprised that my breasts didn't throw my aim off?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I swear to God, I've never shot anyone."
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Whoa! Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,That was pine trees.
Leslie Knope,He would never shoot himself there.
Leslie Knope,He loves the back of his head.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, he has seemed really depressed lately."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I think it's a little weird that nobody wants to admit that they shot Ron in the head."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, person who shot Ron."
Leslie Knope,"So, if you did it, just say, ""I did it."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's very curious about who shot him."
Leslie Knope,Although I am hoping that he has some memory loss.
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,"Well, good news is Ron is resting comfortably."
Leslie Knope,Just-- Open your mouth!
Leslie Knope,Open your mouth!
Leslie Knope,Open your mouth!
Leslie Knope,This is for your own good.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry we have to do this!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Is that normal?
Leslie Knope,Are you dizzy or--
Leslie Knope,How are you feeling?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, I swear, I didn't."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love.
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Leslie Knope,"All right, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you change your mind, you're now officially a licensed Indiana hunter."
Leslie Knope,Ready to bag some birds?
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,"And if you do it, I will name the first turkey I shoot after you."
Leslie Knope,"Well, try, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?
Leslie Knope,I'll write it down.
Leslie Knope,Can I just tell you the 16 digit tracking number or do you want me to write it down?
Leslie Knope,"I'm going hunting tomorrow, so call the State Parks Office and get verbal confirmation that our budget documentation is in."
Leslie Knope,I need you to do something for me.
Leslie Knope,April!
Leslie Knope,I'll bring S'mores.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so fun!
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,I am really good at hunting and I'm even better at being one of the guys.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,You're literally listening to turkey calls.
Leslie Knope,"I want me, Tom and all the other ladies included on your hunting trip."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, let's cut the bull."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, all the men."
Leslie Knope,"Every November, they let him use their cabin so he can go on a secret hunting trip with all the guys in the office."
Leslie Knope,Ron has a special deal with the park rangers.
Leslie Knope,The only trails he's gonna be surveying are trails of lies and deception.
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, when we allocate money for parks"
Leslie Knope,There he is.
Leslie Knope,I think this is gonna be a really good bonding sesh for me and Ron.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Bow to the Pants Queen.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, man, you snooze, you lose."
Leslie Knope,I saw a quail.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Ron, I know this weekend, you were looking forward to a lot of man on man on man action, but I just wanted to say I'm very grateful that you let me come along on this trip."
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, cool!"
Leslie Knope,Turkeys can.
Leslie Knope,Could you hear the difference?
Leslie Knope,Now here's the female adolescent turkey.
Leslie Knope,"All right, I hope you're ready to discuss some college bowl game scenarios!"
Leslie Knope,Perfect!
Leslie Knope,I have to hunt with Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, I always forget because you're so pretty, you're not used to rejection."
Leslie Knope,"Boy girl, boy girl."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I was thinking maybe we could do mixed doubles, you know?"
Leslie Knope,The only way to defeat the beast is to find the beast within.
Leslie Knope,And to the hunters!
Leslie Knope,Please!
Leslie Knope,"No, Donna, don't!"
Leslie Knope,"Donna, can you tell me why it's bad to look down the barrel of your gun?"
Leslie Knope,"All right, safety basics!"
Leslie Knope,"Am I right, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,Why they call it chew and not swallow.
Leslie Knope,"I'm full of surprises, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Let me get some of that.
Leslie Knope,That's why I have suspenders that connect my bra to my jeans.
Leslie Knope,"When you're out with the boys, you gotta be ready for a good pantsing."
Leslie Knope,I am the Pants Queen.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'll walk with you."
Leslie Knope,How is he?
Leslie Knope,Terribly.
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a good idea, Tom."
Leslie Knope,You just did.
Leslie Knope,You did.
Leslie Knope,Noâ¦
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to a restaurant--
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be pretty unapologetic.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I know there's a really fun documentary about tandem bicycles at the art house."
Leslie Knope,"You can go anywhere you want, our treat."
Leslie Knope,We'll make it Tom's night.
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we go out tonight, hit the town after work, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry you feel that way, little friend."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"""No, no, says I!"""
Leslie Knope,"""I am a guy and I like fire and playing hockey and eating meat!"""
Leslie Knope,"Don't be all, like, ""No, I don't want to."""
Leslie Knope,"Be supportive, okay?"
Leslie Knope,We are his safe bubble.
Leslie Knope,We have to help him.
Leslie Knope,"Tom always seems like Mr. Slickster Cool Guy, but he's actually hiding his emotions underneath a very thick layer of Axe body spray."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is the problem."
Leslie Knope,"We have to step up, for Tom's sake."
Leslie Knope,It's all bad.
Leslie Knope,"So, watch out, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, marriage is number seven."
Leslie Knope,"I did a little research, and divorce is the number two most stressful event in a person's life."
Leslie Knope,You love her.
Leslie Knope,I've seen you look at her ass when she leaves the room.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Look, I've heard your voice when she calls you on the phone."
Leslie Knope,"Dinosaurs, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"It's gonna be a crazy night, guys!"
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you guys just need some time apart, you know, to remember how much you care about each other."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,A goose heart?
Leslie Knope,A ruby?
Leslie Knope,A cheese fountain?
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,Think of something extravagant and we'll get it for you.
Leslie Knope,Champagne?
Leslie Knope,Want some steak?
Leslie Knope,"So, how you doing, buddy?"
Leslie Knope,Why would he do that?
Leslie Knope,"I thought I had Tom all figured out, but it's almost like he's faking being sad."
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,Ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"April, go ahead."
Leslie Knope,Just enjoy yourself.
Leslie Knope,The restaurant will just divide it evenly.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go ahead."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was weird, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Everyone should go around and say one thing that they love about Tom.
Leslie Knope,Here's what I think we should do.
Leslie Knope,"No, medium roar."
Leslie Knope,Medium roar.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna get the Tricera-chops, please."
Leslie Knope,I will see you at Jurassic Fork at 5:45 p.m.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Good stuff?
Leslie Knope,That kind of feels like your fault.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Tom, stop working."
Leslie Knope,"I'm wearing a new bra and it closes in the front, so it popped open and it threw me off."
Leslie Knope,I don't even remember.
Leslie Knope,I thought there was gonna be chocolate.
Leslie Knope,I was walking and I felt something icky.
Leslie Knope,I was thinking with my lady parts.
Leslie Knope,"I just I would I cared too much, I guess."
Leslie Knope,I let my emotions get the best of me.
Leslie Knope,End of story.
Leslie Knope,And that's what happened.
Leslie Knope,I got that tunnel vision that girls get.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's-- Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"I'm... While I was tripping, I saw a quail and I shot at it."
Leslie Knope,"No, I always have the safety on."
Leslie Knope,I was walking in the woods and then I tripped and my gun went off.
Leslie Knope,Fair enough.
Leslie Knope,I'm an excellent hunter.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Just go look after Ron.
Leslie Knope,I know what I'm doing.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,November.
Leslie Knope,What? No! No!
Leslie Knope,I shot Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,I am.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Leslie Knope,And no one saw it happen.
Leslie Knope,No one will admit they shot Ron.
Leslie Knope,"All I wanna do is have babies! Are you single? I'm just, like, going through a thing right now."
Leslie Knope,You should've autosaved that.
Leslie Knope,I guess when my life is incomplete I wanna shoot someone.
Leslie Knope,What? Bitches be crazy.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what those are.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so, so sorry."
Leslie Knope,I saw you on the fourth floor.
Leslie Knope,"And how are your institutions, that you're a part of?"
Leslie Knope,Uh-huh.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, how's everything in your life, generally?"
Leslie Knope,Tom and Wendy?
Leslie Knope,"I'm good, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Thank you, sir."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"They put a popcorn machine up there just to brighten things up, but they used the wrong kind of oil, and a bunch of people had to get their throats replaced."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"The DMV, divorce filings, probation offices."
Leslie Knope,The fourth floor is awful.
Leslie Knope,That is the creepiest place on Earth.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to go to the fourth floor.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Pants Queen!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, you know, I couldn't let--"
Leslie Knope,"Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you Sure."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm really sorry that I ruined your weekend."
Leslie Knope,And I'm stupid.
Leslie Knope,I'm bad at math.
Leslie Knope,I'm good at tolerating pain.
Leslie Knope,This would not happen if I had a penis.
Leslie Knope,"So to conclude our Galentine's Day breakfast, it is time for the greatest story ever told."
Leslie Knope,"But you and I both know that if we wanna find the money, we can."
Leslie Knope,But I think it would be a really great thing for the neighborhood.
Leslie Knope,I know everything about this town and these murals.
Leslie Knope,Tim Gunn.
Leslie Knope,Make it work.
Leslie Knope,Designers.
Leslie Knope,And you have one hour.
Leslie Knope,And it needs to be breath-taking and moving and historical and better than every department.
Leslie Knope,And make me a sketch.
Leslie Knope,I want you to go and find the spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"So, here are your supplies."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Order them to do this.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm ordering all of you to design a mural."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, shoot."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I've seen your fingernails.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's not true, Donna."
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Great singer, amazing arms."
Leslie Knope,Look at Madonna.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can have two legacies."
Leslie Knope,This could be our legacy.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this department has the chance to design something that could be in this building forever."
Leslie Knope,You really want to do this?
Leslie Knope,Your department literally specializes in crap.
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you work in Sewage."
Leslie Knope,"We also need better, less offensive history."
Leslie Knope,And that's why this is a dream come true.
Leslie Knope,We really need better security here.
Leslie Knope,Literally.
Leslie Knope,"But then it turned into a nightmare, because the mural started talking, and it came alive and it was whispering."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Bread Factory burned to the ground.
Leslie Knope,"June 8, 1922."
Leslie Knope,Or the music of Squeeze.
Leslie Knope,Like the Mona Lisa.
Leslie Knope,"If we're gonna beat all the other departments, we have to choose something that will stand the test of time."
Leslie Knope,I don't think they really got the assignment.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I have one question.
Leslie Knope,Disqualified!
Leslie Knope,"Really good, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Next?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Who am I thinking of?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he was."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he was great on ER."
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the best choice for Jesus?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I didn't know he was from Indiana.
Leslie Knope,Who's the Jesus?
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go first."
Leslie Knope,Let's get going with the spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"At one point, Gina Gershon was there."
Leslie Knope,"And I couldn't hear what it was saying, so I leaned in close, and then it ate me."
Leslie Knope,I have had a dream where I designed a mural.
Leslie Knope,We lost a lot of good bread that day.
Leslie Knope,Someone tried to stab it once.
Leslie Knope,And it's very controversial.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tammy, for that and many other reasons, Ron has decided to end this relationship."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, like a potted plant."
Leslie Knope,Don't believe anything she says.
Leslie Knope,Do not make eye contact with her.
Leslie Knope,Don't talk to her.
Leslie Knope,Here are the ground rules.
Leslie Knope,"So, would you like to be in the room when I tell her it's over, or would you rather wait outside?"
Leslie Knope,Let's go dump your ex.
Leslie Knope,I never said-- Point taken.
Leslie Knope,I would never use those words.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I don't think I should get involved in this.
Leslie Knope,You are Ron freaking Swanson.
Leslie Knope,Now sack up.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Ron, I don't wanna hear about your disgusting sex anymore."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you just break up with her?
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,Look me in the eye.
Leslie Knope,Look me in the eye and tell me that she's changed.
Leslie Knope,"You said that she was a manipulative monster, and you were right."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, she's in your head."
Leslie Knope,"""Some people like libraries."""
Leslie Knope,I can't even believe what I'm hearing.
Leslie Knope,"Of all the horrifying, miserable things in the world?"
Leslie Knope,"No, he doesn't."
Leslie Knope,"We've had someone throw acid at it, tomato sauce."
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,"God, Ron, you have to."
Leslie Knope,The mural that normally resides here is called The Spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,That's new.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,What was it this time?
Leslie Knope,She works for the library.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Leslie Knope,You can do better than that.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"You didn't kill Tammy, did you?"
Leslie Knope,I know that must've been hard for you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for saving my future park.
Leslie Knope,My legs are shorter than yours.
Leslie Knope,There's a push-pin in your face.
Leslie Knope,Is part of your mustache missing?
Leslie Knope,You didn't give her the lot.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm sure that's not true.
Leslie Knope,Just sign the thing.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"Just, please, find a way to be happy."
Leslie Knope,"So, Ron, you can give her the lot, or don't, whatever."
Leslie Knope,"And you, Tammy, you make him miserable."
Leslie Knope,"I'm here because Ron is my friend, and I don't like seeing my friends miserable."
Leslie Knope,"But no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I had one dream."
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He's completely over you.
Leslie Knope,And I completely understand that.
Leslie Knope,As well as several human lives.
Leslie Knope,"Which one resident described as ""disturbingly enticing."""
Leslie Knope,What do you got there?
Leslie Knope,Chief Konner.
Leslie Knope,Smart.
Leslie Knope,No point of view.
Leslie Knope,You think they're going to win?
Leslie Knope,That was pretty good.
Leslie Knope,Which makes more sense.
Leslie Knope,Better than life in the Sewage Defartment.
Leslie Knope,We're playing it safe.
Leslie Knope,"So, I made a bold decision."
Leslie Knope,But I am the team leader.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are a team."
Leslie Knope,Team dismissed.
Leslie Knope,Go team!
Leslie Knope,"That is an order, team."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the presentation tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,We're going with this one.
Leslie Knope,"You'll feel a lot better, I promise you, after you win."
Leslie Knope,"How great would it be if we won, you guys?"
Leslie Knope,Mark's might win.
Leslie Knope,Our designs are not going to win.
Leslie Knope,That's our reason.
Leslie Knope,We're going to win.
Leslie Knope,We have a reason.
Leslie Knope,Mark's right.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,This is the one.
Leslie Knope,"Well, good luck."
Leslie Knope,I want my team back.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Did you get my proposal for the possible rezoning of Lot 48?
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well."
Leslie Knope,"They're changing the title to ""The Diversity Express."""
Leslie Knope,"So, they're just going to restore the old one."
Leslie Knope,They realized it was going to cost a ton of money to hire a muralist.
Leslie Knope,But neither did anyone else.
Leslie Knope,We didn't win.
Leslie Knope,The Spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"So, there you go."
Leslie Knope,That did not occur to me.
Leslie Knope,"So, he should be going the other way."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, that's because he's moonwalking."
Leslie Knope,Jesus Greg Kinnear.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Let's get in there and show them how Parks gets it done.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,But we're definitely going to lose.
Leslie Knope,"God, I hope we win."
Leslie Knope,Even if it means we lose.
Leslie Knope,"So, this is what we're going to submit."
Leslie Knope,"And my team made this hot, crazy camel mess."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,And it also made the whole town smell like toast.
Leslie Knope,"No, guys."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"He likes the shapes, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"And April, yours was hellish and might make someone vomit."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, yours was a little trite."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you both have a point."
Leslie Knope,Can we all agree on eliminating any of these designs?
Leslie Knope,We need to whittle these down.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"We all voted for ourselves, didn't we?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, the results of the vote, please."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"But there is one winner, us."
Leslie Knope,There are no losers today.
Leslie Knope,And then those six voices came together as a team.
Leslie Knope,"When we started this, we were six different voices with six ideas for a mural."
Leslie Knope,"May the best, most tragic project win."
Leslie Knope,Cast your votes.
Leslie Knope,"Time to vote, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ann gets it."
Leslie Knope,"This is our ""English Patient."""
Leslie Knope,This is our Holocaust movie.
Leslie Knope,Look at the Oscars.
Leslie Knope,And people love voting for tragedy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, because it's the most famous event in our town's history."
Leslie Knope,The point is we rebuilt Pawnee to the wonderful town that it is today.
Leslie Knope,But I digress.
Leslie Knope,And he's part of the team.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,"So, here."
Leslie Knope,And then we'll put them on a new team mural.
Leslie Knope,What are you going to do tonight?
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,"And I really, really want to win this."
Leslie Knope,I know you'll do something good.
Leslie Knope,You're the only one of us who's actually got any talent.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Mark."
Leslie Knope,That everybody stops and looks at.
Leslie Knope,I've seen you sketch things.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are."
Leslie Knope,You have to design something.
Leslie Knope,You have to save us.
Leslie Knope,"We couldn't decide on one design, so we took parts that we all liked of our designs, and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing."
Leslie Knope,This is our entry for the mural contest.
Leslie Knope,We need you to look at a piece of art.
Leslie Knope,But this is just as important.
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We think it might be pills.
Leslie Knope,Ann's in trouble.
Leslie Knope,We need you for something.
Leslie Knope,Brendanawicz!
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.
Leslie Knope,I think it's really good.
Leslie Knope,Imagine how good that painting would be.
Leslie Knope,It's like if you got Michelangelo and Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis from Garfield to do one painting.
Leslie Knope,We're going to make a new design that takes the best parts of all of our designs.
Leslie Knope,Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.
Leslie Knope,"Go, Mom, go."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but the drama."
Leslie Knope,So they sneak out to meet each other and walk on the beach.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go boss. We have a meeting to go to."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Why must it continually turn over?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn the wheel of the world."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I can't believe our little girl's all grown up."
Leslie Knope,That's not what they wrote.
Leslie Knope,"Oh right, Mark. Oh, awkward."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the meeting's at 10:00, come over to my office for champagne after."
Leslie Knope,"Would've taken 13 months if you had agreed to work on weekends, but still, it's great."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it only took us 15 months to do this."
Leslie Knope,"And if it flies, we are going to get our money to build a park."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm presenting it today."
Leslie Knope,Until when?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, you can never have enough."
Leslie Knope,"Jack London, again."
Leslie Knope,"So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry rot."
Leslie Knope,"It's mostly filled with boring, bureaucratic language, so I try to spice it up a little."
Leslie Knope,Isn't that just so awesome you can't stand it?
Leslie Knope,The yearly budget and planning proposal for a city is called the Master Plan.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"With those words ringing in our ears, we proudly present our plans for a new park on municipal lot 48."
Leslie Knope,"In the words of the great 19th century outdoorsman Jack London, you can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for God's sake."
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's nice. I mean it can be a little sentimental to kind of frame things, but its always nice to remember the beginning of something, you know, the start. And when you--"
Leslie Knope,Happy birthday.
Leslie Knope,Me. It's from me.
Leslie Knope,Is there too many Jack London quotes?
Leslie Knope,And when will that end?
Leslie Knope,"So this week, probably?"
Leslie Knope,"""In the event the master plan meeting is cut short"", ""in the event I have laryngitis and I present the master plan"", ""in the event the master plan meeting is moved onto a boat."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I made eye contact with him, and it was like staring into the sun."
Leslie Knope,Chris is the most positive state budget auditing consultant I have ever met.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Would you gentlemen like a tour?
Leslie Knope,I'm Deputy Director Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Death!
Leslie Knope,Maybe these people are very helpful and pleasant.
Leslie Knope,We don't know that.
Leslie Knope,"Relax, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,I'll wait for you to show up.
Leslie Knope,Go do it in your office.
Leslie Knope,"We count backwards from 1,000 by sevens, and we think of warm brownies."
Leslie Knope,Except that I am.
Leslie Knope,I'm not going to fight them.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right."
Leslie Knope,We got to fight these guys.
Leslie Knope,They're going to try to eliminate everything we do.
Leslie Knope,It provides services.
Leslie Knope,"That's what government does, Ron."
Leslie Knope,They're here to slash and burn.
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna come to pat us on the back.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, they're state auditors."
Leslie Knope,Look I'm prepared for every sitautionâ¦ except for the one where there's no master plan.
Leslie Knope,And this is a copy of your very first paycheck.
Leslie Knope,Doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,"Yes. This is your original intern application, your original parking pass. This is your original photo ID."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, open this one. Here, I'll help you."
Leslie Knope,"I know we promised a special event coming up, andâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"And, we need to keep those donations coming in."
Leslie Knope,It's almost 6:00 in the morning.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Enough of that racket.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,So I will now drink eight glasses of milk in three minutes.
Leslie Knope,"Although, is Phoebe there? Yes."
Leslie Knope,"So, Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are all together."
Leslie Knope,What is Ross and Rachel doing? They're fighting.
Leslie Knope,"So, they get ready to eat."
Leslie Knope,And it's Thanksgiving Day.
Leslie Knope,There's a box.
Leslie Knope,I forgot to tell you.
Leslie Knope,"So, Joey says, ""Get in the box."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay. My second favorite episode? Monica is making dinner, and Joey is mad at Chandler because Chandler made out with his girlfriend."
Leslie Knope,What is going to happen next?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Heads.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,Hang in there.
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I really like your shirt.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,"So, I may have parked on your front lawn."
Leslie Knope,"I've just got to tell you, I'm a little tired."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I just I thought maybe you'd want to talk more about all the crazy stuff going on.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Aye-aye, Captain."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm okay."
Leslie Knope,"Morning, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what did I do?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Not on TV.
Leslie Knope,I don't think that that's something Ann wants.
Leslie Knope,I think I was a little tired when I told you that you should do that.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Big man, big check."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look who's here."
Leslie Knope,"When it's for a good cause, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"Okay? On one, two"
Leslie Knope,Everyone's gonna pull their pants down for diabetes.
Leslie Knope,That's what we're going to do.
Leslie Knope,What we're going to do is we're going to pull our pants down.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,There is none.
Leslie Knope,He is one of the best people on the planet.
Leslie Knope,He's universally adored here.
Leslie Knope,How did you know?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"God, I was so jealous of you."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,What was that song you played at the swearing-in ceremony?
Leslie Knope,You were so cute.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Why does that sound familiar? You're Benji Wyatt?
Leslie Knope,Have you ever been part of a government body before?
Leslie Knope,But I don't think you know anything about my department.
Leslie Knope,All three times.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I yelled at you.
Leslie Knope,Mushy.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that tastes really good."
Leslie Knope,Wellâ¦
Leslie Knope,It's like 10:30 in the morning.
Leslie Knope,"You may hold my fate in your hands like a small bird, but I still think you're an ass."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, really."
Leslie Knope,"Look, Ben, I don't appreciate your callous attitude, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"And I was worked up, because obviously, you represent a threat to my department."
Leslie Knope,Twice.
Leslie Knope,"No, what I did was out of line."
Leslie Knope,So I'd like to apologize for yesterday.
Leslie Knope,"I'm here to speak to Ben, actually."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll take one."
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You have a lot of bottles there.
Leslie Knope,You ready?
Leslie Knope,We should have a meeting to about things that happened in secret.
Leslie Knope,So I have a piece of good news.
Leslie Knope,"But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though."
Leslie Knope,"So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Let's not scare the kids.
Leslie Knope,My tongue is swelling up.
Leslie Knope,I'm not an animal.
Leslie Knope,God.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Why did you let me eat that?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,That's bitter.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Smells great.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"For a while, it was a teenage nature hike, but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's in charge of our preteen nature hikes.
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department has so many programs.
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Leslie Knope,I just started hearing really loud circus music in my head.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Meaning what?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"And it contains very practical, deep cuts in many of our services."
Leslie Knope,This suggested plan reduces our overall budget by 35%.
Leslie Knope,We'll talk later.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"All I did was express myself, forcefully, drunkenly. And I spit on him a little bit."
Leslie Knope,Best friends of ever.
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"I love you too, but I need more beer."
Leslie Knope,"I know I had a master plan, and it all blew up in my face, but youâ¦ You came into a town hall meeting, and we met, and we became friends, and that is awesome."
Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, listen to me. Listen to me, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Chug that, bitch!"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Where's our lady?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You want to get super drunk?
Leslie Knope,Again?
Leslie Knope,Where were you earlier when I called?
Leslie Knope,It's just been a really crappy day.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Not necessarily.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I just don't know if I can play God like that-- an angry vengeful God who just fires Jerry for no reason."
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,How can you be so blase about this?
Leslie Knope,Maybe it does.
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of history in this one.
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,You're a jerk.
Leslie Knope,"Well, but Chris said that you just had to, you know, tinker with things."
Leslie Knope,"If you fired him, there would be a revolt."
Leslie Knope,You know what's thirsty?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll go apologize."
Leslie Knope,You know what's weird?
Leslie Knope,When I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't have anything to apologize for."
Leslie Knope,"He's cold and unfeeling, and I yelled at him. So what?"
Leslie Knope,"You know what, he deserves it."
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,Why the yelling?
Leslie Knope,I'll keep an ear to the ground.
Leslie Knope,So it's not Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Ow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Get out of here.
Leslie Knope,"And Ann is right, I should make my own plan, so that you can't hurt us, and that's what I'm gonna do."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it did. You're a cold, callous person, and you want to kill people with machetes."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I just talked to everybody in this bar, and nobody wants you here."
Leslie Knope,"Because this is a party with my friends, and you're trying to fire all my friends."
Leslie Knope,Just get out of here.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Well, save your breath."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Get ready.
Leslie Knope,The one coming over here.
Leslie Knope,That one.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, the jerk, is here."
Leslie Knope,How thirsty I get when I'm weird.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Call me.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, get here now."
Leslie Knope,"All right, team, you guys psyched?"
Leslie Knope,I have you on phone answering duty from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the one?
Leslie Knope,How are things going with Mark?
Leslie Knope,I'm randomly and casually asking.
Leslie Knope,I have not checked in with you lately.
Leslie Knope,She was really into the devil.
Leslie Knope,"""If you take enough rides with the devil, pretty soon, he's going to drive."""
Leslie Knope,"""The devil knows where you're hiding."""
Leslie Knope,"""Tell the truth and shame the devil."""
Leslie Knope,"""Don't put me in a home."""
Leslie Knope,"""Look where it is and you'll find it."""
Leslie Knope,"""Don't work yourself into a lather."""
Leslie Knope,"My nana, she used to say the best stuff."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, my nana used to tell me, ""You'll sleep when you're dead."""
Leslie Knope,But they give me an insane 15 minute burst.
Leslie Knope,They're terrible.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,But I have a secret weapon.
Leslie Knope,I've already been up for 24 hours.
Leslie Knope,I can definitely do it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, they have a communal lipstick and a box of combs."
Leslie Knope,Because he doesn't need to be in hair and makeup until 2:00 a.m.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you know, just entertain him."
Leslie Knope,Pick him up at the airport at 7:00 p.m.
Leslie Knope,And I need you to be his bodyman.
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, all you need to do is take down everybody's name and address and ask them how much they want to donate."
Leslie Knope,"So, it's really exciting."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, then."
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Leslie Knope,"T.B. continued, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"You understand that, right?"
Leslie Knope,He may have a Schrempf problem.
Leslie Knope,It's Tom.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,My slot is coming up.
Leslie Knope,I need to pull it together.
Leslie Knope,I'm up.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,Tigers.
Leslie Knope,There's some secret ingredient in these NutriYum bars that makes me feel so good.
Leslie Knope,Clipboard mouth.
Leslie Knope,Clipboard mouth.
Leslie Knope,Everything is running smoothly.
Leslie Knope,I feel great.
Leslie Knope,Who's next?
Leslie Knope,Right up there.
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, hello."
Leslie Knope,I'm tired already.
Leslie Knope,What time is it?
Leslie Knope,It's exciting.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Figure it out, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,You got the most lines.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Four hours to embroider them.
Leslie Knope,Four hours to come up with the slogan.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Boom.
Leslie Knope,And here's why.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night last night making these.
Leslie Knope,It will get you in the mood.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you put on one of these Tshirts?
Leslie Knope,From 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Leslie Knope,Tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to answer phones and provide moral support."
Leslie Knope,"So, I have signed you all up for multiple shifts."
Leslie Knope,Exciting!
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this year, I get to program my own four hour block."
Leslie Knope,"It goes us, Dallas, Tulsa and certain parts of The Mall of America."
Leslie Knope,"And it's important, because Pawnee is the fourth fattest town in the U.S."
Leslie Knope,"Every year, Pawnee Cares teams up with the local cable access station to raise money for diabetes research."
Leslie Knope,Because the 24 hour Pawnee Cares Diabetes Telethon starts tonight.
Leslie Knope,In my belly.
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Can we keep him?
Leslie Knope,Puppy!
Leslie Knope,Is it weird if I ask to take a piece of cake with me? I won't.
Leslie Knope,Salad sucks.
Leslie Knope,"Ex- lndiana Pacers small forward, Detlef Schrempf."
Leslie Knope,There.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to guess.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,People are going to freak out.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to believe who I got.
Leslie Knope,You're in charge of the VIP special telethon guest.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, you're in for tonight, right?"
Leslie Knope,Get as many eagles as you want.
Leslie Knope,It's your life.
Leslie Knope,"No, you're right."
Leslie Knope,"No, get ten eagles."
Leslie Knope,Can you get five eagles?
Leslie Knope,Definitely.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they have to repeat that story for the rest of their lives."
Leslie Knope,How you ask someone to marry you is a very big deal.
Leslie Knope,"She's in the balloon, you ride up on horseback, you point to the sky, up there, skywriting, ""Marry me, Ann."""
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"She should be on the hot air balloon, and you should ride up on horseback."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, you should ask her in a hot air balloon."
Leslie Knope,You should ask her on horseback.
Leslie Knope,Horseback.
Leslie Knope,Is something wrong?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I said it.
Leslie Knope,I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Are you on your way?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Was she on the Titanic?
Leslie Knope,Was she on the Titanic?
Leslie Knope,Is there a story behind it?
Leslie Knope,And I don't think we can get a hot air balloon at this time of night.
Leslie Knope,We talked about it being something big.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, butâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Most women do.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Don't you remember when Ahmad Rashad proposed to Mrs. Cosby on TV?
Leslie Knope,It would be so cool.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,For diabetes.
Leslie Knope,On camera.
Leslie Knope,Whatever it is.
Leslie Knope,Today.
Leslie Knope,I think you should propose to Ann tonight.
Leslie Knope,I have a great idea.
Leslie Knope,Maybe Mark and Ann wouldâ¦
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Hot people kissing?
Leslie Knope,No time to train one.
Leslie Knope,Cute animals on a bike?
Leslie Knope,What do people want to watch?
Leslie Knope,"I have no Schrempf, no backup plan, no more NutriYum bars."
Leslie Knope,I am completely screwed.
Leslie Knope,This is a disaster.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, Barney, for that."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,We'd like to make a quick announcement.
Leslie Knope,Can you call me back?
Leslie Knope,Change of plans.
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Leslie Knope,"Good for you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Why would you do that?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I guess you're just going to have to marry him and figure it out.
Leslie Knope,I think he's ready to take this to the next step.
Leslie Knope,Mark really loves you.
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,What did you want to talk to me about?
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry that I've been crazy.
Leslie Knope,Just stay a little while longer.
Leslie Knope,Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"For now, please, let's take a look at this moving video entitled, One Butt, Two Seats: The Widening of America."
Leslie Knope,"Or get your tissues out, if you're like me and think handkerchiefs are gross."
Leslie Knope,"So, get your wallets out or get your handkerchiefs out."
Leslie Knope,"But coming soon, a really amazing thing is going to happen."
Leslie Knope,Detlef Schrempf is temporarily delayed.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,This is really serious!
Leslie Knope,You don't have a second egg?
Leslie Knope,Let's call them.
Leslie Knope,I'm tired of waiting for people to call us.
Leslie Knope,"God, we're not getting any donations coming in."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'd like to donate 50 dollars, please."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"When my shift is done, that board is going to read 20,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,See that board?
Leslie Knope,But we're back on track.
Leslie Knope,Slight hiccup.
Leslie Knope,"Well, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mouse Rat."
Leslie Knope,"But until then, I would like to introduce one of the hottest bands in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Indiana Pacers legend, Detlef Schrempf, will be joining us in the studio later on."
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of fun stuff coming up.
Leslie Knope,"And tonight, God willing, we will all be stricken with that."
Leslie Knope,Type One caring.
Leslie Knope,"There are two types of diabetes, but only one type of caring."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"So, how are things going with you two?"
Leslie Knope,You're kicking things off.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I know I told you that you were going on at 3:00 a.m. after the Detlef Schrempf interview and career retrospective, but you're going on now."
Leslie Knope,Problem.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Get him here.
Leslie Knope,But you promised to get him here.
Leslie Knope,That's awesome.
Leslie Knope,Everybody call somebody.
Leslie Knope,Why are you wasting my time?
Leslie Knope,"Then, good."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, someone good?"
Leslie Knope,Go up there and do that.
Leslie Knope,It's real.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, that's disgusting and fake!"
Leslie Knope,Nod your head yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"April, will you call some of the Rec Center teachers and see if they want to come down and show off their special skills?"
Leslie Knope,Attaboy.
Leslie Knope,Help me.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,I need you to wake up.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Don't go back to sleep.
Leslie Knope,And I have three hours to fill.
Leslie Knope,"Tom is not here, and he's got Detlef Schrempf."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm freaking out, okay?"
Leslie Knope,That must be terrible.
Leslie Knope,Were you having a bad dream?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, wake up."
Leslie Knope,Wake up.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, has anyone seen Tom?"
Leslie Knope,You're not supposed to receive personal phone calls.
Leslie Knope,They'll be home.
Leslie Knope,"She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,It is a classic strategy.
Leslie Knope,"Hopefully! Okay, back to work!"
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a chance to get porta-potties so the audience are gonna have to use Ann's house for the bathrooms.
Leslie Knope,"All right, so-- Oh I forgot."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Everybody ready?
Leslie Knope,But it is gonna make a lot of people happy.
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna make all the problems in our town go away.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna put on a show today.
Leslie Knope,"We're so glad you're here, thanks for coming."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,We need to give him the star treatment.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, after this, can you go pick up Freddy Spaghetti in your Mercedes?"
Leslie Knope,Needs 16 minutes for premium bounce.
Leslie Knope,Hit it.
Leslie Knope,Crank it.
Leslie Knope,Hammering away.
Leslie Knope,With or without you.
Leslie Knope,"We're going to do this, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Watch me.
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put on the Freddy Spaghetti concert today, 5:00 on Lot 48."
Leslie Knope,I love it enough for both of us.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if you hate what we do.
Leslie Knope,Can you make us some more pancakes?
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,You're here.
Leslie Knope,"So, go out there and get the equipment out of the truck."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish we had built one of those elevators that comes up from under the stage, you know?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,We have a solution.
Leslie Knope,"See, guys?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, just take the word ""sex"" and change it to ""pickle."""
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, please."
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,He's not the only musician in town.
Leslie Knope,We're not giving up on this.
Leslie Knope,Guys?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,I think.
Leslie Knope,But something much cooler is going to happen.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti may not sing.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti will sing.
Leslie Knope,Everyone here believes that what we're doing is essential.
Leslie Knope,Everything was donated for free by local vendors.
Leslie Knope,Because the stage is already built.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,We're putting it on.
Leslie Knope,It's not canceled.
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, though, Ben."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Just be cool.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, be cool."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,"And the good news is there's always a solution if your motives are pure, and your cause is just."
Leslie Knope,Being a wuss?
Leslie Knope,I didn't think you were going to help.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You're about to have sex.
Leslie Knope,Is this a bad time?
Leslie Knope,I need your help.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanaquitz.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I guess I've been mispronouncing your name all these years."
Leslie Knope,How could you quit?
Leslie Knope,I know I shouldn't have done that.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,What should I do about this?
Leslie Knope,You know everything.
Leslie Knope,But what I can't stand is they're canceling Freddy Spaghetti.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this budget crisis.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this government shutdown.
Leslie Knope,This isn't me.
Leslie Knope,This?
Leslie Knope,That is not your call.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is better than Idaho.
Leslie Knope,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, let's talk solutions."
Leslie Knope,Can you put a price tag on a child's smile?
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,You're wrong.
Leslie Knope,"I just want to give you a little advice, which is don't make it last really long."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, how do you feel about lifting heavy things?"
Leslie Knope,Ladies don't like that.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,"Move, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,April is here.
Leslie Knope,"God bless you, Jerry Gergich!"
Leslie Knope,"Although, D, maybe not."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, they're definitely going to show up."
Leslie Knope,"But C, yes."
Leslie Knope,"B, even if they don't, we'll just put the concert on ourselves."
Leslie Knope,"A, yes."
Leslie Knope,I told them to be here by 8:00.
Leslie Knope,And I sent up the Bat Signal for all the people in the Parks Department to come and join us.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've spent the last three hours coming up with a plan."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you devious bastard."
Leslie Knope,That's the way it is.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what are you going to do?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee's kids are less important than poop tubes.
Leslie Knope,Sewage.
Leslie Knope,You know what is?
Leslie Knope,Children's concerts aren't a priority these days.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti.
Leslie Knope,"The only guy that I care about right now is six feet tall with wild, crazy hair and a ukulele that doubles as a water gun."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Less man time, more Ann time."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Are you using protection?
Leslie Knope,Just one more thing.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing--
Leslie Knope,Can Mouse Rat play without you?
Leslie Knope,Did he ask you out again?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Go the other way.
Leslie Knope,But don't expect me to sit here and chitchat with you.
Leslie Knope,"I know you don't have faith in me and my department, and that's fine."
Leslie Knope,Save it.
Leslie Knope,There was a whole line of people in my office complaining that all their programs have been slashed.
Leslie Knope,"Not good, Chris."
Leslie Knope,"I need to be out in the streets, planting trees and cracking skulls."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not a paper pusher, Ann."
Leslie Knope,It's like they don't have faith in us anymore.
Leslie Knope,"Winter Jamboree, the Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, when we were kids, the Parks Department would do these big projects."
Leslie Knope,We literally can't buy shit.
Leslie Knope,Request denied.
Leslie Knope,I tried to buy fertilizer the other day for the soccer field.
Leslie Knope,"Well, our budget's been slashed to zero."
Leslie Knope,It says here you only have money for two teams?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're color coded, for God's sake."
Leslie Knope,And I have some really great ideas and I put them in my idea binders.
Leslie Knope,"See, I've spent the last few months brainstorming."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,"No, make this town fun for the people who live here."
Leslie Knope,And we have a job to do.
Leslie Knope,But we are all still here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Park services have been slashed.
Leslie Knope,I just thought of an idea of how we can save the Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,Would you be cool doing things that a prostitute does?
Leslie Knope,Just like the budget needs to pop open and you need to pour it into my Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"And... Oops, my vest popped open."
Leslie Knope,I would like some wine.
Leslie Knope,I'm wearing a tuxedo vest with no shirt on underneath.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'll show you how it's done.
Leslie Knope,I'll be you.
Leslie Knope,You be Chris.
Leslie Knope,Tell you what.
Leslie Knope,It's totally easy.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Turkey chili.
Leslie Knope,"No, you know what's sexy?"
Leslie Knope,Asparagus?
Leslie Knope,"Well, what's sexy food?"
Leslie Knope,Like a banana.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but you're going to have to eat something sexy, then."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Fingerless gloves.
Leslie Knope,You know what's always sexy?
Leslie Knope,Do you have any of those shirts that look wet all the time?
Leslie Knope,"I like what you're wearing, but I need it to be 300% sexier."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Minus the money?
Leslie Knope,Let me ask you one question.
Leslie Knope,How soon until he's better?
Leslie Knope,We are operating on a shoestring budget.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So you'll never forget your roots.
Leslie Knope,Red tape.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,I got you a going away present.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I called you Mark Brendana-quitz.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would say see you tomorrow, butâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"You guys are the best, most important people in the most important government in the best city in the world."
Leslie Knope,"Me, too!"
Leslie Knope,"And what was your favorite song, Chelsea?"
Leslie Knope,And they love it.
Leslie Knope,A service.
Leslie Knope,"Just... Can you just stop it? Okay? Just for one moment, enjoy the fact that you provided a service for people, not a cut."
Leslie Knope,"No. No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,Mean Ben has a soft spot.
Leslie Knope,Why did you do this?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I thought you were playing in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"If you're happy and you know it, Clap your hands, If you're happy and you know itâ¦"
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,It was really scary.
Leslie Knope,It was just streaming out of his face.
Leslie Knope,There was sauce everywhere.
Leslie Knope,He bumped his noodle.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti couldn't make it today.
Leslie Knope,I'm Renata Ricotta.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Here's the situation.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, Pawnee's bankrupt."
Leslie Knope,"Break's over, mofos."
Leslie Knope,Come on!
Leslie Knope,You're not going to need this anymore.
Leslie Knope,We're going back to work.
Leslie Knope,"The nightmare's over, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,We're back.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, we're back."
Leslie Knope,Feel.
Leslie Knope,I have goose bumps.
Leslie Knope,"Rounding up the team, so exciting."
Leslie Knope,I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
Leslie Knope,"The bankrupt government of Pawnee has been shut down all summer, so it's been three months of no work, no meetings, no memos, no late nights, nothing."
Leslie Knope,We're back.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Cut it out, Tom."
Leslie Knope,I am the pants queen!
Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Leslie Knope,I have so many ideas.
Leslie Knope,"So, shall we get started?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Essential personnel?
Leslie Knope,Ron made me the official Parks and Rec representative for the budget discussions.
Leslie Knope,Morning.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,I doubt I'll get to build a park anytime soon.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,May all your future gazebos live long and prosper.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,"I'm very glad that you agree with me, but I actually worked really hard on my argument."
Leslie Knope,So I didn't quite know how to answer that.
Leslie Knope,We don't always meet here.
Leslie Knope,We meet at a bunch of different places.
Leslie Knope,Sure we can.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"It's actually called a subcommittee, not a committee, so."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,That way it's verbatim.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,And Andy is the citizen who fell in it.
Leslie Knope,Ann was the citizen who brought the pit to our attention.
Leslie Knope,They're the real heroes of this story.
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we've got Ann Perkins and Andy Dwyer."
Leslie Knope,Cool enough to be invited anywhere and chooses to be here.
Leslie Knope,"April Ludgate, 19."
Leslie Knope,Smooth like milk chocolate.
Leslie Knope,"Tom Haverford, boy genius."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Shauna, this is our crack team."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is the reporter I was telling you about."
Leslie Knope,"This is Ron Swanson, our boss."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we get letters every day."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, tons of people have."
Leslie Knope,I am always amazed at his quiet dignity right before he's killed by a cannonball.
Leslie Knope,It was painted in 1936 and this is Chief Wamapo and he was convicted of crimes against the soldiers.
Leslie Knope,"And this is called ""The trial of Chief Wamapo."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,So there are 10 murals here in this hallway.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna be in my office.
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to complain, but I think Shauna is being a little unprofessional."
Leslie Knope,"No, sorry."
Leslie Knope,So he gave you a ride somehow?
Leslie Knope,Do you live near Mark?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no problem."
Leslie Knope,"Over there as well, so I think you're fine."
Leslie Knope,This is a great place to take a shot.
Leslie Knope,There's a beautiful view from over there.
Leslie Knope,Disaster averted.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Please fix it.
Leslie Knope,"Shauna is in the conference room, and she's writing a really bad article and it's gonna destroy us all."
Leslie Knope,And it turns out that Ann is on birth control pills.
Leslie Knope,Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit.
Leslie Knope,"But then, Ann and Andy sandbagged me."
Leslie Knope,I tried to stay on message.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, thank you for coming."
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,"The press are like sharks, and you guys just dumped a bucket of chum in the water."
Leslie Knope,You're so sweet and innocent and pretty.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Stay on message.
Leslie Knope,Such a tragedy.
Leslie Knope,Because these are the real heroes.
Leslie Knope,She got here 15 minutes late. She's wearing the same dress she wore yesterday.
Leslie Knope,Quick tour?
Leslie Knope,They are nature's bandits.
Leslie Knope,"So, listen, I was hoping maybe I could pick your brain about how to deal with the media."
Leslie Knope,The people who eat here basically run this town.
Leslie Knope,"This is JJ's Diner, the unofficial meeting place of Pawnee's political elite."
Leslie Knope,Buy you a cup of coffee?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark?"
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Stay on what, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Stay on message and stay on message.
Leslie Knope,It's one and two.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's that important."
Leslie Knope,Stay on message again?
Leslie Knope,Number two: What?
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,And that's it.
Leslie Knope,"All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park."
Leslie Knope,This is key.
Leslie Knope,"Rule number one, stay on message."
Leslie Knope,"Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media."
Leslie Knope,One penis in particular.
Leslie Knope,"To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises."
Leslie Knope,"We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding."
Leslie Knope,The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project."
Leslie Knope,"You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die."
Leslie Knope,The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.
Leslie Knope,It's my first interview.
Leslie Knope,"So, can I give you a quick tour before we get started?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I don't count that.
Leslie Knope,And I agree with you.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Who left the door open?
Leslie Knope,You did an amazing in-depth article on the raccoon problem here in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,I've read everything you've ever written.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am familiar with your work."
Leslie Knope,Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,I'm the deputy director of Parks and Recreation.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,My ears are ringing.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,And it was very intense.
Leslie Knope,Mark and I made love once.
Leslie Knope,You're insane.
Leslie Knope,Um Thirty.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now should I give her a tour of the building--"
Leslie Knope,You're so smart.
Leslie Knope,"Because of the silent ""K."""
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,What is she gonna ask me first?
Leslie Knope,What do you think her opening gambit is gonna be?
Leslie Knope,Can I run them by you?
Leslie Knope,So I put together some discussion topics.
Leslie Knope,That was a smear job.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Is there any way I can still kind of... Yeah?
Leslie Knope,And she had to get a ride from--
Leslie Knope,How big is what?
Leslie Knope,Thank you a lot.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, subcommittee member Mark Brendanawicz."
Leslie Knope,"Mark, can I ask you a question? You didn't really believe it when you said that the park was never gonna get made, right?"
Leslie Knope,You'll have my answer within the month.
Leslie Knope,Would you like to be reinstated onto our subcommittee?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I appreciate you trying."
Leslie Knope,It's over.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm writing an op-ed piece about media ethics for the Pawnee Journal, so, yeah, I'm a little busy."
Leslie Knope,Might I ask who said that?
Leslie Knope,That's--
Leslie Knope,Why would you write an article about that?
Leslie Knope,Leprechauns exist.
Leslie Knope,Have you seen The Wizard of Oz?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,There are some countries where the Pope can be married.
Leslie Knope,Tell that to a 14 year old girl.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree."
Leslie Knope,"Well, until it turns into a park."
Leslie Knope,Be my guest.
Leslie Knope,Because I would be lying if I said less.
Leslie Knope,Can I say over 100%?
Leslie Knope,"It's just, we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wouldn't say weird."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the article came out, and it was a mixed bag."
Leslie Knope,"So, look, I feel like I may have gone a little off message at the pit."
Leslie Knope,"""An abandoned lot on Sullivan Street has been proposed as the site of a new park."""
Leslie Knope,I think we stayed on message for that part.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"And this year, the concert has been canceled due to the shutdown."
Leslie Knope,"Every year, we kick off the summer with a children's concert series."
Leslie Knope,And it is Pawnee's children.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I believe there has been a casualty of war in this government shutdown, and it saddens me."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Chris."
Leslie Knope,And I for one do not like having Freddy Spaghetti's blood on my hands.
Leslie Knope,It's not a waste to provide fun for kids.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope you're happy."
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti has been canceled.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to tell you.
Leslie Knope,One thing at a time.
Leslie Knope,The point is I would win.
Leslie Knope,But that's neither here nor there.
Leslie Knope,"Because if it was, I would win."
Leslie Knope,Not like it's a competition or anything.
Leslie Knope,"Look, no one is more upset about this than I am."
Leslie Knope,All I can tell you is that all the parks are closed until further notice.
Leslie Knope,Ends on a hopeful note.
Leslie Knope,"She writes, and I quote, ""We'll see."""
Leslie Knope,At the end.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and right here."
Leslie Knope,JJ's Diner gets a nice mention.
Leslie Knope,"I didn't ""throw up,"" I spit up."
Leslie Knope,"""Pretty drunk, Ann's on the pill."""
Leslie Knope,And then it gets a little unpleasant.
Leslie Knope,That part's good.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the best thing on the menu."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?
Leslie Knope,"But I decided to leave in the middle of it 'cause I figured I nailed it so why push it, right?"
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was going perfect."
Leslie Knope,"I was doing an interview at the pit, and it was going really well."
Leslie Knope,You're home.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"No, it wasn't."
Leslie Knope,"But-- Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, technically, yes, it was nepotism."
Leslie Knope,Crap on a stick.
Leslie Knope,It's not like it was nepotism.
Leslie Knope,I was qualified.
Leslie Knope,My mother got me the job.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was a few years ago."
Leslie Knope,I have to get something from my car.
Leslie Knope,I don't I guess I don't know anything.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Shauna Malwae-Tweep."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Give or take 100.
Leslie Knope,A hundred or something.
Leslie Knope,How big is the lot?
Leslie Knope,You tell me.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it wasn't a Mexican burrito."
Leslie Knope,"No, just your kind of standard questions."
Leslie Knope,She and Mark had sex with each other.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I'm buying.
Leslie Knope,Maybe over lunch.
Leslie Knope,"So, I was hoping we could have a do over interview."
Leslie Knope,I was acting strange at the pit and the reason is because I had food poisoning from an old burrito.
Leslie Knope,I accidentally ate an old burrito.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hi."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is deputy director of Parks and Recreation--"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I can't allow that kind of behavior from someone serving on my subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have sex with her and"
Leslie Knope,Especially when you have sex with someone who is so skanky.
Leslie Knope,It's unethical and it's irresponsible for a public servant to have sex with a member of the press corps.
Leslie Knope,It has come to my attention that you had sex with Ms. Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,Something's come to my attention that requires your attention.
Leslie Knope,I need to speak with you about something very sensitive.
Leslie Knope,May I come into your office?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mark."
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Make sure that he didn't say anything to hurt the project.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should go talk to him."
Leslie Knope,He doesn't like her.
Leslie Knope,Why can't they be professionals?
Leslie Knope,Why do men have to behave like this?
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep and Mark Brendanawicz had sex with each other last night.
Leslie Knope,They did it.
Leslie Knope,"I wish I was, but I'm not."
Leslie Knope,There was one annoying thing.
Leslie Knope,How's this for a headline?
Leslie Knope,"So, I would like to apologize and raise a glass to change and forgiveness and the future and Ann and Mark, and happiness and Nick Newport Sr."
Leslie Knope,I am the gate lady.
Leslie Knope,Am I quite sure?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Am I sure the possum we caught is Fairway Frank?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right."
Leslie Knope,Because my best ideas usually come to me at night.
Leslie Knope,What time do you usually go to sleep?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Laminated bus pass?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,How about an extra recycling can?
Leslie Knope,Which one should I choose?
Leslie Knope,I need so many special favors.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I will!"
Leslie Knope,Task force.
Leslie Knope,"This is Andy Dwyer, he actually caught the thing."
Leslie Knope,I was just the simple mastermind who planned the whole operation and executed it to perfection.
Leslie Knope,I had a great task force.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"You're next, Poopy."
Leslie Knope,"All right, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, okay, okay!"
Leslie Knope,We got him!
Leslie Knope,That's him!
Leslie Knope,That's him!
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,Am I sure enough?
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"If it wasn't Fairway Frank, would I feel badly?"
Leslie Knope,I saw a second possum!
Leslie Knope,"The point is, if I kill the first whale, am I technically a murderer?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a submarine with a face painted on it.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a big fish.
Leslie Knope,"But then you thought, maybe it's not a whale."
Leslie Knope,"And while you were catching the whale, you saw something else that may also be another whale, and you were like, ""What?"""
Leslie Knope,"Hypothetically, if you were going on a mission to, say, catch a guilty whale."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April, can I talk to you about this situation with the possum?"
Leslie Knope,Nobody cares about this very much.
Leslie Knope,"So, this isn't a really big story, right?"
Leslie Knope,"In fact, there may be some big news on that front coming soon, all because of this very important business card."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we're making really good progress on the park."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,Of the possum.
Leslie Knope,"So, for right now, let's just refer to it as a possum."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we see a possum that we believe to be Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,"You remember Shauna Malwee-Tweep, from the Pawnee Journal?"
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,Uhâ¦
Leslie Knope,Does doing so help me make decisions?
Leslie Knope,"As a city official, it's important that I ask myself a lot of questions."
Leslie Knope,That depends.
Leslie Knope,Could I live with myself?
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Let me see his face!
Leslie Knope,Let me see his face.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, you cowards!"
Leslie Knope,"Task force, engage!"
Leslie Knope,Office.
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is not a request."
Leslie Knope,Today's Wednesday.
Leslie Knope,"Boy, we have a really important job for you."
Leslie Knope,Eugene!
Leslie Knope,Ron will show you around.
Leslie Knope,"Ma'am, the next time we speak, we shall be dancing on the grave of a possum."
Leslie Knope,A task force?
Leslie Knope,They're a bunch of burned out morons.
Leslie Knope,"And he's actually number three on the Parks Department's Most Wanted Pest List, right behind the bats, who like to poop on the bell tower, and Poopy, the raccoon who poops all over the high school cafeteria."
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank is this awful possum who lives near the sixth hole of the public golf course.
Leslie Knope,It was Fairway Frank.
Leslie Knope,Rufus was bitten by a possum?
Leslie Knope,Continue.
Leslie Knope,He's a great dog.
Leslie Knope,Everybody loves Rufus.
Leslie Knope,We all know Rufus.
Leslie Knope,Rufus.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,What can I do for you?
Leslie Knope,Meeting you.
Leslie Knope,I've always dreamed of you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello!"
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Figures.
Leslie Knope,I need your two best guys to join me and be part of my task force.
Leslie Knope,There was another possum!
Leslie Knope,"Listen, that stupid possum is on the golf course again."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,Andy will come in to--
Leslie Knope,I'll flank the right.
Leslie Knope,"You two, flank the left."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we may only get one chance to catch this thing, so we have to play it smart."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I want you to very slowlyâ¦"
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,It's Fairway Frank!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"You have to get up early, hit the range, practice reading greens."
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, it takes a lot of practice."
Leslie Knope,I have a 16 handicap.
Leslie Knope,I could teach you.
Leslie Knope,Resume golfing.
Leslie Knope,Task force clear.
Leslie Knope,Task force coming through!
Leslie Knope,Excuse us!
Leslie Knope,How hard can it be?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, there's five of us and only one possum."
Leslie Knope,Come with me.
Leslie Knope,Want your ball back?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you want your ball back?"
Leslie Knope,Cool!
Leslie Knope,"Would you rather I capture it myself, and then just call you, so you can come and pick it up?"
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank's been haunting the sixth hole for a while now.
Leslie Knope,You must know him pretty well.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Campopiano, those are photos of three different possums."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're so small."
Leslie Knope,"Scientifically, hummingbirds are the world's cutest animals."
Leslie Knope,"I installed hummingbird feeders in all the parks, so the winner gets to refill those feeders."
Leslie Knope,"No, they don't win a hummingbird."
Leslie Knope,Write your name down on a piece of paper.
Leslie Knope,You know how it works.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Time for the hummingbird lottery.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, Ann! I love you!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay? April, run! Run, April."
Leslie Knope,We captured it and it got out and it ran around and it was a possum.
Leslie Knope,It's our fault.
Leslie Knope,"And it went into your laundry and your kitchen, and it touched all your bras and I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,We captured a possum and we brought it into your house and it got out and it might have laid eggs in your bed.
Leslie Knope,There was a possum.
Leslie Knope,Possum.
Leslie Knope,"And I want to be wearing a huge, beautiful, blue hat!"
Leslie Knope,"When I retire and I'm attending some gala honoring the first three female presidents in history, myself and two other women I've inspired, I want to be looking back at my distinguished legacy and not thinking that I owe my career to some possum."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look."
Leslie Knope,Honestly.
Leslie Knope,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm proud to say that it's somewhere the mayor can never pee on it."
Leslie Knope,"You didn't have to say that, you could've just thought it."
Leslie Knope,"And, April, any time you want to talk about boys--"
Leslie Knope,We can just call Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,We don't have to call Andy.
Leslie Knope,And they have tiny beaks.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,And they only eat sugar water.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Unless somebody has another good one.
Leslie Knope,That's enough.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,How long does it take to fill bird feeders?
Leslie Knope,Why isn't he back?
Leslie Knope,"Where is Jerry, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,"And he didn't OD, his drummer shot him."
Leslie Knope,That's Mr. Funny Noodle.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we are going to kick off the Children's Concert Series this weekend with a performance by Freddy Spaghetti."
Leslie Knope,"But just to be safe, I do add 20 extra ""Jerry""s."
Leslie Knope,"No, I always write my own name."
Leslie Knope,You can stop by tomorrow morning before work.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Who's it going to be?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Baby monkeys in diapers are the cutest.
Leslie Knope,They do.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Baby monkeys in diapers?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what beats that?"
Leslie Knope,Who do I speak to about getting this changed?
Leslie Knope,He'll forgive you.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's so--"
Leslie Knope,Everybody look over here! I need everyone's full attention during this.
Leslie Knope,Everybody look at it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look how much it's bleeding."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Help! Help, my arm looks like it's bleeding!"
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of can'ts in my life right now.
Leslie Knope,"I can't make a good soup, can't do a handstand in a pool, can't spell the word ""lieutenant."""
Leslie Knope,"I can't let the possum go, because it might be guilty."
Leslie Knope,"I can't kill the possum, because it might be innocent."
Leslie Knope,"Please, April, tell me you can do it!"
Leslie Knope,Can you do it?
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do it?"
Leslie Knope,Can you sneak it out of here?
Leslie Knope,Can you get the possum out of here?
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do that?"
Leslie Knope,"Can you do that, April?"
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna distract everybody and then you get that possum out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,We need a little bit more time to figure out the truth.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,They're gonna take it away.
Leslie Knope,Those idiots are here from Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, Evelyn, we're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,Does he want to have sex with a dead possum?
Leslie Knope,Ew!
Leslie Knope,"He tackled it once before, he can do it again."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna call Andy.
Leslie Knope,It's so huge.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there, there are no eggs! You know, we should've killed it."
Leslie Knope,What if it's in here?
Leslie Knope,"I know there's a door there, but I kind of feel like it's going to chew through the door and come and jump on my face and bite me."
Leslie Knope,All right? Let's just go outside! Get in here!
Leslie Knope,"Here's what we do, we just go outside."
Leslie Knope,"No! Okay, where did it go?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Let me just think for a second.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna fix this.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! How did this happen?"
Leslie Knope,"April! April, it's Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,How would you feel if you killed an innocent duck and let a vicious goose waddle free?
Leslie Knope,"No, it's awful, Tom."
Leslie Knope,But security footage later revealed that it was actually a goose.
Leslie Knope,"And in Walnut Creek, California, they put down a duck that bit a kid."
Leslie Knope,They put down a raccoon that bit a jogger in a park in Staten Island.
Leslie Knope,This is interesting.
Leslie Knope,"But I'm going to stop talking now because I'm afraid I may accidentally say where it is, so please go."
Leslie Knope,"And I will not reveal his location, no matter how much you ask me."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but he's somewhere you'll never find it and he's gonna stay there until the truth comes out."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll take it."
Leslie Knope,I'm being ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,And you should win it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, he cried himself to sleep."
Leslie Knope,"He's a loon, Justin."
Leslie Knope,I don't feel right about this.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Frank.
Leslie Knope,Frank.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Frank, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,I have a purse.
Leslie Knope,A what?
Leslie Knope,"Frank, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,So you were in the military?
Leslie Knope,"So, Frank, where have you been for the past 40 years?"
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Leslie Knope,Look how young she is.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Did that work out?
Leslie Knope,My mom always said that you wanted to be a lawyer.
Leslie Knope,"Frank, I was wondering."
Leslie Knope,I'm not Marlene.
Leslie Knope,"PooPaw, no."
Leslie Knope,PooPaw.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't know why you're pushing."
Leslie Knope,I feel like I've known him my whole life.
Leslie Knope,Why do you want him to spend time with my mom?
Leslie Knope,I don't like this.
Leslie Knope,"Could you just share the field with the girls today, please?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Every child has the right to play, no matter how boring the sport."
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Apparently, the girls' team does not have a field assigned to them for practice, but the boys' team does."
Leslie Knope,Excellent role modeling.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"You're not only coaches, you're also role models."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is no way for adults to act in front of children."
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,There's something about the way he treats people or something.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,But he acted like a real jerk today.
Leslie Knope,"My boyfriend is a lawyer, and he's smart and interesting, and there's a lot of things about him I like."
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry we brought him here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mom, are you okay? Did Frank leave?"
Leslie Knope,Do you think we should stand by--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"One that we'd love to tell you over a cup of coffee, somewhere far from this place."
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,Mom.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I'm breathing.
Leslie Knope,"What happens is, I drive him home."
Leslie Knope,I'm calling this off.
Leslie Knope,I don't think this is gonna work.
Leslie Knope,How would that help her?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Frank Beckerson.
Leslie Knope,I really want you to be happy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, hello there."
Leslie Knope,Where am I going?
Leslie Knope,That is the Terminator.
Leslie Knope,This meeting has been terminated.
Leslie Knope,"No, JFK."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Ask not what your old people could do for you, ask what you could do for your old people."
Leslie Knope,You got drafted.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, too bad."
Leslie Knope,"Finally, Ann and Mark are our special volunteers, and they will be available whenever needed."
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,"And Jerry, who knows."
Leslie Knope,"Divorced, dating a gay guy, divorced twice, jury's still out on you two."
Leslie Knope,"And no offense, but everybody here is terrible at love."
Leslie Knope,Some of them have been married for half a century.
Leslie Knope,"It isn't just a job, gang, we're gonna learn a lot from these seniors."
Leslie Knope,"The Senior Center Valentine's Dance is tomorrow, from 5:00 to 9:00."
Leslie Knope,Great news.
Leslie Knope,"Troops, gather around."
Leslie Knope,"But if you find him and he's weird, like a ventriloquist, or a puppeteer, or anyone who pretends toys are people, then abort the mission."
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,He's probably married or dead.
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"And then they lost touch, and a few years later she met my dad."
Leslie Knope,"But her parents thought she was too young, so she said no."
Leslie Knope,"And two weeks later, he asked her to marry him and move to Illinois."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Stay away from John Mayer.
Leslie Knope,You guys sound ready for the dance tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"These songs are exactly like the songs you usually play, except instead of modern rock, they're old jazzy standards from the '40s."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jen."
Leslie Knope,Or Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston?
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that you could reunite Romeo and Juliet?
Leslie Knope,How often do you get to reunite soul mates?
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna call him ""PooPaw."""
Leslie Knope,I'm getting ahead of myself.
Leslie Knope,Look at me.
Leslie Knope,PawPaw?
Leslie Knope,Poppy?
Leslie Knope,Pop?
Leslie Knope,"Maybe I'll call him ""Pappy."""
Leslie Knope,"No, that'd be too much."
Leslie Knope,"Would I call him ""Dad"" then?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, what if they get married?"
Leslie Knope,Do you think they'll get married?
Leslie Knope,Explain what?
Leslie Knope,Which is a cute word.
Leslie Knope,For our nooner.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're planning to leave around noon, so I'm not quite sure--"
Leslie Knope,Justin and I need to go on a romantically inspired road trip.
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I need a half a day off for a secret mission of love."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do great.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Think of it this way.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, is Jerry okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,Another organization giving you credit for something you didn't do?
Leslie Knope,"I swear to God, I would--"
Leslie Knope,Dorothy Everton Smythe.
Leslie Knope,"Twenty-six certificates , plaques, ribbons, trophies, medals and miscellany certifying that I am the kind of person who deserves recognition for her achievements."
Leslie Knope,That's not really the attitude I'd expect from an award winner.
Leslie Knope,"Take care of that, did you?"
Leslie Knope,How's the scheduling conflict with the soccer teams going?
Leslie Knope,Work that often goes unrewarded.
Leslie Knope,Because some of us actually do work around here.
Leslie Knope,Did you need me?
Leslie Knope,IOW.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
Leslie Knope,But I'm going to make a point!
Leslie Knope,Because I love it!
Leslie Knope,"If you don't get credit for your work, why bother doing it?"
Leslie Knope,Go on in there.
Leslie Knope,He's the guy that's gonna help you out.
Leslie Knope,He's an award winning public servant.
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,You know who you should talk to?
Leslie Knope,Get used to it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's a man's world, Winston."
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You don't even know the name.
Leslie Knope,"""I, Ron Swanson, recognize that Leslie Knope should have received the IOW Award for all the hard work she has done, especially for the Camp Athena project."""
Leslie Knope,Camp Athena.
Leslie Knope,"""However, in my opinion, she is far too concerned with institutional gratification."""
Leslie Knope,"""So, I am going to let her dangle in order to show her that awards are bull crap."""
Leslie Knope,But you won it.
Leslie Knope,"No, Ron, you deserve it."
Leslie Knope,You deserve it.
Leslie Knope,"So, I would like to present this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Award to Ron Swanson."
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, I'm just very honored to work for someone as insightful and kind as my boss."
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to say.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Get over yourself, Elise."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna push my punches as far as my fists can extend!
Leslie Knope,I won't.
Leslie Knope,I want you to rip awards a new a-hole!
Leslie Knope,And how they are superficial and meaningless.
Leslie Knope,I want you to go to the podium and talk about how stupid awards are.
Leslie Knope,"No, I want you to accept it."
Leslie Knope,Unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,What is happening?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"The IOW is a bunch of sexist jerks who need to get back in the kitchen where they belong, and leave the real feminist work to actual feminists like Ron Swanson!"
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"I know I'm not supposed to care about these things, but this one means a lot."
Leslie Knope,She spent four years in jail for that.
Leslie Knope,She was the first woman in Pawnee to wear pants on a Sunday.
Leslie Knope,But Dorothy Everton Smythe was a trailblazing feminist.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right."
Leslie Knope,You do attend a shocking number of WNBA games.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Athena.
Leslie Knope,"But the fact is, they only give that award to women."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, pretty funny."
Leslie Knope,Haha.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Where are my ladies at?
Leslie Knope,"Can you read it, please?"
Leslie Knope,And my dream.
Leslie Knope,But it's my destiny.
Leslie Knope,Winning is every girl's dream.
Leslie Knope,"And every year, they choose one woman to win the Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award."
Leslie Knope,I have been a dues paying member since I was nine.
Leslie Knope,The IOW is the Indiana Organization of Women.
Leslie Knope,I am Pawnee's Woman of the Year!
Leslie Knope,Do you know what this means?
Leslie Knope,Nobody freak out!
Leslie Knope,It's an envelope from the IOW Awards Office!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,She.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"You're a girl, right?"
Leslie Knope,I was talking to you.
Leslie Knope,'Cause I wasn't talking to you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"And that, little lady, is a Leslie Knope promise!"
Leslie Knope,And then I will make sure that the girls get a place to practice by the end of the week.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, why don't the boys take the field today."
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but it also mentioned my camp project."
Leslie Knope,"No, it doesn't."
Leslie Knope,That-- What?
Leslie Knope,I was as surprised as you were.
Leslie Knope,I think the Pawnee Chapter of the IOW has made a little mistake.
Leslie Knope,What's in the envelope?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I have so much I need to tell you right now.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,That's all I have so far.
Leslie Knope,"""Lock myself in my office and scream until I lose my voice."""
Leslie Knope,"""Write an email to Barack Obama."""
Leslie Knope,"I know, I already started a list."
Leslie Knope,It's mine.
Leslie Knope,Not his.
Leslie Knope,That award is mine.
Leslie Knope,I deserve that award.
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,Why would Ron start a camp for troubled girls?
Leslie Knope,It was my brainchild.
Leslie Knope,I started that.
Leslie Knope,That's my project.
Leslie Knope,"And two, they mentioned the Camp Athena project in that letter."
Leslie Knope,"One, he's not a woman."
Leslie Knope,I just don't get why the IOW would give that award to Ron.
Leslie Knope,They've obviously made some sort of mistake.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,And Ron's the opposite of a woman.
Leslie Knope,They only honor women.
Leslie Knope,I-- That-- No.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with your arm?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, tell me what's wrong with Jerry's arm."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, talk to me."
Leslie Knope,"I would say that some women won't consider moving in with someone unless they think marriage is in the future, which I know, for you is--"
Leslie Knope,"Go, go, go."
Leslie Knope,Go ahead!
Leslie Knope,Run it by me.
Leslie Knope,I genuinely love it.
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,I love having things run by me.
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,In the neck!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, nice shot."
Leslie Knope,He made a bong out of a taxidermied raccoon?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not kidding."
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,"""I recently had the honor of spending an afternoon""with every living former Parks Director, and they taught me a valuable lesson, there is nothing more important than friendship."""
Leslie Knope,"""Make the most of it, while you can."""
Leslie Knope,"""Time is fleeting, my fellow Pawneeans."""
Leslie Knope,"""My fellow Pawneeans, Yes, it's here! The Parks Department's Summer Catalog has arrived and for the first time in 20 years, tennis is back! Peruse this wondrous book at your leisure and take advantage of everything this great town has to offer."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food?
Leslie Knope,But I'll win.
Leslie Knope,"Although, I do expect a fight from Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, my first act as City Manager would be to double the size of the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job and become City Manager.
Leslie Knope,Who knows what the future holds for me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, the thought of that."
Leslie Knope,For realskies?
Leslie Knope,"Maybe I should move, to Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,I'm not really quite sure how I feel.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm happy for them."
Leslie Knope,"Drilling holes, painting, removing wainscoting, she's tearing down the gazebo."
Leslie Knope,What alterations is she trying to make?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody just relax."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, why didn't you try to stop her?"
Leslie Knope,"Unfortunately, they were both horses."
Leslie Knope,"Fortunately, there were two survivors."
Leslie Knope,"But then word got out, and the reception was a bloodbath."
Leslie Knope,The secret ceremony was beautiful and romantic.
Leslie Knope,"In 1867, the progressive Reverend Turnbill officiated a wedding between a white woman and a Wamapoke Indian chief."
Leslie Knope,Turnbill Mansion is one of the most beloved historical sites in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"""Alterations""?"
Leslie Knope,He's tied up right now.
Leslie Knope,I understand that.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director."
Leslie Knope,They're actually a little narrow for me.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no problem."
Leslie Knope,"I have a fresh cup of coffee, comfy furlined boots."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I have everything I need, right?"
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect distraction for me.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't I try to rustle up seven more meetings, 'cause I think it would be cooler if there were an even 100"
Leslie Knope,I have a better idea.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, how fun!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,"If I could just sum it up in one word, it would beâ¦ ohâ¦"
Leslie Knope,It makes me a little nauseous.
Leslie Knope,They're my friends.
Leslie Knope,I-- It's a little weird.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"I'm not gonna stab you in the back or anything, soâ¦ Maybe I should go somewhere."
Leslie Knope,Are we gonna hate each other someday?
Leslie Knope,Everybody take their stuff and go.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for the wonderful memories.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,Everybody looking here.
Leslie Knope,"All right, and not so evil."
Leslie Knope,Just please try to look human.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Line up over there.
Leslie Knope,"Come on! Get out of your seats, turds."
Leslie Knope,Andy! Let's take this picture.
Leslie Knope,"No! You're next, buddy."
Leslie Knope,"Clarence, if you mention anything about women, or menstruation, or anything, I'm gonna take your face and I'm gonna shove it in those brambles."
Leslie Knope,"You're all being awful, horrible men!"
Leslie Knope,Stop it!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, stop it!"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Another?
Leslie Knope,"I would love if anybody just said something positive about, oh, I don't know, anything."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you know what I would love?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Very funny, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, ha, ha."
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank goodness for you."
Leslie Knope,I totally agree.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?
Leslie Knope,I appreciate that.
Leslie Knope,Do you have that picture that Andy took? Maybe I'll run it without any text.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, the point's moot, because you're Park Director now and you're not going anywhere and I'm not making you go anywhere."
Leslie Knope,God! Look at these horrible men.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, April."
Leslie Knope,But every single person who was Parks Director hated their job and hated everyone they worked with.
Leslie Knope,You know what the worst part is is I wanna be Parks Director.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Or something.
Leslie Knope,"""You are the chosen one."""
Leslie Knope,"Leslie, you are the next link in a wonderful chain that stretches back to when our town was founded, and we believe in you and we support you and we'll be following your career."
Leslie Knope,"Ron! That sucked, today."
Leslie Knope,It's so vulgar.
Leslie Knope,I don't like that term.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ron, I really made love to the pooch on this one."
Leslie Knope,"Me, too, Marta."
Leslie Knope,I insist you buy me dinner.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, disgusting fragrance flap."
Leslie Knope,"So goodbye, distilled wisdom of 50 years of experience."
Leslie Knope,"I want you to know that I'm replacing the ""Welcome Letter"" with this ad for Yearning by Dennis Feinstein."
Leslie Knope,But the real one's very bad as well.
Leslie Knope,That-- That's the wrong one.
Leslie Knope,Thanks for the memories.
Leslie Knope,You can also keep the photo.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Oh! Wisdom! Finally.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Because you and your jerk predecessors didn't give me anything to work with.
Leslie Knope,You want me to read you what I have so far in my welcome letter? Nothing.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't even know if I want them in my catalog."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Michael."
Leslie Knope,She's what?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Throw it!
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Tom, throw away the key!"
Leslie Knope,Here they come.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,This is the only rational way I know to prevent this tragedy.
Leslie Knope,"I have no other choice, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Crap on the cob!
Leslie Knope,So?
Leslie Knope,Jessica Wicks is throwing a birthday party for her husband Nick Newport Sr. at the Turnbill Mansion tonight.
Leslie Knope,"""Gazoinksbo."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"She may be a former beauty queen, but today she's the king of destroying history!"""
Leslie Knope,"More like ""Gazoinksbo."""
Leslie Knope,"""Gazebo?"""
Leslie Knope,I need you to get this word for word.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for meeting me here.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, have a good time."
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,You're going on a date with Ann.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you for a second?
Leslie Knope,I'm kind of freaking out about this historical mansion thing.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Leslie Knope,I saw your penis.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, I'm sorry, but you're a little late."
Leslie Knope,"You know, the problem--"
Leslie Knope,"So, you're gonna have to turn this thing around, 'cause you're not getting in here."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the gazebo has been destroyed."
Leslie Knope,"And to some extent, you're right."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're probably thinking, ""There's that crazy gate lady from outside back again."""
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, but I need to say something."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm sorry, everyone."
Leslie Knope,...do one more thing.
Leslie Knope,I just need toâ¦
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,In my brain.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, I know that."
Leslie Knope,I'm about to lose two good friends.
Leslie Knope,"Every time a couple gets married, two single people die."
Leslie Knope,Mark and Ann are gonna get married.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, maybe that's not entirely what I'm upset about."
Leslie Knope,You guys go on ahead.
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom's gonna take me."
Leslie Knope,So what'd you guys talk about at dinner? Huh? Was it fun? Any big decisions arrived at?
Leslie Knope,"And my arm, a little, from the mechanized gate."
Leslie Knope,Nothing's bruised but my ego.
Leslie Knope,I chained myself to a gate.
Leslie Knope,Sorry if I ruined your evening.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna-- You're gonna-- Don't go past the sensor.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, not so close."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann and Mark are coming."
Leslie Knope,"Cut it out, Tom."
Leslie Knope,And the thing that bothers me the most--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God! Tom! Stop him! Jump in front of it! Sacrifice your tiny body! I really thought that gate would open in the middle."
Leslie Knope,"No, she's not."
Leslie Knope,"Not that I saw anything, other than your face, and I would like to talk to you a little bit about this gazebo thing."
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that sounds so romantic."
Leslie Knope,We were both judges at the pageant last year.
Leslie Knope,We've met before.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, yes."
Leslie Knope,"And as a member of the Parks Department, as a Pawneean and an American, I ask you to refrain from harming this historic structure."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, Mr. Newport Sr. I've just been informed that you plan on altering this mansion."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"You know, they may be rich, but they can't just destroy history."
Leslie Knope,What kind of monster would wanna change this?
Leslie Knope,It's gorgeous.
Leslie Knope,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, bye."
Leslie Knope,"But next time more sugar, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I really need it, though."
Leslie Knope,"Well, thanks for the coffee."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,I kind of have an emergency.
Leslie Knope,Sorry I can't hang out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Someone is trying to alter a gazebo.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ron, as much as I would like to go for the ""all-time City Hall single day meetings record,"" there is an emergency."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'll meet you at the car."
Leslie Knope,"God, these are tight!"
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, go get the car."
Leslie Knope,"Um, Jessica, I know you've rented out this house for a party."
Leslie Knope,Nice to see you again.
Leslie Knope,"But it's on the historical register, so we can't allow any changes."
Leslie Knope,That's a saying everywhere.
Leslie Knope,Jessica Wicks refuses to--
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm sorry, but this can't wait."
Leslie Knope,"I have a gazebo update, so ignore all my previous voicemails and emails."
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,I just want to stop a party from happening.
Leslie Knope,I am not a stick-in-the-mud!
Leslie Knope,Your husband's a mushy old pile of rot.
Leslie Knope,Why are you trying to destroy it?
Leslie Knope,It's one of the most beautiful stories in Pawnee's history.
Leslie Knope,"A hundred and fifty years ago, an interracial couple was married here, and then slaughtered by their own families."
Leslie Knope,"Let me tell you a little something about this ""ugly thing,"" ma'am."
Leslie Knope,Ugly thing?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God you haven't torn down the gazebo yet."
Leslie Knope,Green.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so angry, I can't think of another color."
Leslie Knope,"Or else next thing you know, they'll be painting the White House not white."
Leslie Knope,You just can't go around changing everything all of the time.
Leslie Knope,History is important.
Leslie Knope,"Isn't there a way that you could've-- Oh, my!"
Leslie Knope,Why did you have to drill holes in the wall?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,I can't--
Leslie Knope,These were the original hardwood floors.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,You painted this?
Leslie Knope,How much have you done?
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe we can just limit the damage."
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,But the only thing I'm crazy about is leaving the past behind.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit about how the department has changed since you ran it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog."
Leslie Knope,"This is my coworker, Jerry Gergich."
Leslie Knope,"Let's roll, Carl."
Leslie Knope,Sun's going down and it's real dangerous out here.
Leslie Knope,No can do.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"One way or another, I'm going to get money so you can protect Jerry, and all the other helpless, pathetic people in this town."
Leslie Knope,Can't you station a Park Ranger out here?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Just run alongside the cart, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, can you get off, please?"
Leslie Knope,"That's Tom, probably."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm looking forward to working together, Carl."
Leslie Knope,We're ready.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"I know this is painful for you, Jerry, but you have to be strong."
Leslie Knope,Kind of small feet.
Leslie Knope,I just feel like there's more we can do to keep the parks safe.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Carl."
Leslie Knope,They are the first line of defense.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's important to meet with the Park Rangers."
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,Diabetic.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, Muncie is a lovely city."
Leslie Knope,Sloppily out of shape.
Leslie Knope,He was mugged this morning in Ramsett Park.
Leslie Knope,The farting.
Leslie Knope,Were you even in the park yesterday?
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?
Leslie Knope,What about this?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,He can't talk right now because he has hysterical muteness from trauma.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to speak for Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Get up here.
Leslie Knope,"No, I will."
Leslie Knope,You'll be fine.
Leslie Knope,Speak from the heart.
Leslie Knope,Just talk about how hard it was for you.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you nervous?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We treat everyone with respect around here.
Leslie Knope,I don't know who you're referring to.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Paul, but one of my guys got mugged in the park."
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee, I am sorry to say this, but your government is failing you."
Leslie Knope,And it's not coming through.
Leslie Knope,We need money from City Hall.
Leslie Knope,"Head of security, Carl Lorthner, is doing his best to keep the parks safe, but he's failing."
Leslie Knope,Your unpopular coworker?
Leslie Knope,Your simple neighbor?
Leslie Knope,Your frumpy uncle?
Leslie Knope,Who's next?
Leslie Knope,Friend.
Leslie Knope,"Well, why didn't you just tell everybody the truth?"
Leslie Knope,I don't... I don't think your computer is plugged in.
Leslie Knope,That was the last one.
Leslie Knope,And some homemade taffy.
Leslie Knope,Inside are some assignments.
Leslie Knope,I have some folders.
Leslie Knope,Our failure to keep the parks safe.
Leslie Knope,Jerry's face is the symbol of failure.
Leslie Knope,"This is our wakeup call, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, the whole department has a black eye."
Leslie Knope,And we will not let that happen in vain.
Leslie Knope,Our friend got mugged this morning.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's not funny."
Leslie Knope,It's karma.
Leslie Knope,This is on us.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Well, why was he in the park in the first place?"
Leslie Knope,I feel like we're responsible for this.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,You're the victim.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"If even one of them had a unique scar, we got them."
Leslie Knope,Did any of them have weird tattoos or scars or anything?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so sorry, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I was mugged.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, get Jerry to talk to me."
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Um Jerry?
Leslie Knope,"April, I want you to check in with our police liaison."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're with me."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, seriously."
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Nothing but support.
Leslie Knope,No comments.
Leslie Knope,No jokes.
Leslie Knope,"Remember, you guys."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Anything at all.
Leslie Knope,We'll do whatever you want to do.
Leslie Knope,Today is Jerry Day.
Leslie Knope,Listen.
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,It's no trouble for our buddy.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,Look what I did.
Leslie Knope,So did I.
Leslie Knope,Where's the real banner?
Leslie Knope,Really funny.
Leslie Knope,"Haha, guys."
Leslie Knope,Especially Tom.
Leslie Knope,Because we certainly are a bunch of weaklings.
Leslie Knope,We need it.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Everybody dismissed.
Leslie Knope,Just check in with him.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, I need you to go to Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,Did you?
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Jerry! You jumped in a creek for a burrito? What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Kill your wife?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Parks!
Leslie Knope,"When I say ""parks,"" you say ""department!"""
Leslie Knope,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,I think we should just take a moment and appreciate how lucky we are.
Leslie Knope,"Clarence Carrington, David Moser, Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson, gathered together on a beautiful day in this beautiful park."
Leslie Knope,"So, having a picnic with all the former living Parks Department Directors-- Guess who just checked something off her bucket list?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know if that's something I've communicated before.
Leslie Knope,I love parks.
Leslie Knope,"I realize, of course, you're a very busy man."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, not very long."
Leslie Knope,It is such an honor to meet you.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,David Moser!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Hello!
Leslie Knope,Just be like normal people.
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, just act normal."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Somebody's here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It kind of makes you-- What is this?
Leslie Knope,This is probably the first time in history these four great men have been in the same place at the same time.
Leslie Knope,Smoked salmon?
Leslie Knope,Do we have everything?
Leslie Knope,Parks!
Leslie Knope,We need this for the picnic.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Can you guys run up ahead and set up the picnic?
Leslie Knope,It's gonna-- It's gonna be good.
Leslie Knope,But I got them all here and we're gonna have a beautiful picnic.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it hasn't gone exactly as I've hoped."
Leslie Knope,Here we are.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Holy God.
Leslie Knope,It's right up here.
Leslie Knope,We're almost there.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Well, David, I think we've talked enough."
Leslie Knope,There was no other reason you wanted the job?
Leslie Knope,"David, what was it exactly that called you to the Parks Department?"
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I'm Deputy Director now, but I'm hoping someday to be the first female director of the department."
Leslie Knope,"Well, times have changed."
Leslie Knope,I thought there were female teachers way before then.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Clarence, um, why don't you describe the first Summer Pawnee Catalog."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, don't be such a baby."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Why all the sniping?
Leslie Knope,"Look, what was going on back there?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, relax."
Leslie Knope,This is taking a lot longer than I thought it would.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but now, we have the money under false pretenses."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, don't play with the food, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I cannot tell you that.
Leslie Knope,"If I told you, it would ruin the surprise."
Leslie Knope,What's the surprise?
Leslie Knope,It's a surprise!
Leslie Knope,Meet me at Harvey James Park at 11:30.
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise for you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Making fun of Jerry is back!
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but it is so good."
Leslie Knope,Right after I watch it one more time.
Leslie Knope,"This is the only copy, and I am going to destroy it."
Leslie Knope,"And sometimes, the best way to maintain a strong team is just by letting someone know that he is still a part of it."
Leslie Knope,I am part of a great team.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Oh boy, weâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"I have seen Avatar as well, and I think it exceeded the hype."
Leslie Knope,I disagree with Carl.
Leslie Knope,Okay? Just listen to what I have to say.
Leslie Knope,That's not what I am saying.
Leslie Knope,I have a proposition for you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look."
Leslie Knope,"Carl, could you quietly quiet down for a second, and please tell me what is going on, quietly? Okay? In a quiet voice."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Carl.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,Knope.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but you're gonna like this one."
Leslie Knope,I gotta go.
Leslie Knope,I'm not telling you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Get me that.
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know if I have time for this, guys, so, let's just pick a good photo, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"So, basically, boo."
Leslie Knope,"And three, that child looks like it's abandoned."
Leslie Knope,"Two, that was complete gibberish."
Leslie Knope,"One, this is a summer catalog."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this isn't gonna work for a number of reasons."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're up."
Leslie Knope,Cover photo.
Leslie Knope,Enough.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, April."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I don't know if I made it clear, but I don't want any sex offenders in our Parks catalog."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it is."
Leslie Knope,Nice work.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, good job."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need to see your softball pictures."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna move this ""Yearning"" ad to the centerfold."
Leslie Knope,Mainly because we don't get Vogue here.
Leslie Knope,But it's more important to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Think of the September issue of Vogue.
Leslie Knope,It's the biggest catalog of the year.
Leslie Knope,"And the big surprise is I am going to reunite all the living former Parks Directors at a picnic, record the whole thing, and then write about it in the ""Welcome Letter."""
Leslie Knope,We're putting together the Parks Department Summer Catalog.
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you.
Leslie Knope,And I'm not gonna tell anybody!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Close enough.
Leslie Knope,"Rest in peace, friend."
Leslie Knope,Whoohoo!
Leslie Knope,To girlfriends!
Leslie Knope,But please answer them with complete honesty 'cause I'll be able to tell if you're lying.
Leslie Knope,Nothing serious.
Leslie Knope,Just for fun.
Leslie Knope,"Today we will celebrate friendship, spend a few hours together, and answer a couple of questions I've compiled."
Leslie Knope,"Now, this is not technically the right date, but any time a group of women get together for brunch, we embody the spirit of the holiday."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, everyone, for getting together on such short notice, and happy Galentine's day."
Leslie Knope,Honestly we just needed bodies.
Leslie Knope,I don't know her last name.
Leslie Knope,"And then we got Evelyn, aka fake Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Crotchety, but probably wise."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's time for a little Galentine's day Q&A."
Leslie Knope,Bit of a dark horse.
Leslie Knope,"A real fixer-upper, but look, it's not like Ann was doing so hot when I met her."
Leslie Knope,"Pretty, fragile, makes terrible life decisions."
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Vivid imagination, young, and vibrant."
Leslie Knope,April Ludgate.
Leslie Knope,"Confident, worldly, we go way back."
Leslie Knope,Donna Meagle.
Leslie Knope,Prospects for new Pawnee best friend.
Leslie Knope,Good to know.
Leslie Knope,You have a jacuzzi?
Leslie Knope,When did you go to Asia?
Leslie Knope,Oof.
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you pick first."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,The bill is already paid.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this has been fun."
Leslie Knope,Ann had her baby!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,There's that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, we both went to college."
Leslie Knope,"For example, I'm an only child."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we find something, anything, no matter how small, that we have in common?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea."
Leslie Knope,By default?
Leslie Knope,"That's how you want to find your new best friend, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, by default, it's Shauna."
Leslie Knope,Leave the bag.
Leslie Knope,You were in first place.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, why are you angry?"
Leslie Knope,It's simply a way for me to figure out which one of you is the best.
Leslie Knope,It's not what it sounds like.
Leslie Knope,Just jotting down memories in my trusty old journal.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I can work with that."
Leslie Knope,Shauna?
Leslie Knope,"Ethel, have you --Okay, Ethel's asleep."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, anybody reveal anything about their life, anything at all."
Leslie Knope,Wild card option.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Next question.
Leslie Knope,The correct answer for favorite TV show is Friday Night Lights.
Leslie Knope,You're so tan.
Leslie Knope,"Shauna, I'm so glad you could make it."
Leslie Knope,"Side note, do not Google that phrase."
Leslie Knope,It will be a women's only marathon bonding session with tons of whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay, let's do this."
Leslie Knope,"See, that's what I'm talking about."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, every time I start talking to you, five seconds later, I want to jump your bones."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, babe, you can'tâ¦ you would just embarrass yourself."
Leslie Knope,"When she moved, we promised each other that we would talk every day, and we've really fallen behind."
Leslie Knope,Infinity scarves or whether or not it's worth it for me to get Showtime?
Leslie Knope,What do you think should be higher priority?
Leslie Knope,The worst part about your best friend living in another stupid state is the topics really pile up.
Leslie Knope,I am ranking topics of conversation for our next phone call.
Leslie Knope,"The only thing I am crazy about is a magnificent, pregnant manta ray named Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,You're--
Leslie Knope,What if I'm not good at it?
Leslie Knope,What if I take this national parks jobs and I justâ¦ fail?
Leslie Knope,"The kind of work that I've been doing all these years, the nuts and bolts, the grunt work, that's the stuff I know how to do."
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, there's something else I'm worried about."
Leslie Knope,"What? No! Oh, son of a--"
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Leslie Knope,I'm done micromanaging.
Leslie Knope,Let me have this one.
Leslie Knope,I held it together for the entire meeting.
Leslie Knope,She's getting further away.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, she made a possessive."
Leslie Knope,Back off.
Leslie Knope,Are you listening to yourself?
Leslie Knope,Trust Larry?
Leslie Knope,"That should be ""then"", t-h-e-n."
Leslie Knope,On to the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,May I gently suggest that you check out Chris Traeger's wonderful therapist Dr. Richard Nygard.
Leslie Knope,Ben is meeting with the tent people to finalize those deals.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I need an Ann who lives in Pawnee, and there is no one obvious candidate, so I will test them out on the ultimate battlefield of female friendship Galentine's day brunch."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, up front."
Leslie Knope,"Her name is Ann, and she is gone, and I have accepted it, and we are gonna have Galentine's day."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm setting up an impromptu Galentine's day.
Leslie Knope,"Except for now, because now is lady time."
Leslie Knope,You can work whenever.
Leslie Knope,Work?
Leslie Knope,Who you crushing on these days?
Leslie Knope,What's the hot goss?
Leslie Knope,"April, what's the 411, little mama?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't let me interrupt."
Leslie Knope,What's the haps in Meaglewood?
Leslie Knope,What's going down in Donna town?
Leslie Knope,"What's good, baby?"
Leslie Knope,Donna.
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what they'd make you say.
Leslie Knope,I'm coming!
Leslie Knope,"I'm coming, Ann's voice mail!"
Leslie Knope,"God, why'd you let me say all that?"
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"And I made a backup plan for the vendor chart in case, you know, yours isn't good."
Leslie Knope,I brought some fresh snacks.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, ladies, I will be in my office for one to seven hours for my weekly chat with Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Andy, why don't you go with Ron and help him?"
Leslie Knope,Today is that historic day.
Leslie Knope,I always knew there would be a day when I would get through to you and you would love government work.
Leslie Knope,"April and Donna will be helping me with the vendor location charts, and I will be meeting with the surveyors about the concert grounds."
Leslie Knope,Although there is a tiny part of me that always thought it was just Chris talking into a mirror.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, maybe you should look him up."
Leslie Knope,That doesn't apply to therapy.
Leslie Knope,Is there some secret society for the greatest humans on earth?
Leslie Knope,You two know each other?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to work here?
Leslie Knope,I think you'd be great.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, it's a summer internship program."
Leslie Knope,I don't know why I let her name it.
Leslie Knope,"We here at the parks department have something called ""The April Ludgate Summer Solstice Druid Festival and Buffalo Wings Eating Contest."""
Leslie Knope,Because I think you have a real knack for public service.
Leslie Knope,"So I want to show you some very cool before and after pictures of Cherryhurst Park, one of our greatest accomplishments."
Leslie Knope,"And, Allison, come by my office later so we can keep crushing it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody get back to work."
Leslie Knope,I thought they went out of business.
Leslie Knope,Juan Julio Oficina Supplies?
Leslie Knope,I thought those were discontinued.
Leslie Knope,Are those jense-trodder color tabs?
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,So what do you got?
Leslie Knope,"All right, Allison, you are in charge of choosing the prom theme, and now it has to be perfect and magical and look like a million bucks but cost zero bucks."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, you can co-DJ with Tom."
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that little puppies could operate an iPod with their little puppy paws.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, did you want to DJ, little puppy?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge of music."
Leslie Knope,"Now, our budget is basically zero, so we're gonna need to cover all the jobs that we would normally hire people for."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are making progress, prom committee."
Leslie Knope,Prom!
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Do you meet Tom Hanks and Elena Kagan in the Statue of Liberty's crown?
Leslie Knope,"The point is, will you go to the prom with me?"
Leslie Knope,"God, this fake club I'm inventing is amazing."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you shut your mustache?
Leslie Knope,"You want to hold it not too tight, sort of like a firm handshake and then move towards the ground in a rope pulling motion."
Leslie Knope,There's a little trick to it.
Leslie Knope,So have you ever pulled a ceremonial cord before?
Leslie Knope,Mark my words.
Leslie Knope,"I know what you're doing, Ron, and I will defeat you."
Leslie Knope,See you soon!
Leslie Knope,I'll just be over here having fun.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hooray!"
Leslie Knope,Will you help me orchestrate the balloon drop?
Leslie Knope,Listen to me closely.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, Allison, I have a question for you that's very important and very serious."
Leslie Knope,No bigs.
Leslie Knope,I didn't even notice.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, did he?"
Leslie Knope,Can I get that in writing?
Leslie Knope,Aplus!
Leslie Knope,"And if Ron tries to stop me, he can eat a big ol' bowl of butts."
Leslie Knope,It's really quite beautiful.
Leslie Knope,The seasons turn.
Leslie Knope,Circle of life.
Leslie Knope,"Interns become fulltime staff, become department directors."
Leslie Knope,I need to plant seeds for the next generation.
Leslie Knope,I may be leaving this office soon.
Leslie Knope,"Is it worth a few bucks to get a million splinters in your fingers and then cut off your fingers accidentally, 'cause that will happen."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,That's what he calls city hall.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you-- Hm--there's--that's--that's spelled wrong."
Leslie Knope,Legend has it that he can still turn on a microwave just by blinking at it.
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't be.
Leslie Knope,I think Oliver has more pressing business.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"It's just I'm missing you, and there's so much stuff I want to talk to you about."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I know, you're right, Ann."
Leslie Knope,That family is garbage.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, he didn't watch out for his brother."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause Riggins is a criminal."
Leslie Knope,You have all the strengths.
Leslie Knope,You shut your mouth.
Leslie Knope,Nobody can match your ethnic hybrid energy.
Leslie Knope,"I need to find a replacement, and don't worry, it didn't work."
Leslie Knope,"What do you want me to do, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought maybe I could use Galentine's day as an opportunity--"
Leslie Knope,"I even tried to rank the women at work, but that was a total bust."
Leslie Knope,No one even comes close to you as a friend.
Leslie Knope,I miss you so much.
Leslie Knope,"Mm, I don't want to drive back."
Leslie Knope,Where's Chris?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm glad I'm here now."
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell me you were in labor?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're always beautiful, but right now you are the most beautiful, glowing sun goddess ever."
Leslie Knope,And you're so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, he's so beautiful."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Good luck!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"What? Ann, you're somebody's mother."
Leslie Knope,"A few weeks later, he almost died from a VCR electrocution."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'll call you from the car.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I made out with Harvey from the A.V. Club."
Leslie Knope,"In my senior year when I couldn't decide between Indiana and Amherst, I focused all my energy on planning my prom, and it was the best prom ever."
Leslie Knope,"I can't stop thinking about that job in Chicago, and I think this prom will be a good distraction."
Leslie Knope,"Which reminds me, I need to learn Latin."
Leslie Knope,"They also wanted to cut A.P. Latin, so I volunteered to teach Latin."
Leslie Knope,"So as a last minute hail Mary, the parks department is throwing prom for them."
Leslie Knope,"Because of the merger, schools have had to make some cuts, and the first thing to go was the senior prom."
Leslie Knope,Open the bottom drawer and read the cake.
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to surprise you.
Leslie Knope,"Baby, relax."
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Leslie Knope,"Sweetheart, stop."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, we'll forge our own unique traditions in the fiery cauldron of female friendship."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's fine."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You know, when Ann and I used to fight, we would make up with a five-minute hug."
Leslie Knope,I'm very lucky to have you both.
Leslie Knope,I'll take it.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"You're wonderful friends, and I love you."
Leslie Knope,"I was all screwed up, and I'm really sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I totally blew it."
Leslie Knope,And a mocha ice blended for Donna.
Leslie Knope,For April.
Leslie Knope,Gross.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, black coffee with extra grounds."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna give you two some time.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna hand things over to Larry Gengurch, who is 100% in charge."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to a public forum to choose our new town slogan."
Leslie Knope,But you're a little late.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you have no idea how meaningful it is to hear you say that."
Leslie Knope,Liam B-- You don't have to tell me!
Leslie Knope,You read my proposal to clean up the Pawnee river? I wrote this two years ago.
Leslie Knope,Really? You know who I am?
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this week just keeps getting better and better."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,I would like to apply to turn some of our new land into a national park.
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,It's been kind of a hectic week.
Leslie Knope,I had to reschedule.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Wonderful!
Leslie Knope,I am!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes!"
Leslie Knope,Now I shall meet with a very important person whilst sporting a gruesome shiner.
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,I wonder what other excellent surprise lies in store for Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Everything I try with this merger backfires.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, everything sucks."
Leslie Knope,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,"It's just like a big, fun... stinking turd nugget."
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a challenge."
Leslie Knope,It's fine.
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, April."
Leslie Knope,How is any of that good news?
Leslie Knope,The river cleanup's well underway.
Leslie Knope,It's working.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,I come here to think sometimes.
Leslie Knope,That's not your hand.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,When do you need your answer?
Leslie Knope,And I won't know until I finish what I've started.
Leslie Knope,"It's an amazing offer and I'm very interested, but if I'm going to leave Pawnee I need to know it's gonna be okay without me."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I meant because I can think of a lot of reasons not to take it."
Leslie Knope,And I have to say I can't think of one single reason not to take it.
Leslie Knope,I've been thinking about your offer.
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,He is a beautiful boy.
Leslie Knope,It's a story about a radiator.
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,What the hell? I need your help.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, man, you are lucky."
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with me?
Leslie Knope,"And yet every time I contemplate leaving, just walking away once and for all, I just can't do it."
Leslie Knope,They literally punch me in the face.
Leslie Knope,"They call me names, they recall me, they try to kill the merger."
Leslie Knope,But the more I try to fix it the more people fight me.
Leslie Knope,"Look, you know how much I love Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"I am going to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that I have, and you cannot ask me any questions or details about it."
Leslie Knope,But now that you're hereâ¦
Leslie Knope,By myself.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,Here it is.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,What up?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's all the time I have."
Leslie Knope,Everybodyâ¦ should check their walls for bees.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, in fact you should treat this like a public service announcement."
Leslie Knope,I did not know that bees were in that wall.
Leslie Knope,And for the last time this was not a prank.
Leslie Knope,"They were not my bees, Trodd."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, one Pawneean was stung in his mouth because he was laughing at the Eagletonians."
Leslie Knope,The Eagletonians were simply closest to the wall.
Leslie Knope,I didn't pull anything off.
Leslie Knope,Nobody panic!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Bees!
Leslie Knope,Bees!
Leslie Knope,This is such a great day for--
Leslie Knope,"Take it away, guys."
Leslie Knope,"In the name of unity, I have given some former Eagletonians the first strike."
Leslie Knope,Now it is time to tear down this wall.
Leslie Knope,"A few years ago, Eagleton put up this wall along the border."
Leslie Knope,"This three day music and arts festival will end on a day we will call ""New Founder's Day,"" an official beginning to our new town."
Leslie Knope,This spring we will be holding a massive unity concert to commemorate the merger between Pawnee and Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,Just take some beef jerky and hush!
Leslie Knope,And a special thank you to the city council for their support.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, everyone, for coming."
Leslie Knope,We should just knock it down.
Leslie Knope,"We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them."
Leslie Knope,"You know, why do we even have this wall?"
Leslie Knope,I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.
Leslie Knope,I cannot meet with him right now.
Leslie Knope,It's to distract people from my black eye.
Leslie Knope,"We are in crisis mode, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, girl."
Leslie Knope,Motherâ¦ puncher!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,There shouldn't be fighting in a hospital!
Leslie Knope,No fighting in a hospital.
Leslie Knope,It was my idea.
Leslie Knope,Mine.
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter who bailed out who, or who seceded from you."
Leslie Knope,Pawneeans and Eagletonians need to find a way to come together and bury the hatchet.
Leslie Knope,I just came here by myself to apologize to all the Eagletonians who got stung.
Leslie Knope,This is not a publicity stunt.
Leslie Knope,These are your cameras.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,These gift baskets are for innocent victims not for jerks who got stung because they were laughing at other people's pain.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,I hope you look a lot less gross very soon.
Leslie Knope,I'm so incredibly sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I won't bring any."
Leslie Knope,"April, your competence and your levelheadedness is very moving to me, and I will follow your advice right after I go to the hospital and apologize to every victim in person."
Leslie Knope,Why would anybody think that was a prank?
Leslie Knope,"This merger is so fragile, everyone is on edge, and no one is talking about the unity concert."
Leslie Knope,Don't mention my bee hole.
Leslie Knope,"Larry, don't tell him that."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"No, wait!"
Leslie Knope,"Larry, just tell him I need to reschedule because I am trying to fix my bee hole disaster."
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, my depth perception is totally screwed up."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, Ben worked really hard on this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You--
Leslie Knope,"You know, just do your thing, chicken wing."
Leslie Knope,"I don't give a fart, bros."
Leslie Knope,Butâ¦ I don't care.
Leslie Knope,"Like, you know, ""Storied past, bright future""?"
Leslie Knope,It's vote for another slogan.
Leslie Knope,Or you know what would also be kind of dope for the people of Douche nation to do?
Leslie Knope,I never knew that objectifying women could be so much fun.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it is been so fun broing out with my dogs."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I don't know how you got yours hand on that.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Ahâ¦ I'm gonna say butt.
Leslie Knope,Hard to believe this is a fan game for your radio listeners.
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,A minus.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,From charity?
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would rate her acting as an ""A."""
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,I'm justâ¦ chillin' in the studes with my dudes.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just psyched to be in the studio, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm not here to nag, guys."
Leslie Knope,No way!
Leslie Knope,Classic!
Leslie Knope,"I need these guys to think that I'm, like, super chill."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, I almost pulled that off."
Leslie Knope,"So, how do I look?"
Leslie Knope,"Or, maybe we sneak back in there you distract those guys for, like, 30, 90 minutes, I get on live radio, I give an impassioned speech about what slogan I want to endorse and I play a few songs, which I always wanted to do, and then we just see what happens."
Leslie Knope,I should just let this go.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Larry, can you get in here?"
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I would not have started the sentence if I knew Larry was the only one here."
Leslie Knope,The public forum will be run byâ¦
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,I guess I should practice delegating.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have I really pulled my last bloated raccoon carcass from a public fountain?"
Leslie Knope,"I would miss that, very much."
Leslie Knope,"I spoke to grant about the national parks job, and he mentioned that's mostly big picture planning and delegating, and not very much nitty-gritty, hands on stuff that I love to do."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Parking tickets, code violations... send them all to me."
Leslie Knope,"Well, no worries, I will handle all of the overflow work personally."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,You wanted to see me?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"I'm wondering, is there a way I can communicate with everybody who voted?"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"These jerks are trying to hijack my online poll, and so far the leading town slogan is, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt."""
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom told you are sort of like a computer expert."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"You can pay parking tickets, you can apply for a business license and the best part is we're going to put up an online poll so people can pick the new town slogan!"
Leslie Knope,I enjoy the challenge.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"Now that Eagleton and Pawnee have merged, it is time to pick a new town slogan."
Leslie Knope,The waffles were great.
Leslie Knope,"Grant is great, the job is great."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, totally."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I hardly ever do it in my bed on a Saturday night while listening to old spice girls CDs.
Leslie Knope,I hate paperwork.
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,"Because it is always been a dream of mine to plant spotted jewelweed along the red river bank in Arkansas, but I'm sure you hear that a lot."
Leslie Knope,"Now, were would I be actually doing the physical planting?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth from last question is about the Heartland Exotic Plant Management Project."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, one minute you're just a regular girl in the crowd, and the next minute you're dancing 10 feet away from freakin' Max Weinberg!"
Leslie Knope,This is like the parks equivalent of Bruce Springsteen pulling Courtney Cox onstage.
Leslie Knope,Grant Larson has offered me a chance to oversee a branch office of the national park service.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna need two hours worth of waffles.
Leslie Knope,Martha?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Now, the reason why I asked you to meet me here"
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to check this out.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for meeting me here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. Larson."
Leslie Knope,I want to play!
Leslie Knope,The panda holds a paddle with his tail.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a cool way to choose our new town's slogan.
Leslie Knope,Let's look at the online polls.
Leslie Knope,And a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town's identity.
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to do this."
Leslie Knope,"There is New York, the city that never sleeps."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so people can vote now."
Leslie Knope,"I would be a very strong dictator, and you would be my bodyguard, and you would lead my army."
Leslie Knope,"If I we're a dictator, I would throw the Douche in prison without a trial."
Leslie Knope,I'm not a dictator.
Leslie Knope,That's how democracy works.
Leslie Knope,Because every election has a write-in option.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"""Storied past, bright future""?"
Leslie Knope,What's leading?
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, yes, I do."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira."
Leslie Knope,"I think it means ""John."""
Leslie Knope,"Isn't ""Juan"" a man's name?"
Leslie Knope,"Joan, this poll is a chance to give our newly merged city a new identity to really rebrand this town."
Leslie Knope,"All of the choices for the town slogan are wonderful, but if I had to choose my favorite it would probably be ""Storied past, bright future."""
Leslie Knope,"So true, Perd."
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here."
Leslie Knope,Mr. Strange Cameraman Who I Never Met.
Leslie Knope,"This press junket is a brilliant idea, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them."
Leslie Knope,"We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll."
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?
Leslie Knope,"We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass."
Leslie Knope,"There's a lot of nitty-gritty left to do, Ben."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're not gonna do that."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"And then there is Glenwater, Florida, home of America's most violent Walmart parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you don't have to thank me."
Leslie Knope,Working for the government is its own reward--
Leslie Knope,"Run, Allison, run."
Leslie Knope,We have so much to learn from each other.
Leslie Knope,Off to kind of a weird start.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"But one that had food and drink and dancing, that sort of thing."
Leslie Knope,"When I said party, I meant one that did not include sex for pay."
Leslie Knope,I think there might've been a translation problem.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, my job is to see to your every need."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know you gentlemen had a long flight, but I have prepared a welcome party in your honor."
Leslie Knope,"Go, boy!"
Leslie Knope,We will get our pathetic servant boy to fetch your luggage.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Do this for me?
Leslie Knope,Just be a good host.
Leslie Knope,"It's a different culture, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, please."
Leslie Knope,And he is?
Leslie Knope,"I am Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and Chairwoman of the Departmental Ad Hoc Subcommittee for Pit Beautification, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, most excellent representatives of the great Parks Department of Boraqua, Venezuela."
Leslie Knope,That was one of the most difficult phone calls I've ever had to make.
Leslie Knope,I had to drop the Rock and Roll bowling alley from our itinerary.
Leslie Knope,How do you fit all of Pawnee in a 48 hour visit?
Leslie Knope,"It's not been easy, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I've put this whole trip together, and let me tell you something."
Leslie Knope,This is my baby.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, hit it."
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, just be Good."
Leslie Knope,What kind of birds do you guys eat?
Leslie Knope,Pull your thing up.
Leslie Knope,"Us, too!"
Leslie Knope,"Water, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,This is our thermometer!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,A restaurant?
Leslie Knope,I have a full day of activities planned.
Leslie Knope,"Let's get started, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"She's the strongest, smartest punching bag in the world."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause, nobody takes a punch like her."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, that's why people respect Hillary Clinton so much."
Leslie Knope,I'm not supposed to take it personally.
Leslie Knope,I'm a diplomat.
Leslie Knope,"That's fine, it's my job."
Leslie Knope,"His English isn't perfect, so I don't think he realizes how insulting he's being."
Leslie Knope,"Kernston's Rubber Nipples, tastes like the real thing."
Leslie Knope,"And eight and a half dozen rubber baby bottle nipples, also made here in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Since 1891.
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, Sweetums!"
Leslie Knope,Sweetums!
Leslie Knope,"A bottle of high fructose corn syrup, made right here in Pawnee's own Sweetums factory."
Leslie Knope,And I found the perfect thing.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it needs to represent the local culture."
Leslie Knope,"The gift has to be nice enough to honor and respect the guest, but not so nice that it shames him."
Leslie Knope,A key aspect to diplomacy is gift giving.
Leslie Knope,This gun truly symbolizes the blossoming peace between our two nations.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, go get water."
Leslie Knope,I can assure you that that water's very safe to drink.
Leslie Knope,Agua.
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit into a community park.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, clean up."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"The man of my dreams, the one that I love, shh."
Leslie Knope,Benjamin Wyatt
Leslie Knope,Breathe.
Leslie Knope,"Honey, can you just breathe for a second?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, honey--"
Leslie Knope,It's now called the Virginia Woolf prize-- different time.
Leslie Knope,Half of my tuition was paid for by the Indiana scholarship for pretty blondes who like to read.
Leslie Knope,They'll get scholarships.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, our kids will be geniuses."
Leslie Knope,It'll be fine.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're not, we have three weeks until the concert."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, hey, you're looking at a woman who just hit triple cherries in her uterus."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we'll win the lottery.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there's still plenty of ways to raise money for the concert, right?"
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I wonder if I'll ever stop doing that.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"He can go, right, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, he's feeling better."
Leslie Knope,We have a concert to save.
Leslie Knope,"No, we do not have time."
Leslie Knope,"You know the EMT said that if flea had sent you his bass, you could've lost a thumb."
Leslie Knope,Poor Ben.
Leslie Knope,Ben!
Leslie Knope,Don't make me pull the permits on your rental units.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Pearl, jump in."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,Here they are.
Leslie Knope,"You just look so crazy right now, but cute."
Leslie Knope,"Everything that we have been through-- the harvest festival, the election, the recall, the merger, Ann leaving, Larry changing his name for some stupid reason-- all of it has just been preparation for this."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,"April, you know Spanish, right?"
Leslie Knope,What if they don't speak English?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,"Our guests are gonna stay in a motel, for sure."
Leslie Knope,But things have changed.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has kind of a tricky history with welcoming foreign visitors.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am a little nervous."
Leslie Knope,Our only job over the next two days is to make these men feel at home.
Leslie Knope,These men are not used to the wealth and flash that we have here in central Indiana.
Leslie Knope,"Also, remember, everyone, Venezuela is a poor country."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna need your suggestions about my wardrobe ASAP."
Leslie Knope,Our photo-op with the mayor is tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
Leslie Knope,"Today we are welcoming a delegation from the Parks Department of our sister city, Boraqua, Venezuela."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's nice of him.
Leslie Knope,We're having triplets.
Leslie Knope,"We're having triplets, andâ¦"
Leslie Knope,The truth is I'm pregnant.
Leslie Knope,It was a pointless ruse designed to waste time.
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter, Larry."
Leslie Knope,The reason I have been acting so weird is not because I've been waiting for the results of the soil samples to come back.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, if you could gather aroundâ¦"
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I am immune to stress because I have you.
Leslie Knope,Because I realized something.
Leslie Knope,That is outrageous.
Leslie Knope,"But I need 35,000 dollars, and the city doesn't have enough money in its budget."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Raul, gentlemen, thank you for coming."
Leslie Knope,I'll take those.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,I'll have some nuts.
Leslie Knope,I'd love some coffee.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, yesterday I was Hillary Clinton, and today I'm Bill."
Leslie Knope,Yesterday I was tough and direct and today I have to be charming.
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to!
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"No, they were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks!"
Leslie Knope,Don't do that!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Now, I may have lost my cool, but they deserved it."
Leslie Knope,"Look, those guys were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks."
Leslie Knope,They started it.
Leslie Knope,"Great, then don't take them."
Leslie Knope,Those are our pens.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Look, if you don't like it here, then go, okay, Raul?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't, Raul."
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,I don't like Chavez.
Leslie Knope,"Good, I just did."
Leslie Knope,Stupid Chavez.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would just like to first say, I am so sorry for blowing up yesterday."
Leslie Knope,"And I think that your medals are stupid and your uniform is lame, and you guys want to marry Hugo Chavez!"
Leslie Knope,It was completely uncalled for.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, we can't take this."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Viva Chavez.
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to ""viva"" that guy."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Venezuela!"
Leslie Knope,Viva Venezuela!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's really generous."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is a check for 35,000 dollars and it is to build a park."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yes, I do."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sure."
Leslie Knope,The mayor will be with us in just a few minutes.
Leslie Knope,Raul.
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, I still feel kind of weird about this money."
Leslie Knope,"Meeting adjourned, Jerry!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay? Everybody happy? Jerry, are you happy?"
Leslie Knope,We'll keep the money.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Pro and con never works!
Leslie Knope,"Con, Ann already said that."
Leslie Knope,"Con, not quite sure why that's a pro."
Leslie Knope,"Con, we might be filling it in with dirty money."
Leslie Knope,Let's look at the pros and cons.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna return the money.
Leslie Knope,"It's from a foreign government, I don't really trust these guys."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should return the money.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"35,000 dollars?"
Leslie Knope,You've never had a budget shortage?
Leslie Knope,And I think you've been rude since you came here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, you can't, 'cause you've never been there."
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Correct what?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?
Leslie Knope,"Take it in, boys."
Leslie Knope,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,I'm coming over to your house then.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Do you have TBS in Venezuela?
Leslie Knope,You can watch TBS.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the motel we're putting you up in is really nice."
Leslie Knope,Comfortable?
Leslie Knope,Everybody doing okay back there?
Leslie Knope,We'll go to the park.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, never mind."
Leslie Knope,They'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,"No, wait, the money's different there."
Leslie Knope,Or London!
Leslie Knope,Or New York.
Leslie Knope,We'll take them to Chicago and pretend it's part of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, we'll go further."
Leslie Knope,"What we're gonna do is, we're gonna take them to our best park and we're gonna blow their socks off."
Leslie Knope,We can't be humble anymore.
Leslie Knope,I'm calling an audible.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, I know these guys didn't turn out to be exactly how we thought they would be."
Leslie Knope,The Venezuelans are a very confident people.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I do not understand."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, well."
Leslie Knope,This is already a park.
Leslie Knope,I think you're rude.
Leslie Knope,And it's one of our best loved parks.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, size doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,Or the moon!
Leslie Knope,Or American Idol.
Leslie Knope,Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Leslie Knope,Nothing gets done?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"In a true Democracy, we believe that the input of our citizens is extremely valuable."
Leslie Knope,That's one perspective.
Leslie Knope,What did you think of the open forum?
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was tough going, but it was lively."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,The ideas are what shine in our meetings.
Leslie Knope,We don't need palaces.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Where do you hold your meetings?
Leslie Knope,Sometimes we have them on the volleyball courts.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the location rotates."
Leslie Knope,We're about to start.
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready?"
Leslie Knope,Let's go to a town hall meeting.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna show you an example of that.
Leslie Knope,Democracy.
Leslie Knope,But we have something more beautiful than Lady Gaga.
Leslie Knope,And I don't think she's going to come here unless her career takes a very bad turn.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't have Lady Gaga."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,They're not that small.
Leslie Knope,These people are the worst!
Leslie Knope,With the crazy hat and a monkey on his shoulder.
Leslie Knope,An elegant
Leslie Knope,"Back in your tent, sicky."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,He titled their last album We'll Never Reunite.
Leslie Knope,Their lead singer split 10 years ago.
Leslie Knope,But there's no way they're getting back together.
Leslie Knope,Everybody does.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love them."
Leslie Knope,Land Ho.
Leslie Knope,"""Bob Dylan's friends?"""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, those are long shots."
Leslie Knope,Play it again.
Leslie Knope,"His latest song, Beautiful Like My Mom parentheses Support the Troops has, like, two million hits on YouTube."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He's like Indiana's sweetheart.
Leslie Knope,Chipp McCapp is the most amazing 17 year old country singer in the entire world.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no, I don't want to touch your hand."
Leslie Knope,Nice!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,We already forwarded your mail.
Leslie Knope,"The tent is your home now, Larry."
Leslie Knope,We already had to quarantine Larry.
Leslie Knope,People are dropping like flies.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch anything.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch your face.
Leslie Knope,Stock up on Kleenex.
Leslie Knope,"It's flu season again, and I cannot get sick."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Are you getting sick?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need all hands on deck."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, you and I need to handle this."
Leslie Knope,"We're sorry to interrupt, Chipp."
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,Are you having a stroke?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I have very big news for you.
Leslie Knope,It's wife.
Leslie Knope,It's your me.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to call Ben about nothing.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I just need a minute."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't think it could be anythingâ¦"
Leslie Knope,It's the flu.
Leslie Knope,The Mariah needs to sing tonight stuff.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I have a ton of work to do, so I need the good stuff."
Leslie Knope,It's a total disaster.
Leslie Knope,"Supernauseated for a few days, a lot of barfing."
Leslie Knope,I have the flu.
Leslie Knope,You can buy two candies.
Leslie Knope,That's not first aid.
Leslie Knope,"I've had the flu before, and I worked through it."
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,"All we need to do is go to Indianapolis, convince Chipp to do the festival and then, you know, head home."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Larry!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,We need to be operating at maximum
Leslie Knope,There are no hands to be on deck because everybody's at the winery.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Can we get a little music here maybe?
Leslie Knope,"Without further ado, help me congratulate Allison Gliffert!"
Leslie Knope,Now it is time for the most magical moment of any high school prom: The announcement of the winner of the Parks and Recreation's coveted summer internship.
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,"I think the only thing that matters is whatever Apluses may or may not have been handed out, you know, are still in effect in perpetuity."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that I'm equipped to handle it.
Leslie Knope,I've never had a principal or a teacher be disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,Don't be disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"I wouldn't say ""harassing"" so much as persistently tormenting."
Leslie Knope,There's no turning back!
Leslie Knope,She pulled the rope.
Leslie Knope,She's gonna take that internship.
Leslie Knope,"And second of all, I already beat it."
Leslie Knope,"First of all, your telephone is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,Everybody's having a terrible time.
Leslie Knope,You've ruined prom.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces!
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces.
Leslie Knope,Pull the rope.
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces.
Leslie Knope,That's what government is about.
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces of the people as the balloons drop.
Leslie Knope,"Now, when you pull the rope, don't look at the balloons."
Leslie Knope,Don't listen to him.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna fall in love with public service.
Leslie Knope,Pikitis!
Leslie Knope,She's a terrible person with terrible judgment.
Leslie Knope,Offer is off the table.
Leslie Knope,You might say that.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Gregory."
Leslie Knope,Greg Pikitis.
Leslie Knope,"Get her away from me, or I'm gonna kidnap her and try to mentor her to death."
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, Ron, she is so thoughtful and grounded."
Leslie Knope,"And whatever you choose, you'll be great at it."
Leslie Knope,You're a good kid.
Leslie Knope,"You just have so much promise, we got excited."
Leslie Knope,"Allison, we wanted to apologize for acting so bananas."
Leslie Knope,I just wish once you would say something stupid so I could ignore it.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, but you're hopeless without me."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, let's face it, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"You know? Allison would become April, and then April would become me."
Leslie Knope,I just need to make sure that the future is secure around here when I leave.
Leslie Knope,"I'm thinking of leaving Pawnee, moving to Chicago."
Leslie Knope,Nobody told them to do that.
Leslie Knope,They wrote all the team names in pink.
Leslie Knope,Saves a lot of time.
Leslie Knope,Smart.
Leslie Knope,"And if this is the evening you decide to have sex, use protection, please!"
Leslie Knope,"You'll win a seat in congress, and then you and I will run against each other as president, but right before we find out who won, I'm gonna pat you on the back and say, ""It's your turn, kid."""
Leslie Knope,You'll take over Ron's job as parks director.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna rise through the ranks.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take this internship.
Leslie Knope,"3,000, says the gentleman"
Leslie Knope,We just wanted to say we are such big fans.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Are you ready to go, my gentle dove?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"I always knew we were one in a million, and now we got the proof!"
Leslie Knope,This is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"If we do this right, we can be parents to 1/3 of the supreme court!"
Leslie Knope,We knocked it out of the park on the first try.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it.
Leslie Knope,Triplets.
Leslie Knope,Triplets?
Leslie Knope,Triplets?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're having twins."
Leslie Knope,Twins.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,I win.
Leslie Knope,"Now, Ben wants me to slow down, but I have this huge project coming up, and slowing down isn't really my jam."
Leslie Knope,He's a little weird.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I feel fine, and if you're worried, we can just ask Dr. Saperstein what he thinks."
Leslie Knope,The concert is in three weeks.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, I cannot slow down."
Leslie Knope,Cover me.
Leslie Knope,Think they're valuable?
Leslie Knope,What about those fish?
Leslie Knope,What else can we auction off?
Leslie Knope,"We need to raise a minimum of $30,000 from the auction, or else the concert's gonna be in trouble."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So just hang in there, please."
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming to this wonderful and calm event.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are going to have a doctor's appointment, and then after that, we can probably tell people."
Leslie Knope,Our first item up for bid is two allaccess V.I.P. passes to the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Do I hear 40?
Leslie Knope,It looks like we've got a real bidding war between
Leslie Knope,Well..
Leslie Knope,The sheik has thrown his hat into the ring.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, yeah, here we go."
Leslie Knope,"So do I hear 2,000?"
Leslie Knope,She's real.
Leslie Knope,"She doesn't like attention, but she's there."
Leslie Knope,Don't look at her.
Leslie Knope,A very wealthy and elegant looking woman with a diamond encrusted eye patch just raised her hand.
Leslie Knope,"Anyone want to-- Oh, thank you, madam."
Leslie Knope,"Our next item up for bid is the naming rights for our children's tent, so let's start the bidding at 1,000 dollars, please."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm doing really fine."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,How magnificent.
Leslie Knope,Sold for 50 dollars.
Leslie Knope,We're all just calm and happy people enjoying ourselves together on earth.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's fine."
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Any higher?
Leslie Knope,Terrific.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, sir."
Leslie Knope,50 dollars.
Leslie Knope,Anyone for 50?
Leslie Knope,50
Leslie Knope,We can beat this.
Leslie Knope,40
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Let's start the bidding at 40 dollars.
Leslie Knope,It's an honor to meet you.
Leslie Knope,We'll be back.
Leslie Knope,"All right, yep."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Personal things that I can't talk to you about.
Leslie Knope,There's just a lot of things going on right now.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm so frazzled.
Leslie Knope,"I lost our headliner, I can't stop throwing up, and Ben has not called me back yet."
Leslie Knope,It was not awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Stupid.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,We're not.
Leslie Knope,That makes us sound like hicks.
Leslie Knope,"And you should know that, when you shook my hand earlier, there was pee on my palms."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee does not need you.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,This is over.
Leslie Knope,You're crazy.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it is an amazing place to raise kids and start a family."
Leslie Knope,With good people from all walks of life.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is a good town.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,It's the entire region.
Leslie Knope,It's not just Pawnee that needs you.
Leslie Knope,We know that you have that important other engagement--
Leslie Knope,But we need him.
Leslie Knope,He's a monster.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, keep working."
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what I needed to hear right now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we need lights, generators, microphones, water, that boring stuff too."
Leslie Knope,"We're throwing a charity auction to raise money for the unity concert, and we're gonna need it too, if I'm gonna perform Islands In the Stream with a Sacagawea hologram."
Leslie Knope,"It's a long story, but the short version is, I'm currently catfishing Anthony Kiedis."
Leslie Knope,How'd you do that?
Leslie Knope,"That's great, April."
Leslie Knope,"Well, buddy, I've got some good news for you."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, what happened to you?"
Leslie Knope,We got Land Ho to play the Unity Concert.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I have so much to tell you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,My stomach is trying to murder me.
Leslie Knope,"Um, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I understand."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,And you stand by.
Leslie Knope,I will give him a brief explanation about the Unity Concert.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, that is not a good strategy, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait."
Leslie Knope,How are we going to convince this guy to reunite Land Ho?
Leslie Knope,It's time for a Hail Mary.
Leslie Knope,We are out of options.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I think we need to focus on the fact that we have lost our headliner."
Leslie Knope,Why did you go like this?
Leslie Knope,What did you think?
Leslie Knope,"God, it's so weird that you know that I'm pregnant before Ben does."
Leslie Knope,What is he saying?
Leslie Knope,I painted over that graffiti a week ago.
Leslie Knope,Today might be the day that I finally crowd surf.
Leslie Knope,Catch.
Leslie Knope,I'm lucky to have a friend who would spend a whole day being so mean to me.
Leslie Knope,Ann is so awesome.
Leslie Knope,You coy bastard.
Leslie Knope,"Well, well, well."
Leslie Knope,It's just a date.
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be fun.
Leslie Knope,We're just two people trying to go on a date.
Leslie Knope,I don't understand why you're being so terrible.
Leslie Knope,'Cause you're disgusting.
Leslie Knope,"No, Dave."
Leslie Knope,"And when she died, it was one of--"
Leslie Knope,"I don't need your dress anymore, I'm gonna wear my own stuff."
Leslie Knope,"That dog was, like, my best friend."
Leslie Knope,It's called a bathroom!
Leslie Knope,It's a bathroom!
Leslie Knope,"You know, Dave, the place where you... You know, the toilet thing."
Leslie Knope,Just I have to go to the whiz palace.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,I got flowers in your soup.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,You want some?
Leslie Knope,There's bread.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look."
Leslie Knope,My niece's name is Stephanie.
Leslie Knope,I don't have a niece.
Leslie Knope,"Why would you say that, Dave?"
Leslie Knope,Me power.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dave."
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Ann was helping me because I was panicking about tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,You make a better door than a guy.
Leslie Knope,"So, move, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I'm coming inside.
Leslie Knope,I do know.
Leslie Knope,"Cause I walked here, 'cause... The drinking."
Leslie Knope,Can I come and sit down for a little bit?
Leslie Knope,I'm not scared.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's do this bitch!"
Leslie Knope,Up top.
Leslie Knope,"And I think our first date tomorrow is gonna go awesome, off the charts amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know today is today, and it's not tomorrow, but I felt like you should know that I'm awesome, and you're lucky to have me."
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,"Help, police!"
Leslie Knope,You're awesome.
Leslie Knope,"You are, too, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"You are, too."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and you are, too."
Leslie Knope,I am awesome.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hell, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"No, he's not."
Leslie Knope,That's not a name.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Torple.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, one time I rode in a sidecar on a guy's motorcycle, and the sidecar detached and went down a flight of stairs."
Leslie Knope,Once I went out with a guy who wore 3D glasses the entire evening.
Leslie Knope,I thought it was terrible wine.
Leslie Knope,"One time, I accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar."
Leslie Knope,"No, there's more."
Leslie Knope,All of these have happened to me.
Leslie Knope,They have happened.
Leslie Knope,"What if instead of Tic Tacs, I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?"
Leslie Knope,What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly?
Leslie Knope,What if he shows up with another woman?
Leslie Knope,"I just have a few more questions for you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,What if I don't bring up Darfur enough?
Leslie Knope,Or not enough?
Leslie Knope,What if I get drunk and I talk about Darfur too much?
Leslie Knope,"Guys like girls that have kids, right?"
Leslie Knope,"The real question is, should I say that I have kids?"
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say that I was married.
Leslie Knope,You know what I'm gonna do?
Leslie Knope,But then he'll wonder why I haven't been married.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What if he asks me if I've been married?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, while I have you, can I ask you a question?"
Leslie Knope,"I think I will, good lady."
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Another time, I went to a really boring movie with a guy, and while I was asleep, he tried to pull out one of my teeth."
Leslie Knope,Just the whole idea of first dates just kind of freak me out.
Leslie Knope,I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth.
Leslie Knope,"I know it sounds crazy, I'm a grown woman, but I am just not good on first dates."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was dropping my niece off."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Dave."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,How big is it?
Leslie Knope,My mind is blank.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I can't think of anything to ask you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What's amazing--
Leslie Knope,Now I'm gonna talk about the local flora and fauna found in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"The Danish call it ""op og ned apparat,"" which literally translated means the ""up and down machine."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Dave You!"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I couldn't think of anything else."
Leslie Knope,They're possible topics of conversation.
Leslie Knope,Let's begin our conversation.
Leslie Knope,"So, Dave."
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Dave, it's me."
Leslie Knope,That's a way better idea.
Leslie Knope,"But let me tell you something, Ann, it never works."
Leslie Knope,"I wear an earpiece, you sit at a table nearby, you speak into a mic, you tell me what to say on the date."
Leslie Knope,I know what you're thinking.
Leslie Knope,"We went out a couple times after that, but then he got weird."
Leslie Knope,But not anymore.
Leslie Knope,I can't even believe that I was scared to go on a date with you.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you should be scared of me."
Leslie Knope,"I think that's better than going with a tried and true 80 step system that led to and I quote ""The most thorough and, dare we say, at times, overprepared presentation that we've seen."""
Leslie Knope,"Sure, yeah, you should probably just rip it."
Leslie Knope,To-- to rip it?
Leslie Knope,That's your plan?
Leslie Knope,It is my very soul.
Leslie Knope,It was developed over thousands of government presentations that I gave over the past ten years.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, no, you cannot drop The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Presentations are upon us, so, Tom, which step are you at in The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System?"
Leslie Knope,"Either way, hell of a game, right, guys?"
Leslie Knope,There aren't that many different types of kangaroos.
Leslie Knope,I mean Doesn't Ron look exactly like a blue flyer?
Leslie Knope,Look at Ron.
Leslie Knope,And look at Ron.
Leslie Knope,So are you and Donna.
Leslie Knope,So am I.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you are a blue flyer."
Leslie Knope,Behold your spirit kangaroo.
Leslie Knope,I came up with a way better game.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Leslie Knope,I can straighten this for you.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Nothing I can do to help?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will start doing an environmental impact study, and Ron, you can do some demographic research."
Leslie Knope,"No, I mean, the lemonade... never mind."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, that's great."
Leslie Knope,"And yeah, that quote came from the Indiana blue ribbon panel on irrigation and drainage."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Big kangaroo.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, I was gone for a while and things are a little different around here, but this is still my house."
Leslie Knope,What do you say?
Leslie Knope,"Now, Stu, I know that you're thinking about retiring, and I am here to ask you to reconsider."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I can barely sit idly by and watch good things happen."
Leslie Knope,I cannot sit idly by and watch this terrible thing happen.
Leslie Knope,"If Tom gives that presentation, it is going to be a total disaster for both him and the department."
Leslie Knope,"You know that, Ron."
Leslie Knope,It's the most effective hair for binder security.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Nothing, good luck."
Leslie Knope,"But I think you're gonna fail, and you're a ticking time bomb."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine, I trust you."
Leslie Knope,"You know, a classic ha ha hmm."
Leslie Knope,And then you need two funny quotes and an inspirational one.
Leslie Knope,You need facts to make your case.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you need hard data."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Content.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it seems like you don't even care about your presentation."
Leslie Knope,"I placed a single strand of hair along the edge, and that secret strand is unbroken."
Leslie Knope,You're lying.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed."
Leslie Knope,When did they put a lamp here?
Leslie Knope,Damn it!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"I invented this parks game, son."
Leslie Knope,And thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that would give us more time."
Leslie Knope,What idea?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I am so sorry for what happened last night.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,God.
Leslie Knope,Should I have?
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is an English accent.
Leslie Knope,We'll put our knickers in The Beatles records.
Leslie Knope,get a pint.
Leslie Knope,To the pub.
Leslie Knope,Let's go down to the pub.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"So, you're gonna give me an elevator home?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, in London, they call elevators ""lifts."""
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Are you impressed that I know what it's called?
Leslie Knope,Can I use your bathroom?
Leslie Knope,"Guess what? I'm wearing the hot one tomorrow, the black one."
Leslie Knope,"Bee, boop."
Leslie Knope,Mmm?
Leslie Knope,Did you see my bra?
Leslie Knope,I can totally tell that he wants me.
Leslie Knope,He wants me.
Leslie Knope,I think it's going pretty well with Dave.
Leslie Knope,I think it fused with my shirt in the dryer or something.
Leslie Knope,I think I need to return this sweater.
Leslie Knope,"On my list of embarrassing things that I've done in my life, that was numbers one through seven."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I totally understand if you wanna cancel.
Leslie Knope,8 o' clock.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,"I get it, but maybe we should stop talking about your insane dog choices and get to working."
Leslie Knope,I'm in on the joke.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,So obviously a cocker spaniel.
Leslie Knope,You guys think I'm a border collie?
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, first morning meeting back in the old conference room."
Leslie Knope,Give me special treatment.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on, it's me."
Leslie Knope,Just tell me I have the job.
Leslie Knope,No more goofing around.
Leslie Knope,"Ha, ha, okay."
Leslie Knope,It's right there in the name: Maintaining our beautiful parks and providing healthy outdoor recreation.
Leslie Knope,Is it good?
Leslie Knope,What are you writing?
Leslie Knope,"The ancient Greek version of the park was the agora, a gathering place where people from all walks of life"
Leslie Knope,No special treatment.
Leslie Knope,Just interview me.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if you'll see on my resume, I held the position of deputy director of parks and recreation for almost ten years."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should have to interview just like everyone else."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I am here to interview for the Deputy Parks Director job."
Leslie Knope,"No fires, no ambulances, just good old-fashioned showing up drunk at a guy's house late at night."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we went on our first date, and I didn't even know it. A.K.A, I nailed it."
Leslie Knope,Then we don't have to go.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Second?
Leslie Knope,I think that would be better.
Leslie Knope,Several hours from now?
Leslie Knope,Tonight?
Leslie Knope,That's really good.
Leslie Knope,Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Form a committee.
Leslie Knope,You know what I need to do?
Leslie Knope,I need bigger guns.
Leslie Knope,I need more firepower.
Leslie Knope,"No, parks are not a priority."
Leslie Knope,How do we make this park happen?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, brainstorm."
Leslie Knope,"I'm a woman, he's a... I think he's a Libyan."
Leslie Knope,We're both outsiders.
Leslie Knope,Tom and I work really well together.
Leslie Knope,You were talking to the mayor?
Leslie Knope,Morning.
Leslie Knope,"But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam."
Leslie Knope,"Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of."
Leslie Knope,"I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land."
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we-- I will help you."
Leslie Knope,I'll do something about it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go on.
Leslie Knope,"Twelve months, yes."
Leslie Knope,Write that down.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, read it back to me."
Leslie Knope,I can do this.
Leslie Knope,It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?
Leslie Knope,"You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for clearing your schedule."
Leslie Knope,I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.
Leslie Knope,Let's get down to brass tacks.
Leslie Knope,You gotta leave the locker room.
Leslie Knope,"City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you... Then you can't take it."
Leslie Knope,You crazy old Polish person.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Brendanawicz?"
Leslie Knope,He just-- He knows where the bodies are buried.
Leslie Knope,"He's a smart, capable guy."
Leslie Knope,He fixes things.
Leslie Knope,He's kind of like a fixer.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that."
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz.
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,What about bringing Mark on board?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,"It's still good, though."
Leslie Knope,Sounded better when I said it.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,He's collecting them for my memoirs.
Leslie Knope,I just need a little help.
Leslie Knope,Tell us about that.
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,It's a great time to be a woman in politics.
Leslie Knope,Women are everywhere.
Leslie Knope,"You know, government isn't just a boys' club anymore."
Leslie Knope,Out of the slide.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wake up."
Leslie Knope,Here we go!
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Get out of the slide.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we're gonna need you to get out."
Leslie Knope,Do you want to come this way?
Leslie Knope,And that might help you slide down a little easier.
Leslie Knope,Could you put your arms to your side?
Leslie Knope,And it feels good to be needed.
Leslie Knope,People need our help.
Leslie Knope,But now things have changed.
Leslie Knope,"""The lines are too long at the DMV."""
Leslie Knope,"""The government stinks."""
Leslie Knope,"""The government."""
Leslie Knope,"You know, when I first tell people that I work in the government, they say, ""Oh."""
Leslie Knope,You're not allowed to sleep in here.
Leslie Knope,"Sir, this is a children's slide."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna put a lot of fun.
Leslie Knope,"Would you say that you are, ""Enjoying yourself and having fun, having a moderate amount of fun and somewhat enjoying yourself, or having no fun and no enjoyment?"""
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a few questions?
Leslie Knope,"My name is Leslie Knope, and I work for the Parks and Recreation Department."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi."
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a good idea.
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,"And if you get motion sickness, you know, put your head between your knees 'cause Leslie Knope's stopping for no one."
Leslie Knope,Anyone else who would like to contribute?
Leslie Knope,Always great to have you here.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, Barry."
Leslie Knope,"These people are members of a community that care about where they live, so what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,I don't like obscenities just as much as you don't like them.
Leslie Knope,"We are here to answer any and all of your questions, so fire away."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, and with me is department member Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,"So, take two."
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting in here.
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"I am the deputy director of the Parks and Recreation Department, and tonight we're gonna be taking some of your questions as--"
Leslie Knope,My name is Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,What an amazing turnout.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's locked.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Like the White House Press Secretary.
Leslie Knope,"When I go through these doors, I need to be on."
Leslie Knope,This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings.
Leslie Knope,This is a great thing for you guys to see.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,And that is tonight.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I like to tell people, you know, ""Get on board and buckle up, because my ride's gonna be a big one."""
Leslie Knope,"Keep that Lafayette Park stand open, pumpin' out the stew like you do."
Leslie Knope,"Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?"
Leslie Knope,"When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen."
Leslie Knope,America is awesome.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"Should I call a press conference now, or--"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"It's exciting, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it great?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I'm a rocket ship.
Leslie Knope,"I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,That's so exciting! This is huge.
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you want to see? The DMV? Animal control? Or we could--"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster."
Leslie Knope,It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.
Leslie Knope,It's one of our best murals.
Leslie Knope,This is our crown jewel.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"So this was built in 1935, it's called Pioneer Hall. And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks."
Leslie Knope,My clavicle's still really hurting me.
Leslie Knope,Oh man.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't think I even want it."
Leslie Knope,Someone on the phone about the park.
Leslie Knope,Everybody wants to know what your decision is.
Leslie Knope,I'll ask him.
Leslie Knope,It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.
Leslie Knope,"All right, all right."
Leslie Knope,You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Helping already.
Leslie Knope,"What about, like, a sexy hat?"
Leslie Knope,"Like, I don't know, a pair of cargo pants?"
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a first date outfit I can borrow?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, listen, I'm really nervous about this date tomorrow night."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That was my phone.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to be nervous about.
Leslie Knope,We're just two people going on a first date.
Leslie Knope,Why should I be nervous?
Leslie Knope,I'm not nervous.
Leslie Knope,Dave and I are going on our first date tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Over and out.
Leslie Knope,Copy.
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, will be our first official... First date."
Leslie Knope,What are you guys doing?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, I heard he was."
Leslie Knope,Not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex.
Leslie Knope,"Personally, all I care about is Councilman Dexhart's policies."
Leslie Knope,I think it's a real shame when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Sweet Lady Marmalard
Leslie Knope,"Soul sista, soul sista Gonna get your phone, sista"
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,You gotta be ready for it.
Leslie Knope,Mark and I-- It's complicated.
Leslie Knope,"All right, you guys."
Leslie Knope,Lot 46 thoughts? Yes? No? Me? Park?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I have a hard hat on.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,I'm going in.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,But why not try?
Leslie Knope,It's gonna take a little extra work.
Leslie Knope,We could do some of those things.
Leslie Knope,We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.
Leslie Knope,"Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park?
Leslie Knope,"Dream with me for a second, Ann."
Leslie Knope,How did we let this happen?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"How you doing, son?"
Leslie Knope,The man heard 'round the world.
Leslie Knope,This must be our hero.
Leslie Knope,She's going to be documenting our fact finding mission.
Leslie Knope,"And this is our college intern, April."
Leslie Knope,You remember Tom from last night.
Leslie Knope,Safety.
Leslie Knope,I'm here.
Leslie Knope,It's Ms. Perkins' house.
Leslie Knope,We slept together.
Leslie Knope,"April, document this."
Leslie Knope,Giving the park to me?
Leslie Knope,"The key to any factfinding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, I presume."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.
Leslie Knope,I like the sound of that definitely.
Leslie Knope,What it means is I want this subcommittee.
Leslie Knope,"And let me tell you something, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means."
Leslie Knope,When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact finding mission.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have."
Leslie Knope,When you've been down in the pit-- Have you been in the pit?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you."
Leslie Knope,Let me have Lot 48.
Leslie Knope,Give me my shot.
Leslie Knope,I've been a loyal foot soldier.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Are pancakes being made?
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, my clavicle's broken."
Leslie Knope,Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle."
Leslie Knope,After my head hit that rod.
Leslie Knope,Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,Mmmmmm.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.
Leslie Knope,"Stu, you have been a staple in the parks department system for years."
Leslie Knope,Retirement is for the birds.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna be so bored.
Leslie Knope,And the Sanitation Department is stretched a little thin.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, there has been some confusion with some of the garbage routes."
Leslie Knope,You have a comment?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, caller."
Leslie Knope,Guys... Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Did you just say the word ""scoff""?"
Leslie Knope,"But overall, the state of the merger is very strong."
Leslie Knope,And a rather large-scale brawl at the dump.
Leslie Knope,And a brief rash of arson.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there were some bumps and bruises."
Leslie Knope,And the crust of those little pizzas was made of chocolate.
Leslie Knope,It was a pizza whose crust was stuffed with little pizzas.
Leslie Knope,I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad since Frankie's discontinued their pizza stuffed crust pizza.
Leslie Knope,There's still a little animosity between the two towns.
Leslie Knope,Things are going... okay.
Leslie Knope,It's been a couple of months since Pawnee and Eagleton officially merged.
Leslie Knope,"As a listener, I think the merging of your two shows has really created such a big, quiet, arcane ball of fun."
Leslie Knope,It's a thrill to be here.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just want to say thank you so much for having me."
Leslie Knope,It's like Whaaaat?
Leslie Knope,"He makes the cutest, dopiest face when he's surprised."
Leslie Knope,"And then, bam, I surprise him with the best gift of all time."
Leslie Knope,And Ben always believes me.
Leslie Knope,I always say that I'm not gonna get him a gift.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm getting him a gift."
Leslie Knope,No gifts.
Leslie Knope,No gifts.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's what the merger is."
Leslie Knope,And no gifts.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know who this is, but I agree."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this merger needs a win-- something symbolic and bright and happy that will show that there's light at the end of the tunnel."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,We-- Hey!
Leslie Knope,Now is not the time.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you did, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"No, and I'm now just realizing how misleading this giant check is."
Leslie Knope,A golden anniversary celebration.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, you didn't win any money, you won something better than money."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mrs. DeMarco, I am Leslie Knope, and we saw your announcement in the newspaper and we would love to treat you and your husband to a very special day."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, obviously, we don't really know these people, so let's keep things fun and positive and celebratory, and mergery."
Leslie Knope,I'm getting the epiphany sweats.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna hold them up as an example of Pawnee Eagleton unity.
Leslie Knope,A Pawnee Eagleton couple that has been married for 50 years is a perfect symbol of how our towns can get along.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is perfect."
Leslie Knope,"""Rosie Hails from Pawnee, while Doug is originally from the former Eagleton."""
Leslie Knope,They've been married for 50 years.
Leslie Knope,Rosie and Doug DeMarco.
Leslie Knope,This is a picture of an elderly couple.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, this is a picture of us."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton were as happy as Ben and me.
Leslie Knope,What are you still doing here?
Leslie Knope,Larry!
Leslie Knope,Please leave.
Leslie Knope,"Now is not the time, Larry."
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so stressed."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,We'll give you some money.
Leslie Knope,Dinner at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,They cut it way down.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,And can we still be on the phone for every state of the Union address and every Oscar red carpet coverage and every single viewing of Tootsie?
Leslie Knope,Can I still call you when I have thoughts on Jennifer Aniston's future?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,Did I miss a nice moment?
Leslie Knope,"And if one comes close, make yourself really large like a puffer fish."
Leslie Knope,You have to hiss really loud and stomp your feet so they'll leave you alone.
Leslie Knope,It's for the raccoons.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I am gonna call the official ceremonial ribbon cutting guy, 'cause I think we may have missed him."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Victory at last.
Leslie Knope,"Harold, your tiny brain could not understand this, but that is the best compliment you could ever give the two women standing in front of you."
Leslie Knope,Now call off your guards.
Leslie Knope,Everything's here in writing.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so we got Perd Hapley to sign on with Sweetums, which means that you get your sodas back, which means that we get our key."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It was absolutely the right call.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky minx."
Leslie Knope,Does that mean-- no!
Leslie Knope,For old time's sake?
Leslie Knope,"We know that you were already approached by Sweetums and you said ""No,"" but is there any way you would reconsider?"
Leslie Knope,I don't think this new sports drink is even about basketball.
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Perkins."
Leslie Knope,You perfect sunflower.
Leslie Knope,At lease 100 kisses.
Leslie Knope,"You totally changed me, you know? You taught me how to balance my life, how to be patient."
Leslie Knope,How to throw bureaucratic caution to the wind when it came to Ben.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,"You wrote this, didn't you?"
Leslie Knope,"""And the groom wore a butt so perfect it could make an angel hang itself."""
Leslie Knope,"""The bride wore a gown made by her friend Ann Perkins."""
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt were married one year ago this week at the Pawnee city hall."""
Leslie Knope,Raise you hand if you want waffles.
Leslie Knope,My eyes are basically useless right now.
Leslie Knope,Someone else is gonna have to drive though.
Leslie Knope,That's fair.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,I love you too.
Leslie Knope,Things are gonna get emotional.
Leslie Knope,"There's a lot of Sarah McLanahan, so, Chris, I apologize."
Leslie Knope,"So-- oh, and there's a mix CD that I made already loaded in your car."
Leslie Knope,I packed you some sandwiches and some caffeine free iced tea.
Leslie Knope,Drive safe.
Leslie Knope,No big deal.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, this is normal."
Leslie Knope,"But if there is no one actually good enough for her, you are pretty damn close."
Leslie Knope,And I still think that.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, and I just want you to know that I thought there was no man on earth good enough for Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,Chris Traeger.
Leslie Knope,"Don't even joke about that, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three!"
Leslie Knope,Either he flaked or he tripped and impaled himself on his own giant scissors.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't think this ceremonial ribbon cutting guy is gonna make it."
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, you taught me that I can't pull off a tulip skirt."
Leslie Knope,How to be more patient.
Leslie Knope,How dare you--
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Everybody give 'em money.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shoot."
Leslie Knope,I was looking at a very adorable stroller.
Leslie Knope,I have some gift ideas.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So cute!
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"What are you doing up there in space, baby?"
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make mine look like an astronaut.
Leslie Knope,"Three main activities: baby bingo, baby food tasting, and my personal favorite baby onesie decorating station."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk plans for Diane's baby shower.
Leslie Knope,Enough's enough.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Our starship is in trouble.
Leslie Knope,He's a bigger Game of Thrones fan than you are.
Leslie Knope,I had a guy at the model store make a replica.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,Happy anniversary.
Leslie Knope,About that.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, this is a little rough, but you have a lot of talent here."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and your scrapbook instincts are really good."
Leslie Knope,You planned all of this for me? An enchanted carriage? This is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my eff-ing God."
Leslie Knope,Ahem.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to think of something else.
Leslie Knope,Like-- what you do there.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, whose baby is that?"
Leslie Knope,Ron has a baby!
Leslie Knope,"People are gonna clap, they're gonna cheer."
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect place for the press conference to announce our unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Here we are the park that borders Pawnee and Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,And that banner unfurling marks the 100th time that one of my projects has been ahead of schedule.
Leslie Knope,"And with that update, the Pawnee new founder's day unity concert is now officially ahead of schedule!"
Leslie Knope,I have asked Grant to declare Eagleton Hills a national park as the grand finale of our unity concert.
Leslie Knope,"He's basically the Tim Dweck-- Okay, never mind."
Leslie Knope,The department of the interior's resident bad boy?
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville?
Leslie Knope,He's basically the Liam Bonneville of the Midwest.
Leslie Knope,"No, Grant Larson is the director of the Midwest branch of the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,No one knows who that is?
Leslie Knope,I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.
Leslie Knope,You guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.
Leslie Knope,"I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario."
Leslie Knope,"But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success, Pawnee might once again tolerate slash ignore me."
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Eagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town."
Leslie Knope,"Craig, any update on the art tents?"
Leslie Knope,Stop suggesting Orin.
Leslie Knope,Madison.
Leslie Knope,Update on the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, youth committee."
Leslie Knope,When did you get a fish?
Leslie Knope,"She's just walking around, wondering why I haven't sent her a gift yet."
Leslie Knope,I have not even sent Diane a gift.
Leslie Knope,"Why would I-- oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"How am I supposed to keep my voice down when you had your baby, and you didn't tell me that you had your baby?"
Leslie Knope,"Guys, get in here!"
Leslie Knope,"Here, here's some money."
Leslie Knope,"You guys, that's like-- I don't know-- Amazing."
Leslie Knope,So why don't we call this first meeting a success and then we'll get together later in the week.
Leslie Knope,"I orchestrated the Pawnee Eagleton merger, and I was hoping that your marriage could show people that a happy union is possible."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to admit something.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,We need to get ready.
Leslie Knope,"Joan, if we could just have a moment."
Leslie Knope,"That's what this is, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Ah, the playful banter of a couple on the same team."
Leslie Knope,"In just a few minutes, you are going to be professing your love on television."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, isn't this exciting?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's just hope that deep down these two still love each other."
Leslie Knope,They're sort of grumpy.
Leslie Knope,I'm kind of worried about putting these two on live TV.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna recreate your wedding photo from 50 years ago.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you two, head on up there."
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at dinner.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,Can it wait?
Leslie Knope,I'm out saving the merger.
Leslie Knope,I'm not even in my office.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, babe."
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Let's get started!
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"So when you're out there, if you could just, you know, look back over the past 50 years together and focus on the good times, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I don't-- I don't-- I don't even-- You know what I mean?
Leslie Knope,Isn't love grand?
Leslie Knope,"No, I--"
Leslie Knope,"From out there, it looks like you guys were having some fun, getting to know each other."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so it's been an hour."
Leslie Knope,"You get to B.S.-ing, brainstorming."
Leslie Knope,So we are gonna order you some 'zzas.
Leslie Knope,"You are going to meet twice a week and you're here because of your energy, and your youth, and for some of you, your mental age, and you're going to find a way to make this merger stick."
Leslie Knope,"Now, April says that young people think the word ""committee"" is lame, so let's just think of this as a like a super chill, fun e-hangout."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, the people in this room are the first members of the Pawnee Eagleton Youth Committee."
Leslie Knope,Did you put saffron in here? It makes the shellfish taste delicious.
Leslie Knope,"Damn, this paella is good."
Leslie Knope,We're having dinner.
Leslie Knope,But not now.
Leslie Knope,I think we should go to work
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna need your help on something.
Leslie Knope,"Whitney Houston knew it, and so do you, and so do I."
Leslie Knope,The children are our future.
Leslie Knope,The children.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Cheers.
Leslie Knope,Maybe Pawneeans and Eagletonians aren't meant to coexist.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,What is he doing right now?
Leslie Knope,I wish Ben was here.
Leslie Knope,"Gah, I don't know what to do."
Leslie Knope,Who likes tap dancing?
Leslie Knope,"We all agree that marriages have their ups and downs, but at the end of the day, they're worth it becauseâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta.
Leslie Knope,"50 years of marriage, helping to bridge the meaningless divide between Pawnee and Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,I should probably empty my pockets just in case.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Kathryn, always a delight."
Leslie Knope,Don't leave.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.
Leslie Knope,There's your reason.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am not a prude, but the point is, people shouldn't be half naked, you know, in public, in the middle of the day, in front of children."
Leslie Knope,I'm just very good at that.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Porn on the cob.
Leslie Knope,The reason is it's vegetable porn.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it would be very easy for you to revoke their license."
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I was thinking more about that chard guy."
Leslie Knope,Put those away.
Leslie Knope,"Connie, no."
Leslie Knope,A little iffy?
Leslie Knope,"I don't like vegetables, but I'm very good at vegetable puns."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and ""In case of fire, romaine calm,"" and ""You won't bay leaf how nice olive our vendors are."""
Leslie Knope,They're violating every single one of the farmers market's rules of conduct.
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're the city manager."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, do something."
Leslie Knope,What the hell is going on?
Leslie Knope,What's good today?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Connie Cabbage."
Leslie Knope,"It's good for the economy, it's good for families, and it's good for promoting a healthy lifestyle, which Pawnee desperately needs."
Leslie Knope,Opening this farmers market was one of my greatest achievements as city councilor.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I think our love made him angry.
Leslie Knope,That's smart.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Home is home, and work is work."
Leslie Knope,"Mmhmm, yeah, uh-huh."
Leslie Knope,And we will solve this chard issue once and for all.
Leslie Knope,"Instead, fellow employee, I will meet you in the basement conference room at 6:00 P.M."
Leslie Knope,"If we go home, the firewall is up, and then you don't have to deal with me anymore."
Leslie Knope,I know what you're trying to do.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Judas!
Leslie Knope,"But if it's so gross, you should just sell something else."
Leslie Knope,I like to think of it as celery with B.O.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, back me up on this without hesitation."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Nolan, under the auspices of the office of city manager, et cetera, et cetera, it's not important, you are in violation of many rules, and therefore you cannot sell your goods anymore at the Pawnee farmers market."
Leslie Knope,The train has left the station.
Leslie Knope,"Either way, it's too late."
Leslie Knope,Those apply to all vendors.
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, did you get a chance to sign off on that booklet I gave you?"
Leslie Knope,"Good day, colleague."
Leslie Knope,You can eat those once you revoke the chard vendor's license.
Leslie Knope,The surprise is there's toffee in the inside.
Leslie Knope,I also made these: Leslie's toffee surprise.
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night.
Leslie Knope,The new farmers market rule book.
Leslie Knope,"So if you're looking for a reason to kick them out, here's 158."
Leslie Knope,"The farmers market is a community meeting place, and that pansexual stripper show basically negates the whole purpose."
Leslie Knope,"We pulled into the parking lot, and this is technically city hall property, so now we're at work let's do this."
Leslie Knope,"Firewall, man."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I found a legal precedent to shut down those vegetable smut peddlers."
Leslie Knope,We can always talk about this tomorrow at the office.
Leslie Knope,Don't forget your approval pen.
Leslie Knope,Group hug!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's not let Ron feel left out."
Leslie Knope,"Making stew is hard: Up at the crack of dawn, backbreaking labor, your clothes smelling like salt and gristle."
Leslie Knope,"And then he realized, ""No, I wanna spend my time in a small metal box all summer, bent over a boiling cauldron of steaming, bubbling meat."""
Leslie Knope,"Here's a man who was ready to retire, spend time with his family, travel."
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, it's because of Stu."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but still, Tom is all flash and no substance."
Leslie Knope,Larry still can't see purple.
Leslie Knope,The botched laser show?
Leslie Knope,Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I love Tom, but you and I both know that he's not ready to step up."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"I'm still doing my stew presentation, and we'll see which one the committee likes."
Leslie Knope,"The point is you weren't ready for this, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"No, I use the juicy space thing-- whatever you do."
Leslie Knope,"Doin' what, putting mousse in your hair?"
Leslie Knope,So pressure's off.
Leslie Knope,"I know you were excited to get in front of the committee and rip it, but in the spirit of teamwork, I unilaterally decided to bring Stu out of retirement."
Leslie Knope,I just saved your bacon.
Leslie Knope,"Great news, guys."
Leslie Knope,That's very hot.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,To stew.
Leslie Knope,You just keep on stewin' what you stew.
Leslie Knope,I'll take care of it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're gonna need to convince the business council to keep you around, but that's not for you to worry about."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Screw bisque.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say this because you need to hear it.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, profits are minimal, but Stu doesn't care about that."
Leslie Knope,"We love you too, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Maybe a year extension isn't enough.
Leslie Knope,"Heck, why don't we give him a lifetime deal?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's great news, 'cause I'm in love with you too."
Leslie Knope,What!
Leslie Knope,Naked in bed.
Leslie Knope,We rehearsed that at home.
Leslie Knope,Sentences!
Leslie Knope,And we are so In sync
Leslie Knope,We live together
Leslie Knope,And awesome.
Leslie Knope,"I am back at the parks department, and Ben is city manager, but we're married, so it's kosher."
Leslie Knope,And I have to say that the way that you're rockin' those slacks is quite impressive as well.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you very much, Mr. City Manager."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it has taken--"
Leslie Knope,"And because you created Tom's position-- business liaison-- and it's already financially paying off, you have received Pawnee's government employee of the month."
Leslie Knope,"I know you don't open your mail, but I do."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that reminds me."
Leslie Knope,Was that a death threat?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, does this department even need me anymore?"
Leslie Knope,April runs Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom's come into his own."
Leslie Knope,Tom has really grown up.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, you were right."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Rip it.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I'd like to see Stu ladling out his pungent beef smoothies until we bury him under that shed.
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should make it five years.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there is."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, 6:00."
Leslie Knope,"Harold, it is Leslie Knope again."
Leslie Knope,Stay in character.
Leslie Knope,"Until I say so, Orin!"
Leslie Knope,Get here and we will make a plan.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's that stupid Harold who's behind this."
Leslie Knope,I love them both equally.
Leslie Knope,And Sasha.
Leslie Knope,Holy mother of Malia!
Leslie Knope,Do they mean the professor?
Leslie Knope,They probably mean him.
Leslie Knope,There's a professor in Copenhagen named Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie Knope is a very common name."
Leslie Knope,That probably doesn't apply to us.
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?
Leslie Knope,Are you on the lot?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron, have you seen April?"
Leslie Knope,Have fun!
Leslie Knope,Don't drink!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, party!"
Leslie Knope,Ain't no party like a Leslie Knope party 'cause a Leslie Knope party is actually 30 parties.
Leslie Knope,"Your birthday, New Year's, Chinese New Year's, flag day."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know when we're gonna be able to visit each other, so just to be safe this party is a celebration of every event that's gonna happen this year."
Leslie Knope,That's sparkling cider.
Leslie Knope,"Bon voyage, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"I know you are screening my calls, but if you could call me bac;k-- And his voicemail is full."
Leslie Knope,Repeat that back to me.
Leslie Knope,Did you have any luck?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's perfect."
Leslie Knope,Kathryn Pinewood is the person on earth who hates me the most.
Leslie Knope,It is not easy.
Leslie Knope,Easy.
Leslie Knope,Sorry?
Leslie Knope,We need the key to the fence that you put up on the Sullivan Street lot.
Leslie Knope,Harold.
Leslie Knope,Love it!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, knock or ring the bell?"
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Here we go, Ann."
Leslie Knope,That's my bad.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I didn't plan what we were all gonna say."
Leslie Knope,Groundbreaking!
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hands in, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Ann Perkins to the rescue.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann."
Leslie Knope,He put a barbed wire fence around the lot and now it's not happening.
Leslie Knope,But now we can't do it because Harold is such a jerk face.
Leslie Knope,"You know, an actual beginning to the project that brought us together."
Leslie Knope,We were planning a surprise groundbreaking at Pawnee commons for you.
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,What is the point of being married to a city manager if he can't wield unfettered power to crush my enemies?
Leslie Knope,I made it for you last night.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't mention anything about the groundbreaking to Ann."
Leslie Knope,"April, thank you."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's nice."
Leslie Knope,I am super chill all the time!
Leslie Knope,That is totally crazy!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I thought you agreed with me.
Leslie Knope,Why are you not supporting me on this?
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"It is 40 degrees, and we are standing in freezing water."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is insane."
Leslie Knope,Let's dance.
Leslie Knope,"You can't escape city hall, fool!"
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee reservoir.
Leslie Knope,Guess where the water comes from.
Leslie Knope,The concrete that you're standing on was poured by a municipal construction crew.
Leslie Knope,Hahaha!
Leslie Knope,Mother
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,We're just getting started.
Leslie Knope,"Stay frosty, Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,Firewall down.
Leslie Knope,"All roads and bridges fall under the purview of the Pawnee department of transportation, which is located on the fourth floor of city hall."
Leslie Knope,Wrong.
Leslie Knope,What the hell are you doing out here?
Leslie Knope,Read.
Leslie Knope,Larry?
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,I should have considered your side.
Leslie Knope,"I know you may tease Ann, but deep down inside I can tell that you really care."
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and you're also a very smart person."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,See you tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, right?"
Leslie Knope,Hazelnut.
Leslie Knope,You should come by.
Leslie Knope,There's gonna be a lot of these at the party.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Would you like a treat?
Leslie Knope,I will make a note of that.
Leslie Knope,Understood.
Leslie Knope,"Look, your office was giving me a hard time, so I had to call in a few favors."
Leslie Knope,Harold.
Leslie Knope,That was our biggest fight.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, ice cream sandwich taste test!"
Leslie Knope,"I have secretly arranged to officially break ground on Pawnee commons at midnight, fulfilling my pinky promise that I made five years ago."
Leslie Knope,That promise launched a friendship so grand it takes 103 scrapbooks to capture it.
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.
Leslie Knope,I will help you.
Leslie Knope,It all goes back to when I first met my best friend.
Leslie Knope,Tonight's biggest surprise is 5 years in the making.
Leslie Knope,"And if she casually mentioned 3 years ago that she thought indoor fireworks would be cool then guess what, you're gonna give me indoor fireworks."
Leslie Knope,"Look I am throwing a farewell party for my best friend, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, you can't?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's like a tree barfed in my mouth."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody, it is now 5:00 P.M., which means the farmers market is closed."
Leslie Knope,"Nolan, I'm very sorry that I overreacted and overstepped my bounds."
Leslie Knope,I can't because my legs are numb.
Leslie Knope,You're a magnificent asker-outer.
Leslie Knope,Committee?
Leslie Knope,Viva America! Viva Pawnee! Viva Mayor Walter Gunderson!
Leslie Knope,Habitat for Humanity? No.
Leslie Knope,Is it Teach for America? No.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,How did it go?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Say hi to your daughters.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, she's here."
Leslie Knope,Tell me another Yeltsin story.
Leslie Knope,"Talk to me, okay? Your voice makes me calm."
Leslie Knope,It's working with animals.
Leslie Knope,"They're taking forever, and I'm starting to lose it."
Leslie Knope,That a girl.
Leslie Knope,I'll wait right here.
Leslie Knope,Go solve all of your career problems.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to send you another one.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you changed your hair."
Leslie Knope,Not my best work.
Leslie Knope,They contacted us last year because they wanted to place some people in National Parks.
Leslie Knope,"Alyssa, this is April Ludgate, the single greatest human being ever, and you need to find her a job that she will love and cherish and make her life feel complete."
Leslie Knope,"They take young people like you who are trying to explore a new path, and match them with one of the thousands of jobs across America that help communities."
Leslie Knope,"April, this is Alyssa, from the American Service Foundation."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Madeleine."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"I am 100,000% in support of this idea."
Leslie Knope,This is an amazing idea.
Leslie Knope,None of your business.
Leslie Knope,I'm standing right here in front of you.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,"We're just focusing on bigger issues, like Ben's 150 million dollar revitalization project."
Leslie Knope,We're-- I'm not making any kind of statement.
Leslie Knope,Last contest's loser was all women.
Leslie Knope,The last contest's winner was June Hartwell's buttermilk meringue.
Leslie Knope,"The Pie Mary is a Southern Indiana tradition, where Congressional candidates' wives face off in a pie baking contest."
Leslie Knope,"Stephen, be careful."
Leslie Knope,I think you're underestimating the voters.
Leslie Knope,I know all the issues inside and out.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was an actual candidate, so I think I can handle being a candidate's wife."
Leslie Knope,"Me, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,I love watching those squashes fly through the air.
Leslie Knope,We have to skip that?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"One of my five favorite types of talk, along with pillow, girl, real, and TED."
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, shop talk."
Leslie Knope,But you can get this sucker on your own.
Leslie Knope,"Obviously, I'm going to vet your resume and we'll hold some mock-interviews and I'll choose your outfit and everything."
Leslie Knope,You can get any job you want all by yourself.
Leslie Knope,"April, you don't need me."
Leslie Knope,You wanted to run something by me?
Leslie Knope,"So, are they hiring? What did Alyssa say when you told her?"
Leslie Knope,And I love you.
Leslie Knope,I love this idea.
Leslie Knope,I know some people who might be able to help us.
Leslie Knope,I am on the case.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here's the good news."
Leslie Knope,"So, you don't have any idea what you want to do?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,He's been helping you behind my back?
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt?
Leslie Knope,Ben who?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,You quit?
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,"April, we have a bench in D.C."
Leslie Knope,"This is going to be our city, and this is going to be our bench."
Leslie Knope,We are about to embark on such an amazing journey.
Leslie Knope,I keep a local bindermaker on retainer in D.C.
Leslie Knope,And here it is.
Leslie Knope,Which means that you're going to need a new five year plan.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am so ahead of my five year plan."
Leslie Knope,"No, they put that in in the '70s."
Leslie Knope,For us.
Leslie Knope,"For us, April."
Leslie Knope,"I am going to take that job, Ben's going to run for Congress, he will win eventually, and then we're going to split our time between Washington and Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,I see a new home.
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Leslie Knope,"Look around, April."
Leslie Knope,Ma'am?
Leslie Knope,I just want to throw it up in the air victoriously.
Leslie Knope,Do you mind if I borrow your hat?
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,And thank you for noticing.
Leslie Knope,We had a good run.
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you're quitting.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, April."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know you do.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What? Why?
Leslie Knope,"If you feel like you need to move on, I totally get it."
Leslie Knope,"I really want all of my friends to be happy together, but more importantly, I just want them to be happy."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I blew up at you yesterday.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,It just makes me feel very powerful.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for letting me wear it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"You're right, once again, Madeleine Albright."
Leslie Knope,Name one time I've done that.
Leslie Knope,"Well, because when I knew I would be coming to Washington to work, I wore you down until you agreed to become my friend."
Leslie Knope,"Well, eight if you count all those times I showed up unannounced at your office with mini muffins."
Leslie Knope,Five.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"It's like, what's the point, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I love her, but you spend so much time and effort on someone's life and she's just going to quit on me?"
Leslie Knope,It's just so frustrating.
Leslie Knope,"And on our bench, of all places."
Leslie Knope,And I cannot believe this is the first time I'm hearing it.
Leslie Knope,But he's dead to me now.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it only took three hours for Jen to be right."
Leslie Knope,I'm officially a distraction.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna enter that Pie Mary.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,On this Earth.
Leslie Knope,As individuals.
Leslie Knope,We're all just trying to find the right path for us.
Leslie Knope,Just don't judge what someone else has decided to do.
Leslie Knope,"Do both, or neither, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna have a career, that's great, too."
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna bake a pie, that's great."
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Leslie Knope,"My mom, babe."
Leslie Knope,"And then, you know, sometimes I don't."
Leslie Knope,Everybody does.
Leslie Knope,"""Do you miss your kids while you're at work?"" Yes, of course I do."
Leslie Knope,Don't ask it.
Leslie Knope,Stop asking it.
Leslie Knope,It's a stupid question.
Leslie Knope,"""Are you trying to have it all?"" That question makes no sense."
Leslie Knope,Or my kids got gum in it.
Leslie Knope,I just thought it would look better.
Leslie Knope,"""Why did I change my hairstyle?"" Oh, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,"Third, I'm now gonna give you permanent answers to all the silly questions that you're gonna end up asking me, and every other woman in this election, over the next few months."
Leslie Knope,"You're ridiculous, and men's rights is nothing."
Leslie Knope,"Second, the Male Men. Where are you? Ah."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that the spotlight is on me and not on Ben, because he is going to make a great congressman."
Leslie Knope,The first thing I'm gonna do is say sorry.
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,That seems about right.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,He just spoke.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I never trust anything that comes that quickly.
Leslie Knope,"And we're all volunteering for Kaboom, a service organization that says it builds a playground in a day."
Leslie Knope,It's two towns over.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're here in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,It's for my lower back.
Leslie Knope,Daniel Craig.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Just cancel the credit card and we'll all go on with our lives.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't have to refund anything."
Leslie Knope,So why don't you just cancel it?
Leslie Knope,I think someone definitely stole my credit card.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,"Also something called ""Bucket of Cake."""
Leslie Knope,"Man Pillow, the pillow shaped like a man?"
Leslie Knope,"It was a moneyback guarantee, but I forgot to return them."
Leslie Knope,"Okay-- Um, I wore those once."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm gonna take you off speaker phone."
Leslie Knope,Potions.
Leslie Knope,It's fun.
Leslie Knope,"They give you a little wand, and a diploma."
Leslie Knope,I needed all eleven disks of Gossip Girl at the same time.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Son of a bitch.
Leslie Knope,What did I do wrong now?
Leslie Knope,"To the best of my recollection, yes, I accept the job."
Leslie Knope,"Recently, I made an attempt to--"
Leslie Knope,Very temperate.
Leslie Knope,Then it just seems like I'm saying I'm better than the women who bake.
Leslie Knope,Then we're just back where we started.
Leslie Knope,Do you know how many anti-me signs that could buy?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ben, I gave them 100 dollars in their annual pledge."
Leslie Knope,"Which normally is why I love them, but now I'm on the other side."
Leslie Knope,The IOW does not mess around.
Leslie Knope,"And my husband, Ben, is a progressive champion of women's rights."
Leslie Knope,There is no bigger defender of gender equality than Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Elise.
Leslie Knope,It's the way to go.
Leslie Knope,That kind of thing.
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, lose a battle, win the war."
Leslie Knope,"But this is not about me, it's about Ben, and he will do more for women than Hartwell."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I agree that it's dumb."
Leslie Knope,Right now?
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see it?
Leslie Knope,I have a speech prepared.
Leslie Knope,Are you here to give me the Woman of the Year award?
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Please, come in."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my goodness, Elise."
Leslie Knope,That might be one of the kids.
Leslie Knope,You know me so well.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, snacks given, kids tucked in, books read, three simultaneous meltdowns for no reason, kids tucked back in, one of them briefly got outside somehow, kids back in bed, they're all napping."
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I'm good at making pies, so I'll win and then I can promote my self-published women's rights barbecue cookbook The Feminine Mesquite."
Leslie Knope,"But the more they talk about this, the less they're gonna talk about your economic plan."
Leslie Knope,What should we do?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Should we get a divorce?
Leslie Knope,"We sidestep the controversy, we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate."
Leslie Knope,How about this weather we're having?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,He has five personalized aprons.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He loves to cook.
Leslie Knope,I'm not forcing him to do anything!
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!
Leslie Knope,What's happening now?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,How is your dessert calzone?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,How's your pie?
Leslie Knope,The IOW is not gonna protest us.
Leslie Knope,We're good.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Get in there and start baking.
Leslie Knope,"Of course you can, baby."
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,A pie.
Leslie Knope,"I feel like that's not more important, but I like the energy that we have, so let's hear it."
Leslie Knope,And then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that could work."
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Leslie Knope,Try this.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, you're thinking about Jen's offer?"
Leslie Knope,I don't want to --
Leslie Knope,I have a dream job.
Leslie Knope,"Jen, I told you."
Leslie Knope,I have never been late for an event that requires an RSVP.
Leslie Knope,"Jen, thank you so much for coming but we have to go."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,Jen?
Leslie Knope,"Let's just make, like, three more so that each one of them can have a friend."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we make some more kids?
Leslie Knope,A little privacy.
Leslie Knope,A little down time.
Leslie Knope,"It's been three years, we deserve one night away together."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, our lives are so chaotic, we can't run a campaign."
Leslie Knope,The whole world is my park.
Leslie Knope,"And I'll say, ""Jen, thank you very much, that's very flattering but I love my job and I get to do it for the entire country."""
Leslie Knope,"She'll just say what she always says, which is, ""Leslie, would you consider running for state Senate or Congress?"""
Leslie Knope,She's relentless.
Leslie Knope,Jen Barkley is calling again.
Leslie Knope,But if you left me I would never recover.
Leslie Knope,"If Ben left me, I would be sad but I would get through it."
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I love you more than Ben.
Leslie Knope,And you're an excellent caretaker for our children.
Leslie Knope,You're tough and strong.
Leslie Knope,"Tonight, just act like you've decided to run."
Leslie Knope,You are a wonderful nanny.
Leslie Knope,"And then tomorrow, at the wedding, act like you've decided not to run."
Leslie Knope,Ben has to run.
Leslie Knope,"Toast it, baby."
Leslie Knope,"Because if you were running for Congress, you have to give speeches, right?"
Leslie Knope,You should give a toast.
Leslie Knope,You know what you should do?
Leslie Knope,"Ever since we had our kids, it only takes, like, one sip of wine."
Leslie Knope,I am too.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, you are killing it."
Leslie Knope,Work your magic.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Here's Donna's parents, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Let's try someone else.
Leslie Knope,Too hard.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Your goal is to act like everyone is interesting and important.
Leslie Knope,"You remember how this goes, right?"
Leslie Knope,"So first up, meet and greet."
Leslie Knope,"Starting now, you're in campaign mode."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I will support you no matter what you do.
Leslie Knope,I'm completely neutral.
Leslie Knope,Ben should be the Royal Archduke Sultan Emperor of all inhabitable lands on Earth.
Leslie Knope,Good for the world.
Leslie Knope,He would be good for America.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to push it because it might backfire but he has to run.
Leslie Knope,See which one feels better.
Leslie Knope,Roast it and toast it till it's brown on both sides!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Roz, Roz."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,But how would we... PR.
Leslie Knope,Are you thinkingâ¦
Leslie Knope,Medical Waste Butt Sweat Grove.
Leslie Knope,A more accurate name for this place?
Leslie Knope,"Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name, Beachview Terrace."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and 10 years ago, when he was elected, he promised to clean it up."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to Beachview Terrace, the sad, unsalvageable, broken down armpit of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Anything to get away from this cologne smell.
Leslie Knope,I'm in.
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I love your energy, Andy, but it's not gonna help us keep JJ's where it is."
Leslie Knope,"This is a lost cause, just like my stupid park."
Leslie Knope,"I am sorry, JJ, that I gave you false hope."
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the devil, Dennis Feinstein."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, speak of the devil."
Leslie Knope,Like JJ's Diner.
Leslie Knope,We need to preserve the things that make Pawnee great.
Leslie Knope,We can't bulldoze our entire history.
Leslie Knope,When do we want it?
Leslie Knope,What do we want?
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,"So, now, let's hear from a man who knows the value of things staying the same."
Leslie Knope,"You stick to the breakfast, I'll deal with the politics."
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""constructing a narrative,"" JJ."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have about five days to do three months' worth of work, but if we pull it off, we can rescue JJ's Diner, we can establish a new national park, and we can save Pawnee forever."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,She's fading.
Leslie Knope,But Roz is going to stay here with you.
Leslie Knope,Mommy and Daddy have to pack because we're going to a hotel.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, monsters."
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,You jerk! We did it! You jerk.
Leslie Knope,You sat on that news and let me stew here for three hours?
Leslie Knope,You jerk.
Leslie Knope,What makes you so confident?
Leslie Knope,"But what if it doesn't? What if we did all that research and handed Gryzzl a fully-formed plan to revitalize an entire neighborhood and build a new national park, and their board still says no?"
Leslie Knope,It might not work.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's been a week."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Start by cleaning up one part of Pawnee, and preserving the other."
Leslie Knope,Show people that you're invested in this town.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, we are glad that you picked Pawnee, but if you're gonna set up shop here, you need to make a covenant with the city."
Leslie Knope,I can't say these wordsâ¦
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I can't."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,And you could get some baller tax breaks that could help you with that mad stank construction cost.
Leslie Knope,That would be pretty dope.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you donate that land to the National Park Service?
Leslie Knope,Here's a far-out idea that just came to the top of my brainium.
Leslie Knope,"Whereas here at Beachview Terrace, you can take over five entire square blocks of historic Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we just wanted to introduce you to the new home of the Gryzzl campus."
Leslie Knope,Where'd you come from?
Leslie Knope,Who's in?
Leslie Knope,That's why I don't eat Minute Rice.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Would you mind signing a copy of your book?
Leslie Knope,We really appreciate your support.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Senator Gillibrand."
Leslie Knope,Can we come?
Leslie Knope,Starts in 15 minutes.
Leslie Knope,"How about you and me, April, Randy, ""Historical Lampposts of D.C."" walking tour?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have another great idea."
Leslie Knope,I don't think this chance is going to come around again.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think it's the only move, Senator Boxer."
Leslie Knope,Trust me.
Leslie Knope,It's just April.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"April, when Randy brings up the river project, that is your cue toâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Copy that.
Leslie Knope,Group One is boarding.
Leslie Knope,April!
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I did."
Leslie Knope,I didn't really make the shirts.
Leslie Knope,"Just a little fun I was having, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Gov Buds for Life?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, with this, you don't have to worry."
Leslie Knope,"I had to make some guesses about your ultimate government objectives and your fashion choices, etcetera."
Leslie Knope,"Cool, right?"
Leslie Knope,It starts here today with this flight and it goes all the way to 2022.
Leslie Knope,"This is your clear, definitive path through the federal government."
Leslie Knope,I took the liberty of writing the inscription.
Leslie Knope,So Tada!
Leslie Knope,All you have to do is sign.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me a second.
Leslie Knope,A freaking confirmation hearing?
Leslie Knope,A confirmation hearing?
Leslie Knope,"Um, it's a dream come true."
Leslie Knope,Forty four weeks of intensive courses and notetaking?
Leslie Knope,I have to enroll in SESCDP?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I feel bad about what I said before.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,What a wuss.
Leslie Knope,"Couldn't handle the pressure, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Old Norbs is stepping down.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Not a bad start.
Leslie Knope,"So, five yeses and four noes."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I do get it.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to say I'm very surprised that the two of you are seeing eye to eye on this one."
Leslie Knope,"Now, let's talk about National Parks."
Leslie Knope,Every month of my life since fourth grade.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you Actually, I checked with your staff, and they said that you have a free half hour."
Leslie Knope,Do you have a minute to chat?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Senator."
Leslie Knope,And there's room for a P.S. If you feel there's more you left out.
Leslie Knope,He's talkin' about me.
Leslie Knope,It's unstructured chat time.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I think they should all be bigger."
Leslie Knope,"I told you, I'm neutral."
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And anything you want to take from our house.
Leslie Knope,"Also, we want to give you a raise."
Leslie Knope,"Tell the kids not to worry, they're coming back home."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have the zebras."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Roz."
Leslie Knope,What a complicated tapestry that is.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,But you're going to be very soon.
Leslie Knope,Look at how beautiful you look.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"No, we weren't--"
Leslie Knope,"Honey, you were a lot more lucid than I was."
Leslie Knope,"Jenny, I got your number-- Hey, babe, it's ringing!"
Leslie Knope,8675309
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jen."
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,Bad.
Leslie Knope,I also called 867-5309 100 times.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we did."
Leslie Knope,"Today, you're going to pretend like you're not going to run."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so... Yesterday, you pretended you were going to run."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, mine's filled with concrete."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"I was going to surprise you with this in Washington, but what the heck."
Leslie Knope,I think you should run.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I just read an article on two minute micro-naps and the science on them is very promising."
Leslie Knope,It's hard at your age to figure out your path.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I figured."
Leslie Knope,You want to talk about your future?
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could talk about your future.
Leslie Knope,What do you want to talk about?
Leslie Knope,"Carryon bags packed, trashy magazines purchased, boarding passes in hand, and we have 26 minutes for unstructured chat time."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I appreciate your initiative, but itineraries are not the right place to mess around."
Leslie Knope,Don't mess with that.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,It's all on one page.
Leslie Knope,It's readable and compact.
Leslie Knope,Those-- those fonts are perfect.
Leslie Knope,On what grounds?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,We're a great team.
Leslie Knope,Good looking out.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I do?
Leslie Knope,"April, are you super psyched?"
Leslie Knope,How psyched are you about this trip?
Leslie Knope,"I know you're kidding, but I also know that you're prepared, and we are going to do great."
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,"So, the central question that these senators are going to be asking is why should we invest in the National Park Service?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"My God, babe, that was so hot."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, our lives are bonkers but if something is worth it, and I think this is, then you just make it work."
Leslie Knope,"So this whole ""build a playground in a day"" thing, I mean, that's just a slogan, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Keef, that is so incredible."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I work in Parks, and I know how hard it is to get something done."
Leslie Knope,You knew the risks.
Leslie Knope,"It's the movie business, Ted."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, that was amazing!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my gosh."
Leslie Knope,And cut.
Leslie Knope,Just get the right Go under the--
Leslie Knope,Pan left.
Leslie Knope,Rack focus.
Leslie Knope,Action!
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Stunt double.
Leslie Knope,Freeze.
Leslie Knope,Zut alors!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,We have the most rare diamonds in the world.
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see some gorgeous jewelry?
Leslie Knope,'Allo.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I committed to the role!"
Leslie Knope,"She's married to a French billionaire, and she has a twin sister, identical, and they keep--"
Leslie Knope,I came up with a backstory for my character.
Leslie Knope,"'Allo, would you like to see some rings, Agent Haverford?"
Leslie Knope,Action.
Leslie Knope,Quiet on the set!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Ted, are we rolling?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, there's your mark, you'll enter from the front."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody in the van."
Leslie Knope,"My credit card company called me about it, not to question the charges, but to sincerely ask me if I was mentally stable."
Leslie Knope,We're headed to the next location.
Leslie Knope,I'm cool.
Leslie Knope,There's still a very big celebration awaiting you and your fiancee.
Leslie Knope,It was perfect and beautiful.
Leslie Knope,You were right to change course.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Why are you like this?
Leslie Knope,That was so sweet.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Don't follow me!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I already picked a place."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course!"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Good luck.
Leslie Knope,I will leave.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,There are hundreds of people waiting for us.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, what are we doing?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,But you seem like James Bond right now.
Leslie Knope,"I have no idea what's happening, and I'm very scared that everything is falling apart."
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,"Is it because I said, ""It's pizza time""?"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's pizza time.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I'm a cool dudette.
Leslie Knope,I'm cool?
Leslie Knope,"Catch you on the flipside, Tom-egranate Juice."
Leslie Knope,I have ordered banners for every personal and professional event that I've ever organized.
Leslie Knope,"I need a gigantic banner that says ""Congratulations, Lucy and Tom,"" and I need it by tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,Oohlala.
Leslie Knope,What did you get me?
Leslie Knope,You did.
Leslie Knope,But someone here will.
Leslie Knope,I'm realizing I know nothing about the logistics of how to start an underground dance competition.
Leslie Knope,An underground dance competition.
Leslie Knope,And I have just the thing.
Leslie Knope,We need something to begin.
Leslie Knope,"Too many endings, not enough beginnings."
Leslie Knope,"People are dying, moving, retiring."
Leslie Knope,Thanks a lot.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you jinxed us, Garry."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're probably due for some good news."
Leslie Knope,"That's three, Garry."
Leslie Knope,That's three!
Leslie Knope,"We're leaving, April and Andy are leaving, Donna's leaving."
Leslie Knope,"Bad news comes in threes, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, look at it this way."
Leslie Knope,Everyone's scattering.
Leslie Knope,Cheers.
Leslie Knope,Because we're gonna be splitting our time.
Leslie Knope,We need to find a place in D.C.
Leslie Knope,"So, my promotion is official."
Leslie Knope,It's a big deal.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone just officially enrolled in the Senior Executive Service Development Candidate Program at the Department of the Interior."
Leslie Knope,"Andy Dwyer's final goodbye, when we come back."
Leslie Knope,Men's Ferragamo loafers.
Leslie Knope,"Over the past 15 years, I have spent nearly a hundred thousand dollars at your banner store."
Leslie Knope,What am I supposed to do with these?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, lan."
Leslie Knope,I really don't.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Listen, if you can't train 200 white doves in the next four hours to spell out ""Lucy, will you marry me?"", then you have no business calling yourself a pet store."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, um People grieve in different ways."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,Tom Haverford
Leslie Knope,What do you wanna do?
Leslie Knope,And I will help you with the proposal.
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,"46 years later, they're gone."
Leslie Knope,"Because if you wait, before you know it Boom!"
Leslie Knope,You can't wait to tell someone how you feel.
Leslie Knope,Listen to her message.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Listen to Ethel.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,What is happening?
Leslie Knope,They worked together for a long time.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so sad.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you'd probably want her here for that, right?"
Leslie Knope,What better place to ask a woman to marry you than an old man's public memorial?
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Right now.
Leslie Knope,You should propose to her.
Leslie Knope,"What with everything ending, you guys are the happy beginning that we all need."
Leslie Knope,This is perfect.
Leslie Knope,How was your trip?
Leslie Knope,Forever.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, babe."
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so many great conversations, bonding and mentoring moments."
Leslie Knope,"How many times did you and I deliver a form to maintenance, just like this?"
Leslie Knope,"Not you, Kyle."
Leslie Knope,And I know just the person who should accompany me.
Leslie Knope,"I know just where to take it, Ethel."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to the team, little guy."
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Leslie Knope,What's his name?
Leslie Knope,We can talk about it later.
Leslie Knope,"I'm assuming it's my godchild, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I want to scream, but I don't want to wake up my godchild."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,But I do like your team.
Leslie Knope,I really don't.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if you should have kids.
Leslie Knope,"You have kids because you and Andy are a team, and you want to bring in some new team members."
Leslie Knope,Nobody's lives are perfect.
Leslie Knope,It's not about trying to make your life perfect.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,Sandra Dee plus Sandra Day O'Connor?
Leslie Knope,Get it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm Sandra Dee O'Connor."
Leslie Knope,Always nice to see Janet Snakehole and Burt Macklin in the mix.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"And whatever happens, just know that Ben and I are always there for you."
Leslie Knope,It seems only right that we make this journey one final time.
Leslie Knope,I just want to say that we are about to embark on an amazing adventure.
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,Are you enjoying yourself?
Leslie Knope,I am so happy that you get to be mayor.
Leslie Knope,You really saved our butts.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mayor Gergich."
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,Smash that door and do some looting?
Leslie Knope,Have a rally?
Leslie Knope,Hold a public forum?
Leslie Knope,"So, how are we going to fix this swing?"
Leslie Knope,"""Best wishes."""
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to take that.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the book is called Failure."
Leslie Knope,"A bestselling book, a 40 city tour."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this is incredible."
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I am so very proud of you.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and well-dressed."
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, Tom, you have accomplished so much, you have come so far, now you're so successful"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man, I forgot that maintenance was closed on Fridays."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,So Tom and I have a swing to fix.
Leslie Knope,"Although I truly hope that I never see you again, I do wish you a long and happy life."
Leslie Knope,Jean-Ralphio.
Leslie Knope,You're not injured?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is our last day in Pawnee and we have one last problem to fix."
Leslie Knope,Tom got engaged.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Andy, all of those things, including me, will still be with you in Washington."
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.
Leslie Knope,"Because when we used to work here, helping people was our job."
Leslie Knope,"We can, and we will."
Leslie Knope,"Actually, sir, we can help."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Who knows when we'll all be together like this again?
Leslie Knope,This is our last day here.
Leslie Knope,"No, April, Ron, we need to celebrate everything that we've done together as a group."
Leslie Knope,And it goes a little something like this.
Leslie Knope,Garry and I wrote a little musical number about that.
Leslie Knope,The debate about getting a pod-based coffee machine.
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I planned a comprehensive retrospective, but I guess I can just focus on the really important moments."
Leslie Knope,"The Circle Park renovation was complete, and a young man named Thomas Haverford was still two years away from getting hired."
Leslie Knope,Which brings us to 2005.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the new mayor of the great city of Pawnee, Indiana, Garry Gergich!"
Leslie Knope,But we are about to begin a new chapter in Pawnee's history.
Leslie Knope,The passing of our beloved Mayor Gunderson marks the end of an era.
Leslie Knope,"Happy Inauguration Day, buddy."
Leslie Knope,"If you didn't wanna be on call 24/7 for emergencies, then you should not have gone into the high-stakes world of banner making!"
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,"I need a new one, and I need it in 20 minutes."
Leslie Knope,"Now, throw it out."
Leslie Knope,It's great.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ian, thank you so much."
Leslie Knope,You know what? I just had an amazing idea.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad we're leaving.
Leslie Knope,Forget about these old stories.
Leslie Knope,"We need this filed, please."
Leslie Knope,Let's make a new one.
Leslie Knope,One last ride for the Parks and Rec gang.
Leslie Knope,I heard.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We're just taking the elevator.
Leslie Knope,Would anyone like to accompany me to the fourth floor?
Leslie Knope,"April and Andy, I need to file this."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,And I'm so glad that we are leaving the Parks Department in your hands.
Leslie Knope,But I just think you've come so far.
Leslie Knope,"""That person is psychotic, and I need to call the police."""
Leslie Knope,"And then I thought, ""Oh, no, he's insane."""
Leslie Knope,"And then I thought, ""Oh, wow, he's intense."""
Leslie Knope,"You know, Craig, when I first met you, I thought, ""There is a man who loves his job."""
Leslie Knope,We are on one last mission to help the people of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Well, whatever happens, I know that you are going to live an exciting and full life."
Leslie Knope,When do you leave for Seattle?
Leslie Knope,That crazy story about you getting kicked out of En Vogue.
Leslie Knope,"Your confidence, your joie de vivre."
Leslie Knope,"God, I'm going to miss you."
Leslie Knope,You came through like you always do.
Leslie Knope,I knew those scrapbooks were going to come in handy.
Leslie Knope,Five points for Hufflepuff.
Leslie Knope,Correct!
Leslie Knope,Does anyone remember?
Leslie Knope,"So, what is our first step on our quest to help this man?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Who's in?
Leslie Knope,Let's fix the swing.
Leslie Knope,"And this man, right here, built that diner from the ground up, with his own two hands."
Leslie Knope,And the spirit will stay with us.
Leslie Knope,"Well, not here, here, because this studio actually has a show where divorced couples work out their problems, so that might be weird if that thing was hanging over them."
Leslie Knope,"First, speech."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I didn't wanna tell him my real name, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud of us.
Leslie Knope,Do you feel giddy?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann, this is so cool."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Kick, Ass."
Leslie Knope,Check it out.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I had these hard hats made."
Leslie Knope,We're giving ourselves permission.
Leslie Knope,And we're doing it without permission.
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited we're doing this.
Leslie Knope,I wish I knew about that during prom.
Leslie Knope,I've never rented a guy before.
Leslie Knope,"All I did was order a backhoe, and it came with a guy who runs it."
Leslie Knope,Nobody stamped anything.
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a single permit.
Leslie Knope,It was crazy.
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna murder anyone.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You'll help me?
Leslie Knope,What should I do?
Leslie Knope,"Say you had a friend who wanted to do something good, but a little risky, and she was kind of nervous about it, and this friend is me."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Is it Ron?
Leslie Knope,Is important moment here.
Leslie Knope,So who gives me the go ahead to not ask for permission but ask for forgiveness?
Leslie Knope,"We are about to fill this hole now, not with dirt, but with the courage of a thousand lions and the solemn memory of all of our friends who have fallen in this cursed hole."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I have to apologize.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,"All I'm gonna do is go in and just say, ""We are so sorry, it's entirely our fault"""
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can relax."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Lawsuits, and laws and legalese?"
Leslie Knope,Is that all you lawyers think about?
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that you were friends with Andy.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Scott."
Leslie Knope,Then all their babies would live.
Leslie Knope,Maybe birds.
Leslie Knope,Who wants to live in that kind of world?
Leslie Knope,No omelets at all?
Leslie Knope,What's the alternative?
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes when you make an omelet, you got to break a few eggs."
Leslie Knope,It's awful what happened to Andy.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."
Leslie Knope,I'm high on kaboom.
Leslie Knope,Just asking if I can.
Leslie Knope,Can I smoke in here?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,And a little negligent?
Leslie Knope,I got bold?
Leslie Knope,What's my crime?
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry about Andy, but I'm not sorry about what I did."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Dump it!
Leslie Knope,Andy was a victim--
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wow."
Leslie Knope,I won't murder.
Leslie Knope,How do we speed up the process?
Leslie Knope,And this is clean.
Leslie Knope,Let's all pretend Jerry wasn't born.
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"This is gonna open very big, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,This is a big--
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, did you use permanent marker again?"
Leslie Knope,This is a kaboomer.
Leslie Knope,You know what this is?
Leslie Knope,This is a list of things we have to complete before we fill in the pit behind Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,You know what this mess is?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"A slower, more deliberate kaboom."
Leslie Knope,It's just a slow boom.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we are."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Feel I could take on the world.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so pumped."
Leslie Knope,"No, I wish, but back to the real world."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,You have been officially kaboomed.
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but just think of all the kids that'll swing on this swing: fat kids, skinny kids, brainiacs, sluts, the gay drama kids, goths, jocks, the alternative crowd."
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,How do we kaboom it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like that."
Leslie Knope,"Rules, codes, permits, red tape."
Leslie Knope,"In my next life, I'm going into private industry."
Leslie Knope,"Something more plausible than that, but fast."
Leslie Knope,Or a slug driving a remote controlled car.
Leslie Knope,I want to move like a cheetah.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, I am so sick of moving like a slug."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Good job, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Mark's gonna help me, so thanks for nothing, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I want to kaboom it.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, buddy, you're not listening to me."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,This idea better be good.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,These suggestions aren't gonna suggest themselves.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody else needs to participate."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Ideas?
Leslie Knope,How do we cut through the red tape and how do we get this pit filled in?
Leslie Knope,"Focus, please."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Then take out your doing caps, 'cause we're gonna do something today."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody take out their thinking caps and rip them up."
Leslie Knope,Maybe strip mining.
Leslie Knope,I never realized how frustrating it is to be in the government.
Leslie Knope,But it'll be somewhere.
Leslie Knope,Of an extremely unfortunate situation.
Leslie Knope,Can I give him the pig?
Leslie Knope,"When I first met the man standing next to me, he was not a cultural phenomenon."
Leslie Knope,Welcome back.
Leslie Knope,"Andy Dwyer/ Johnny Karate, this is your life!"
Leslie Knope,"Isn't that right, April?"
Leslie Knope,I am going to be taking over hosting my friend's TV show.
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy to be here on your last show ever.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Johnny Karate!"
Leslie Knope,What? Are you sure?
Leslie Knope,I hope they can work us in.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, yes, I'd like the number for Kaboom, the national playground building charity."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna call Kaboom, and check on their availability for next year."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, we're so close."
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Leslie Knope,I wish there was something physical that could make me feel this way.
Leslie Knope,Just waves of pleasure.
Leslie Knope,"My muscles are relaxed, yet I feel awake."
Leslie Knope,I feel flushed.
Leslie Knope,Tingling sensation throughout my whole body.
Leslie Knope,How does taking risks make me feel? Amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, lot."
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, pit."
Leslie Knope,Who knows? Who knows why that gopher does what he does?
Leslie Knope,"Gave up 100,000 dollars probably just for one thing, the city fill in the pit behind your house."
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Just one of his conditions for the settlement, I guess."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Usually, in these situations, a person says ""pinch me."""
Leslie Knope,He was going through a tough time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,He had just broken both legs from falling into a pit.
Leslie Knope,Kid's show.
Leslie Knope,That karate gi will stay here forever.
Leslie Knope,Raise it up!
Leslie Knope,He has brought so much happiness to so many children in southern Indiana that we thought a piece of Johnny Karate should stay here in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"And now it's time to celebrate Andy Dwyer's greatest creation, Johnny Karate."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"So, grab your clue and head on over to Professor Smartbrain."
Leslie Knope,You should be able to solve the case of the missing guitar.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, now that you are an official police officer--"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Take a look.
Leslie Knope,"But you did create Burt Macklin, a character who exemplifies everything that is great about law enforcement."
Leslie Knope,"No, you did not achieve your dream of becoming a Pawnee police officer."
Leslie Knope,Andy faced one of those moments just a few years ago.
Leslie Knope,"Every hero struggles with failure, faces something they cannot do."
Leslie Knope,A salute to Johnny Karate when we come back!
Leslie Knope,But his greatest creation was yet to come.
Leslie Knope,Sir Andy Dwyer had become so many things to so many people.
Leslie Knope,"Friend, coworker, musician, husband Andy Dwyer--"
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Leslie Knope,"It was there that he befriended the 14th Earl of Cornwall upon Thames, Sir Edgar Covington."
Leslie Knope,"From then, Andy went to England for a few months to work for a nonprofit."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,"To commemorate that time and to make sure that you never miss another appointment again, we have brought you a monogrammed day planner."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hi."
Leslie Knope,Andy pulled his life together and he got himself a job at the shoeshine stand in City Hall.
Leslie Knope,"So, in a weird way, Andy, I owe it all to you."
Leslie Knope,"That event set in motion many wonderful things in my life, including the building of the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,"It's a kid's show, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"I can't say the word ""situation""?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say it, but it really seems like Andy has us over a barrel here, Scott."
Leslie Knope,"I think that Andy seems like he doesn't care so much about the second one, and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit."
Leslie Knope,Just call me back.
Leslie Knope,Or call me back.
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna meet, just put a white chalk ""X"" on the mailbox across the street from City Hall."
Leslie Knope,Without lawyers present.
Leslie Knope,I think we should talk.
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said it's your only option?
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Leslie Knope,This is terrible.
Leslie Knope,"Look, can we just talk about this?"
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you're suing your hometown?"
Leslie Knope,"Andy, no."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,The government--
Leslie Knope,We're both here now.
Leslie Knope,You were in a place.
Leslie Knope,Uh... you were in the pit.
Leslie Knope,"Filled with emotions, as any person would."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I just wanted to say, I am so, so"
Leslie Knope,This is my friend Scott.
Leslie Knope,Hope you squeal better.
Leslie Knope,I got this for you.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why aren't you returning my calls?"
Leslie Knope,"What do you say, Scott?"
Leslie Knope,Is it because of your lawyer?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy, it's your aunt, your mom or dad's sister."
Leslie Knope,We planned this.
Leslie Knope,I will not negotiate with greedy street people.
Leslie Knope,Never.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's really terrific."
Leslie Knope,"I know I just said that maybe shortcuts are bad, but I kind of just thought of an awesome shortcut."
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, I tried to fill in the pit, that didn't work either."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes, I think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts."
Leslie Knope,That doesn't sound like Ann.
Leslie Knope,I just can't believe that you're suing just for the money.
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said this was your only option?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann. Just--"
Leslie Knope,Where are you--
Leslie Knope,Has he showed up naked before?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Thank you so--
Leslie Knope,"I feel like if I could get past the lawyers and find out what's really going on, I think I could get him to drop the lawsuit."
Leslie Knope,I promise that Andy isn't suing just for the money.
Leslie Knope,How long have you been there?
Leslie Knope,"Because of a local disaster, you, Andy Dwyer, must go to the evacuation center at Pawnee City Hall."
Leslie Knope,Everybody run!
Leslie Knope,Free guitars at City Hall!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,So we're having a memorial in 30 minutes at City Hall.
Leslie Knope,He's with Jesus now.
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to tell you this but your uncle has passed.
Leslie Knope,It's because of your lawyer.
Leslie Knope,The Committee to Humiliate and Shame America?
Leslie Knope,We're here today because JJ's Diner has been a part of Pawnee for 41 years.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll keep practicing."
Leslie Knope,Who's your girlfriend?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"So, I am here to talk to you about why you should vote ""No"" in the zoning issue."
Leslie Knope,"Sadly, the deciding vote is from my old city council mate, and human equivalent of gas station sushi, Jeremy Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"If I win, stupid Gryzzl and stupid Ron can't build anything there, and then I'm sitting pretty."
Leslie Knope,The city council is voting on whether to rezone the Newport land for commercial use.
Leslie Knope,I truly thought that I would never have to interact with you again.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,War!
Leslie Knope,Hey! Andy! Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"And also I made cookies, but Ron is not allowed to eat them and they say, ""Prepare for War"" on them, but the O in the word ""for"" is a heart."
Leslie Knope,"And also, prepare for war because you chose the wrong side and we are gonna smoke you."
Leslie Knope,Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"So, it's really good to see you both."
Leslie Knope,"Except Donna, Tom, hey."
Leslie Knope,And that's all I wanted to say.
Leslie Knope,You guys are going down.
Leslie Knope,Attention! This is war.
Leslie Knope,I think he nailed it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't."
Leslie Knope,"""This is where it ends."""
Leslie Knope,"In the words of Jason Bourne, ""This is where it started for me."""
Leslie Knope,"And now I have the chance to give this town a massive, beautiful gift that they can use forever."
Leslie Knope,I started my career in Pawnee by turning a pit into a cool little park.
Leslie Knope,All I have to do is convince them that it's better taking no money than taking 90 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,I'm in the game.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry I haven't kept in better touch with you recently, but, you know, I've been a little preoccupied with my kids and my job."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Jamm and Tammy!
Leslie Knope,"""Jammy."""
Leslie Knope,"If I don't get Jamm out from Tammy's clutches, I'm doomed."
Leslie Knope,The vote is tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,So you thought if you voted for Ron you could actually win him back?
Leslie Knope,You guys were supposed to vote for me.
Leslie Knope,The snooker has become the snorked!
Leslie Knope,And I know this because earlier I sneaked and snooked around and Jammy was supposed to vote for me!
Leslie Knope,"No, you got all sneaky and snuck around and snooked that vote away from me."
Leslie Knope,What did you do?
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,What the hell just happened?
Leslie Knope,Please don't say Hitler.
Leslie Knope,I didn't even get a chance to say my plan.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"In my experience with butt faces, you are one."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"And you can trust my opinion because I have a lot to gain by being right, and I have severe tunnel vision about achieving my goals."
Leslie Knope,It's worth it.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'm aligning myself with terrible people, but think of all the wonderful people who will benefit from a national park."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Vote for me so that you can screw Ron over.
Leslie Knope,And you live to torture Ron.
Leslie Knope,Because Ron is my opponent in this.
Leslie Knope,This is great news.
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.
Leslie Knope,"Dear God, why?"
Leslie Knope,"When did you-- Why would either one of you, you know-- Why?"
Leslie Knope,You guys are so cute.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Give me a chance to prove to you how great this could be.
Leslie Knope,Just keep me in the running.
Leslie Knope,"If you donate this land, and you let me turn it into a national park, the Newport National Park, your name will stand for something good for generations to come."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't you shove them all in your dumb mouth and then when I turn around, you can stab me in the back with the skewer?"
Leslie Knope,"First you try to steal my park, and now you steal my team?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how could you?"
Leslie Knope,"There's three of them, it's insane, but they're great."
Leslie Knope,"You know, they're trying to destroy us."
Leslie Knope,They're great.
Leslie Knope,"It's very beautiful, and I'm furious at you."
Leslie Knope,How could you?
Leslie Knope,And you didn't tell me earlier.
Leslie Knope,That's amazing!
Leslie Knope,You're getting married?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm waiting for your hand.
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom's dead to me."
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,"So, hands in, ""Defeat Ron"" on three!"
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know all of you are off doing your own things, and we don't see each other as much as we used to, but I need my old team back for one last mission."
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,What if I buy some of your disappointing son's bolo ties?
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,"So, are you in?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, when you put it like that, I see the irony."
Leslie Knope,The government would keep the land.
Leslie Knope,"No, it would be a donation."
Leslie Knope,What do you say you put some of that casino money to good use?
Leslie Knope,88 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,Why are you even here?
Leslie Knope,It's like rescuing a bunny from a lion.
Leslie Knope,What have you ever done for this city?
Leslie Knope,No one should ever say that word out loud.
Leslie Knope,What do you want the Newport name to mean in the future?
Leslie Knope,My question is this.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, admittedly, it did make the fish taste delicious, but it was a PR nightmare."
Leslie Knope,"And not always in a good way, like when your hot fudge pipeline exploded."
Leslie Knope,The Newport family is part of the fabric of this town.
Leslie Knope,"Through feast and famine, transformation, upheaval, celebration."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is celebrating its 200th anniversary, and the Newport family has been here since day one."
Leslie Knope,I bid zero dollars.
Leslie Knope,It's a zero.
Leslie Knope,But this is the only one that matters.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, Mr. Nelson, you are going to hear a lot of bids today."
Leslie Knope,I just want you to know that I am not sorry that I pushed you into a giant cake.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Who doesn't bake a backup cake?
Leslie Knope,Just wheel out the backup cake.
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Leslie Knope,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,Stop!
Leslie Knope,I want it!
Leslie Knope,"You steal my team, I steal your candle!"
Leslie Knope,Gimme this candle.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,This candle's mine!
Leslie Knope,Give me that candle!
Leslie Knope,You don't deserve that candle!
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"It's like ""Voldemort"" or ""Ron."""
Leslie Knope,I told you to never say that word to me!
Leslie Knope,But that lion is a demonic sociopath with really nice cleavage.
Leslie Knope,So this is where you wanna eat lunch?
Leslie Knope,In a steakhouse?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,"I'll sign the documents here, and then you can bring it to Ron and he can sign it there, and then you can tell Ron to rot in hell."
Leslie Knope,It all works out.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"""I'm not supposed to do this, but let me give you a badge and a siren for your car."""
Leslie Knope,"""Thank you, Leslie, that's the fifth crime you've solved this month."""
Leslie Knope,"""Ronald Swanson."""
Leslie Knope,"""That's him, officer!"""
Leslie Knope,There's no way that I will be in the same room with Ron Swanson unless it is during a police lineup when I am pointing him out as the man who betrayed me.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,But no.
Leslie Knope,You know it turns me on.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I love it when you talk Point of Sale docs."
Leslie Knope,How did you get in here?
Leslie Knope,That doesn't seem like an immediate crisis.
Leslie Knope,Two hundred thousand years from now?
Leslie Knope,Two hundred and three thousand and sixty?
Leslie Knope,"So, hold onto your straws, everybody, because Mama's going grasping."
Leslie Knope,Anything.
Leslie Knope,"Religious reasons, animal conservation, historical significance."
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for anything to strengthen my case that the Newport land should become a park and not a corporate campus.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"So, gentlemen, you have evidence that the Newport land should be preserved."
Leslie Knope,"Back to work, to figure out how to destroy you."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You didn't have to do that.
Leslie Knope,And infinity plus one year.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought it was very big of you to help him at all."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, bring in the next person."
Leslie Knope,We claim William Henry Harrison as a hero because he was the first governor of the Indiana territories and then President of the United States.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Quantity!
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people!"
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to throw a bunch of Harrison facts at them and a big pile of bricks and whatever else we can find."
Leslie Knope,"We are up against a very flashy Internet company, and we should be aiming for quantity over quality."
Leslie Knope,"This is what we have to work with, okay?"
Leslie Knope,People would come from miles just to see it.
Leslie Knope,"And they would sing along with a jug band, and it was just so exciting."
Leslie Knope,"During the election campaign of 1840, William Henry Harrison supporters rolled this ten foot tin and paper ball down country lanes all across America."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, this is so great."
Leslie Knope,Put that down.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,I need to gather everything I can on William Henry Harrison.
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to have to use this old pile of bricks."
Leslie Knope,"We're running out of time, and we need to beat Ron."
Leslie Knope,There's a bag of old hamburgers over there.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, literally."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love William Henry Harrison as much, if not slightly more than, the next guy, but this is garbage."
Leslie Knope,"Here we are, like, ""Here's the place where I buried the map that will show us the way to William Henry Harrison's awesome hunting cabin?"""
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,Show me this incredible lodge.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Which would be icing on the cake, not the reason why we're doing this."
Leslie Knope,"If a US President had a house on that land, it could qualify for historic landmark status, and we could really stick it to Ron's team."
Leslie Knope,But he's our embarrassing footnote.
Leslie Knope,He's an embarrassing footnote.
Leslie Knope,"We're also a little ashamed of him because he didn't wear a coat at his inauguration, caught a bad cold and died 32 days later."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Bill, I remember you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, now that we're chatting, the National Park Service is looking to buy the Newport Land, but we're a little short on funds."
Leslie Knope,This was all for nothing.
Leslie Knope,Do you see what's happening here?
Leslie Knope,Get in here!
Leslie Knope,Jamm!
Leslie Knope,Engage in the culture once in a while!
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,"Uh, have you ever seen Monsters, Inc.?"
Leslie Knope,This is about saving someone's soul.
Leslie Knope,There is a guy in real trouble and you might be the only one who can help him.
Leslie Knope,It's not about the vote.
Leslie Knope,"No, it is not about that."
Leslie Knope,You need to help me break up Jamm and Tammy.
Leslie Knope,I'm calling a temporary truce.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You need to get away from her.
Leslie Knope,She has broken you.
Leslie Knope,You're broken.
Leslie Knope,This is worse than I thought.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Well--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,And you have a Hooters platinum card.
Leslie Knope,You love Porsches and spiked iced tea.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, come on."
Leslie Knope,And you're Jeremy Jamm!
Leslie Knope,I mean it seems like Tammy is trying to turn you into Ron.
Leslie Knope,I don't think this relationship is that healthy.
Leslie Knope,"God, I hate that I know that."
Leslie Knope,Don't you have irritable bowel syndrome?
Leslie Knope,Tammy happened to him!
Leslie Knope,"Without Jamm, the vote's two-two."
Leslie Knope,"Remind you of anyone, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,You keep that in your desk?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Stay strong, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,Nice try.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that wasn't terrible."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"We drilled you on this, Jamm! Baby talk, what do you do?"
Leslie Knope,"""Jamm! Strip down, you sex maggot!"""
Leslie Knope,Let's get gross.
Leslie Knope,"I've got forty hand towels, some energy bars, and a Chinese finger trap."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, ya big hunk of wiener meat."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,"What do you say we get stanky in that pet store bathroom, Jamm?"
Leslie Knope,Time to mount up and ride on into Bonertown.
Leslie Knope,"Hey there, horsey."
Leslie Knope,"I will play Tammy, Ron will play you."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna do some scenes and demonstrate ways that you can resist Tammy.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Twice.
Leslie Knope,Again.
Leslie Knope,Until the bottle is empty.
Leslie Knope,Again.
Leslie Knope,"Ron is holding Tammy's perfume, Girth."
Leslie Knope,We're also gonna try a Pavlovian technique.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,We need to put our issues aside and defend this miserable person!
Leslie Knope,Is that new?
Leslie Knope,Great bolo tie.
Leslie Knope,Ken Hotate!
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't."
Leslie Knope,"But, anyway, I love you."
Leslie Knope,It might be for the best.
Leslie Knope,"I have a lot of questions, but I'm a little amped up right now, so I'll probably just hang up."
Leslie Knope,I want the job.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Grant."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a compelling point."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a gorgeous view."
Leslie Knope,Where are we going?
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna be paralyzed by hypotheticals until I die here, in this minivan at the San Francisco airport."
Leslie Knope,I'm never gonna be able to decide.
Leslie Knope,The only thing that I am 100% positive on is that I want to stay and go.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but I've been doing this for months."
Leslie Knope,I have to turn down the job.
Leslie Knope,I can't leave Pawnee during a difficult merger that I'm responsible for.
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,Don't say it.
Leslie Knope,You lost your cityhood?
Leslie Knope,I have a super system.
Leslie Knope,"I've been accused of lot of things, but cavalier has never been one of them."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,How is that possible?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Is that why you're laughing?
Leslie Knope,I think it was a good presentation too.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,That was weird.
Leslie Knope,By using the Leslie Knope seamless merger supersystem-- patent pending-- Pawnee and Eagleton and their parks departments will be fully integrated within the next 6 to 12 months.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,"No, you know who it--"
Leslie Knope,"Crazy, right?"
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.
Leslie Knope,"This is so touching, you guys."
Leslie Knope,"""'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.' Leslie Knope, multiple occasions."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"""She never abandoned us."""
Leslie Knope,"Leslie Knope, champion of the Pawnee Eagleton merger, ""our most faithful citizen."""
Leslie Knope,And I took the job.
Leslie Knope,"A while ago, I was offered a job at the national parks service, and it's a great opportunity, but it means that I'll have to move to Illinois."
Leslie Knope,That I love and admire you.
Leslie Knope,"Um The reason I wanted you guys to stick around is, I wanted to tell youâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Can the Parks and Rec people hang back for a second?
Leslie Knope,I was picturing bigger hats.
Leslie Knope,The name is too long.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Take it away.
Leslie Knope,This is your show.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you are in charge."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of stuff to do and the meter's still running on that cab, so chop chop."
Leslie Knope,We should go.
Leslie Knope,I panicked.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is Lester Kanopf."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so does that mean that there's two openings left?"
Leslie Knope,Liam Boneville has me in a tizzy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and I met Michelle Obama."
Leslie Knope,I cut out your face and made it look like you were dunking over Charles Barkley.
Leslie Knope,I made a poster of you by blowing up your picture from the national parks newsletter.
Leslie Knope,I've read all of your papers and I had your poster on my wall when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,I know who you are.
Leslie Knope,"Varuvian, yes, hello."
Leslie Knope,"Let me go grab my autograph book, and we'll head out."
Leslie Knope,"Well, now you've got my attention."
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville-- the department of the interior's resident bad boy?
Leslie Knope,I I wouldâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Grant, hi."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, Lester."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, get it together."
Leslie Knope,"""Lester Kanopf""?"
Leslie Knope,"Michelle Obama is the keynote speaker, and you know what they say, ""What happens at a national parks conference... Is compiled and emailed to you in a PDF the following Monday."""
Leslie Knope,It is gonna be so much fun.
Leslie Knope,"I am trying to decide if I should take a job that will move me away from Pawnee, and I am speaking at the National Parks conference in San Francisco."
Leslie Knope,I am pregnant with triplets.
Leslie Knope,I am six days away from the start of the Unity concert.
Leslie Knope,This may be the craziest week of my entire life.
Leslie Knope,Holy cow!
Leslie Knope,"And that, sir, is democracy."
Leslie Knope,Unless that's what the people want.
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna have a fountain shaped like Hugo Chavez's head spitting water all over everyone.
Leslie Knope,"I am gonna build that park myself, and it is gonna be awesome."
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you got to get tough.
Leslie Knope,But diplomacy isn't just sucking up and being a pushover.
Leslie Knope,"No, America is not perfect."
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville read my proposal.
Leslie Knope,I don't know!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,"There's so much more in the world to see, and I feel like I can really make a difference."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna take the job.
Leslie Knope,Anyway I've decided.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna hurt yourself.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Andy, I'm very nervous about this."
Leslie Knope,Just can I high-five you?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
Leslie Knope,Just-- I don't know.
Leslie Knope,My apologies!
Leslie Knope,"I'm getting louder now, and I can't stop!"
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
Leslie Knope,Great work!
Leslie Knope,"That's really, really incredible!"
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,You and Grant work together?
Leslie Knope,"I agree with you on all things throughout history until the end of time, forever."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I do agree with you."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, you are from Chicago, so you like it!"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I would be insane not to take the job, but I'm just having some trouble thinking about leaving Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's fair."
Leslie Knope,"Grant, come on."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I have to see the photos that you took.
Leslie Knope,That was the best lunch I ever had.
Leslie Knope,Rebecca Varuvian.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, let's keep it going."
Leslie Knope,Because I happen to know some of the most dedicated civil servants and greatest people to ever walk the planet earth.
Leslie Knope,Really consider it.
Leslie Knope,I fired you.
Leslie Knope,"Get out of here, Ed!"
Leslie Knope,I have a staff of creative geniuses that will not stop working until we win this bid!
Leslie Knope,"I directly oversee 1,200 people."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you don't know who you're dealing with."
Leslie Knope,This is like Morningstar all over again!
Leslie Knope,Why are you trying to screw me?
Leslie Knope,You know that the National Park System deserves this land.
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe you should!"
Leslie Knope,I have bangs now!
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,You're looking very Ron like.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, former strange person I used to friend."
Leslie Knope,He shouldn't be--
Leslie Knope,He should hide his stupid face.
Leslie Knope,He should run away.
Leslie Knope,He should run.
Leslie Knope,He should hide.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I should hide.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to talk to him.
Leslie Knope,He's here?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Cool.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll go to law school or something.
Leslie Knope,I'm already so bored thinking about that one day off.
Leslie Knope,He's very stupid.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, hi!"
Leslie Knope,"Just between you and me, what do you think your land might sell for tomorrow?"
Leslie Knope,"I have the most valuable currency in America, a blind, stubborn belief that what I am doing is 100% right."
Leslie Knope,Who cares if Gryzzl and Ron have more money?
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let it slip away.
Leslie Knope,That park is my dream.
Leslie Knope,Let's go get that park.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Wave this pen around.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,And that tuxedo makes you look like a sexy orchestra conductor.
Leslie Knope,That is a very smart idea.
Leslie Knope,That's not a coincidence.
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, attendance has been up."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I only have 2 million dollars in the discretionary fund, and I've already used some of it to make Thomas Jefferson sexier in those Mount Rushmore promotions."
Leslie Knope,"You all have 36 hours to find me 90 million dollars, go!"
Leslie Knope,"Dave, put Missouri on the back burner, this is top priority."
Leslie Knope,Call in every favor that we have.
Leslie Knope,Get on the phone to Washington.
Leslie Knope,And that's oddly comforting.
Leslie Knope,You did and said exactly what I thought you were gonna do and say.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you, Jessica."
Leslie Knope,It's a tough one.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no, you haven't though."
Leslie Knope,A National Park?
Leslie Knope,For a very good cause?
Leslie Knope,Would you ever consider giving the federal government a discount?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow!"
Leslie Knope,I'm glad I caught you before you left.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have to ask you something, and I want you to consider it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna work until I'm 100 and then cut back to four days a week.
Leslie Knope,I could retire.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Pawnee is a town on the rise, and national parks could get in on the ground floor."
Leslie Knope,It's right here in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,I think the best version of me working as Midwest regional director is not in Chicago.
Leslie Knope,No time for small talk.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,"I am so furious at you, but I've already forgiven you, and you need to teach me how to play the saxophone."
Leslie Knope,When were you going to tell me about that? Unbelievable!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and by the way, don't think that we are not discussing Duke silver."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I can have everything I want!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's very sweet.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?"
Leslie Knope,"I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here."
Leslie Knope,"Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Everybody turned me down but Larry.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you owe me for that pizza."
Leslie Knope,Life is an adventure.
Leslie Knope,Live on the edge.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, take a risk."
Leslie Knope,"I hope you like deep dish pizza, because there's gonna be a lot more of it in Chicago, where we're all gonna be moving."
Leslie Knope,"You know what, excuse me for wanting my dear friend and ethical mentor to accompany me on the adventure of a lifetime."
Leslie Knope,You'd be working for the federal government.
Leslie Knope,"Hold on, come on, I'm not done."
Leslie Knope,How would you feel about leaving Pawnee and moving to Chicago?
Leslie Knope,"It's the best option, hands down."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wouldn't."
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to make the hardest climb to see the most beautiful sunrise.
Leslie Knope,But it is really how I feel today.
Leslie Knope,This could be my crowning achievement.
Leslie Knope,"This land is begging to be a new national park, and it's in my own backyard!"
Leslie Knope,He's the stupid garbage head doodoo face.
Leslie Knope,I'm perfectly civil.
Leslie Knope,Who's here?
Leslie Knope,How are those scenarios coming?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Whatever they say, we need to come up with 10,000 possible responses to 10,000 possible scenarios."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,But they must've gotten impatient.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there were rumors that they were gonna announce it next month."
Leslie Knope,But that's never stopped us before.
Leslie Knope,Not at all.
Leslie Knope,"One day, in the distant future, things will be calm and normal, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys! Mommy and daddy had to do a little work, and you're gonna have a fun play date with Uncle Andy and Aunty April, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"But honey, tonight's your big night."
Leslie Knope,"Babe, what's our play here?"
Leslie Knope,We'll do it next month.
Leslie Knope,Cancel my flight to South Dakota.
Leslie Knope,You're fired.
Leslie Knope,Clean out your desk.
Leslie Knope,"Ed, you're a nice guy, but you're the most incompetent person I've ever word with, and that includes Terry."
Leslie Knope,Where is Ed with the file? Ed!
Leslie Knope,We are on a media lockdown.
Leslie Knope,"Call Ken and Rebecca, and no statements to the press unless I personally release them."
Leslie Knope,So I'm just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.
Leslie Knope,"I've climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I'm starving, but the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility."
Leslie Knope,I read that once on an old lady's decorative pillow.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab the reading glasses.
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab that walking stick.
Leslie Knope,Your metaphors are so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,I should've been a better friend to you.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I am so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"God, why didn't I see that?"
Leslie Knope,I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you.
Leslie Knope,"You missed your friends, and you wanted to come up to the third floor and work with us again."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you were going--"
Leslie Knope,That's why you wanted to have lunch.
Leslie Knope,You were going to ask me something.
Leslie Knope,Is that the rest of the story? That I stood you up?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I stood you up for lunch."
Leslie Knope,"Oh... Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Can you pick up the kids?
Leslie Knope,I got to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, babe."
Leslie Knope,Meet me at my car.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, get us the first flight out of here and grab the Missouri files."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, really?"
Leslie Knope,"JJ's Diner, 12:30?"
Leslie Knope,It's been too long.
Leslie Knope,I would love to.
Leslie Knope,"So what's up with you, you big lug?"
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, this is a crazy day."
Leslie Knope,"Did you talk to Randy about the vote? Tell the Northeast that we need to put pressure on them, or else we're gonna be waiting forever, and I'm tired of waiting on them, okay? Okay."
Leslie Knope,One second.
Leslie Knope,Do my eyes deceive me? Is that Ron Swanson?
Leslie Knope,"Well, my, my, my."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, there's a way to fix that."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,England's got a new queen Everybody's really mean We didn't start the fire It was always burning Since the world's been turning
Leslie Knope,We're sorry.
Leslie Knope,Gryzzl has billions of dollars.
Leslie Knope,"""It would be so nice."""
Leslie Knope,"Right now, my basic argument is, ""Please give us the land."""
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to get a group of people to give me their land rather than sell it to Gryzzl for 90 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, what do you want from me?"
Leslie Knope,I give up.
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.
Leslie Knope,It's not gonna work in a million years.
Leslie Knope,It's impossible.
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,"People are idiots, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"April, Ron and I are going to JJ's to eat too much breakfast food."
Leslie Knope,I'm starving.
Leslie Knope,"For the first time in my life, I am present-less."
Leslie Knope,I don't have anything for you.
Leslie Knope,But I feel bad.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,"You big, fat, giant sap."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,But you do realize I gave you this picture six hours ago.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is very sweet."
Leslie Knope,I have three years' worth of hugs to force upon you against your will.
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Leslie Knope,"Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"No, whoever it is, I have zero interest in--"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call."
Leslie Knope,Fire and money and people
Leslie Knope,"Morning, guys."
Leslie Knope,There's no way I beat them.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, we needed a mindless factotum, and he's the best there is."
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, okay."
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Mr. Swanson, I'm sorry for raising my voice in the interview, and I'm sorry I called you a heartless thug."""
Leslie Knope,You kept it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the thank you note I wrote to you after the interview."
Leslie Knope,I most certainly did not.
Leslie Knope,And that was it.
Leslie Knope,"""Good day."""
Leslie Knope,"Then you said, ""Everything that just came out of your mouth is basic nonsense."""
Leslie Knope,"""What do you believe the role of government is in America?"""
Leslie Knope,"And you said to me, ""Ms. Knope, I have one question for you."""
Leslie Knope,You were wearing that exact outfit.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I remember that interview."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that doesn't make any sense."
Leslie Knope,Why did you hire me?
Leslie Knope,We should've never worked together.
Leslie Knope,And that's what I don't get.
Leslie Knope,Why did you give me the job?
Leslie Knope,He's gone.
Leslie Knope,"He's gone, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we're trapped in here!"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,It's another person!
Leslie Knope,It's a person.
Leslie Knope,You forgot the last sentence.
Leslie Knope,"""If it matters, I promise I would never ""raise my voice at you if we worked together."""
Leslie Knope,Spill it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I was being really optimistic."
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,What happened to these workplace proximity associates?
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to do but talk.
Leslie Knope,You have tried every possible means of escape.
Leslie Knope,"There's nowhere to run, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I've seen it all.
Leslie Knope,I've seen you without a mustache.
Leslie Knope,I've seen you with your eyebrows blown off.
Leslie Knope,"Stop whining, you big baby."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look great."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You okay?
Leslie Knope,I found some towels.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,So the fire department disconnected it.
Leslie Knope,April kept pulling it.
Leslie Knope,That alarm is just for sprinklers.
Leslie Knope,"God, no!"
Leslie Knope,"No, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,"Two years ago, you found out you were a quarter French and you had a nervous breakdown."
Leslie Knope,Ready?
Leslie Knope,"If I guess and guess right, you have to tell me."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,Let's just talk about our issues.
Leslie Knope,"Let's just bring it home, okay?"
Leslie Knope,We're doing so great.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, look how far we've come."
Leslie Knope,"""Please enjoy these homemade brownies as a gesture of goodwill."""
Leslie Knope,Why don't you read it yourself?
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Is that too much to ask?
Leslie Knope,All I wanted was valued at 100 million dollars given to me for free.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Stop patting my head.
Leslie Knope,Just give me a... We're in sync emotionally.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"And just like Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, we are totally in sync."
Leslie Knope,"Ron and I had a little falling out, but we are back, baby."
Leslie Knope,"Because when you and I team up, great things happen."
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it doesn't, something will."
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,We already have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"For what I hope is the last time, but we'll assume is not the last time, our strategy does not involve blimps."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time in this land battle, they are vulnerable and we are gonna capitalize on it with something big and exciting."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Gryzzl is scrambling."
Leslie Knope,I thought you didn't like to pass judgment on--
Leslie Knope,"You have done so much for this town, and people know that."
Leslie Knope,"This Gryzzl thing, it's complicated, but this isn't Ice Town."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,They're all down.
Leslie Knope,I think there are certain questions about certain aspects of certain parts of this situation that require an evaluation about whether or not this is or is not a valid argument.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Perd--"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, make sure that Donna doesn't hurt him."
Leslie Knope,It's over.
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna take the fall for this.
Leslie Knope,They won.
Leslie Knope,This town is gonna be unrecognizable in 10 years.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well."
Leslie Knope,"Hear, hear."
Leslie Knope,Dynamic duo get together one more time to try to save JJ's Diner?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what do you say?"
Leslie Knope,I think this is a job for Jonathan Karate.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you to get the word out, with whatever method of communication young people are using these days."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take him down with an old fashioned public rally.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,That guy is the worst.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, figures."
Leslie Knope,The cologne guy?
Leslie Knope,That's why we are gonna fight hard to save your diner.
Leslie Knope,"No, nothing is ever wrong here."
Leslie Knope,JJ.
Leslie Knope,"They may have taken that land, but I will be damned if they take my waffles."
Leslie Knope,Enough is enough.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"My milkshake, you guys."
Leslie Knope,One place asked me if I wanted kale in my milkshake.
Leslie Knope,And there's too much kale now.
Leslie Knope,But I think the town is losing some of its charm.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the standard of living is up, we have pressed juice bars, and yoga studios, and a pet hotel."
Leslie Knope,I'm happy with some of the changes that Pawnee has gone through.
Leslie Knope,However many waffles it takes to keep you in business.
Leslie Knope,Even JJ's Diner is disappearing.
Leslie Knope,Everything is changing.
Leslie Knope,"""Open your door?"""
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, talk some sense into him."
Leslie Knope,I think you're gonna really enjoy this month's photo album.
Leslie Knope,February 2016.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, of course."
Leslie Knope,"Actually, this is Tom Selloink, but, you know, close enough."
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,And the next domino to fall?
Leslie Knope,Donna is on our side.
Leslie Knope,The town is behind us.
Leslie Knope,"Finally, after months of searching for a way to defeat Gryzzl, we have found its Achilles' heel."
Leslie Knope,You guys are not against us on this?
Leslie Knope,"So, wait."
Leslie Knope,We are here today to discuss Gryzzl and whether or not they are invading our privacy.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,I don't understand what that means but I think I get the context and I love it!
Leslie Knope,This stuff is perfect for me.
Leslie Knope,A poster of the Supreme Court Justices sipping the Friends milkshake!
Leslie Knope,"Joe Biden's book, Biden the Rails, 1,001 Poems Inspired by My Travels through Amtrak's Northeast Corridor."
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Aww!
Leslie Knope,Planning on sending it back after I wrote a sternly worded letter about how I cannot be bought with free gifts.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, but I haven't opened it yet."
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,We're screwed.
Leslie Knope,I made fun of you when you said it would happen but your novel has come true.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my, The robots have come for us."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're about to die!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"It includes such hits as first trip to the dentist, Sonia tries pizza, and water park vomit chain reaction."
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,Why would you not?
Leslie Knope,"Ron technically works for Gryzzl, and when he finds out what Gryzzl is doing, he is going to lose his mind."
Leslie Knope,This is not your fault.
Leslie Knope,That's how they slipped it in.
Leslie Knope,They knew you'd be distracted.
Leslie Knope,You were muttering that date in your sleep for months.
Leslie Knope,That was the opening day of Episode VII.
Leslie Knope,"December 18th, 2015."
Leslie Knope,Look at the revision date.
Leslie Knope,Public humiliation on live television.
Leslie Knope,The one thing that Americans respect more than anything else.
Leslie Knope,But there's one more thing we need.
Leslie Knope,"We have public opinion on our side, and we have proof that Gryzzl has been datamining."
Leslie Knope,"I think maybe we could debate them, you know, on TV."
Leslie Knope,"These are really interesting issues, Roscoe."
Leslie Knope,"""Wouldn't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other?"""
Leslie Knope,Isn't that your motto?
Leslie Knope,Just 'cause we're competing for the Newport land doesn't mean that we can't be friends.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,How did you know it was me?
Leslie Knope,"Are you guys, I don't know, whatever, datamining?"
Leslie Knope,"So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl know all the things that someone wants?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, what do you do with this information?"
Leslie Knope,We love Gryzzl and we would love to see how it all works.
Leslie Knope,But it feels so right.
Leslie Knope,"Ours is a new romance, but one that sent shockwaves through my architecture firm."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Darlene Johannsen, and this is my assistant turned lover, Gregory Strong."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,So cute-- What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody, listen up."
Leslie Knope,Three lousy lines?
Leslie Knope,The beginning of the whole shebang.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, babe, Game of Thrones is on tonight!"
Leslie Knope,Let us out.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this is insane, okay?"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,What? What's going on? What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's just get this over with."
Leslie Knope,But I get to sign first.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"So, that calmed me down a little."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I ordered 60 veggie pizzas to Ron's office."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"You're the most unreasonable, stubborn person I have ever met, and I'm never gonna change my mind on that, no matter what anybody says!"
Leslie Knope,You've been unreasonable way before Morningstar!
Leslie Knope,You are the unreasonable one!
Leslie Knope,That's not even a word.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand your stupid mustache and your stupid shirt and your stupid name.
Leslie Knope,You know what? I can't stand you.
Leslie Knope,I'm not signing anything he's signing.
Leslie Knope,"No, it was not! We had way more quantity than you."
Leslie Knope,"All flash, and no substance."
Leslie Knope,That was sickening.
Leslie Knope,That's who.
Leslie Knope,Martin Van Buren.
Leslie Knope,It's the series finale.
Leslie Knope,They're talking about this ball.
Leslie Knope,Khaleesi is marrying Jack Sparrow.
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,I bet I can make you talk.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron, why don't we just--"
Leslie Knope,"We can either talk about our issues and work through our problems, or we can just sit here doing nothing."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we are going to be here for 10 hours."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the furniture, the pictures Craig changed everything."
Leslie Knope,Everything's different.
Leslie Knope,I did not consider that possibility!
Leslie Knope,I destroyed the monitor!
Leslie Knope,Hut!
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'll tell them that, for the past three years, you've been a perfect gentleman and scholar, and I am an insane weirdo who, despite being the only reason we even had a friendship to begin with, decided to ruin it, out of the blue, for no good reason."
Leslie Knope,Because we want them to believe us and not laugh really hard at a ridiculous science fiction scenario.
Leslie Knope,"And you admitted that you were a stubborn butthead, and everything's fine now."
Leslie Knope,"I'll just tell them that I apologized for, whatever, heroically caring too much."
Leslie Knope,"We'll just wait a few minutes, turn on this monitor, and then we'll tell Ben that we talked it out and made up."
Leslie Knope,There is another way.
Leslie Knope,You'll slice your arm open.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, there's security wire in there."
Leslie Knope,There's no way around them.
Leslie Knope,They installed these magnetic locks two years ago.
Leslie Knope,I don't think there is.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Terry!"
Leslie Knope,"For once in your life, do something right."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"That's right, buddy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, that show has really gone off the rails."
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,"Hit it, gang!"
Leslie Knope,"Now, travel back in time with me to 1840, when William Henry Harrison, ""Old Tippecanoe,"" runs for President."
Leslie Knope,That's something to chew on.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Because, you know, I've always thought that we shared very similar jawlines."
Leslie Knope,Could that be possible?
Leslie Knope,Do you?
Leslie Knope,You are Indiana's last living link to this great man.
Leslie Knope,It is an honor to have you here.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello, Zach."
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people."
Leslie Knope,"So help me God, I will make a mountain out of this molehill."
Leslie Knope,And we need all of this stuff.
Leslie Knope,And we need him for the press conference.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's American royalty."
Leslie Knope,His veins pulse with the blood of our storied forefathers!
Leslie Knope,American royalty!
Leslie Knope,This is our guy!
Leslie Knope,Does William Henry Harrison have any direct descendants in the area?
Leslie Knope,"Bill, Operation Quantity needs a face."
Leslie Knope,Two can play this game.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,That little rat.
Leslie Knope,"No, you have to tell me because you legally bound yourself to me in marriage, sucker."
Leslie Knope,What's Ron up to?
Leslie Knope,I'm officially dubbing this Operation Quantity.
Leslie Knope,Grab everything you can.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, okay, doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"And his campaign rolls this giant tin and paper ball from town to town, while Americans everywhere sing along."
Leslie Knope,I need this to be very impressive.
Leslie Knope,Just go in there.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sit."
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Leslie Knope,"In the form of his direct descendant, Zachary."
Leslie Knope,Let's ask him.
Leslie Knope,Don't believe me?
Leslie Knope,The point is William Henry Harrison would have wanted this land preserved as a national park.
Leslie Knope,"Did he write letters to Thomas Jefferson on his rolltop desk, which, you know, I don't know, might have existed."
Leslie Knope,Did Harrison plan his presidential campaign while sitting around the hearth which used to be there.
Leslie Knope,What great historical moments took place within these hallowed halls?
Leslie Knope,A heretofore unknown hunting lodge was recently discovered smack dab in the middle of the Newport land.
Leslie Knope,And the National Parks Service is proud to say that we've discovered a new chapter in the life of local hero and President William Henry Harrison.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is a place of culture, history, and heritage."
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,We start in 10 minutes.
Leslie Knope,Ignore them.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You can't do that.
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Walk in.
Leslie Knope,Quiet now.
Leslie Knope,"Just walk, walk, walk there."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"So, head on in there and be presidentially descended."
Leslie Knope,This is all you wrote?
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Is it that I sent you a birthday card through the US mail so the post office knew your address?
Leslie Knope,Progress.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on!"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just talk to me."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please, don't--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, you made a key?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on."
Leslie Knope,What was the reason?
Leslie Knope,Why then?
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,What does that mean?
Leslie Knope,"You spend the next two years cutting down trees and fighting zoning laws that I helped pass, basically spitting on everything we did together at Parks."
Leslie Knope,You tear down Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,"Enjoy your new job, Judas."
Leslie Knope,"You knew that I would be furious, and you didn't have the guts to tell me yourself."
Leslie Knope,That's not the point.
Leslie Knope,"""That's so posh and hibbley fibbley gibbley."""
Leslie Knope,"""We live at the Morningstar."""
Leslie Knope,"""Oh, dear."""
Leslie Knope,"""Morningstar?"""
Leslie Knope,And what's it called?
Leslie Knope,This building is a monstrosity.
Leslie Knope,That's not the point.
Leslie Knope,That is the house where Ann gave me my first ever smoky eye look.
Leslie Knope,That is the house where April and Andy met for the first time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, is it because I had Food and Stuff temporarily shut down due to a health code violation?"
Leslie Knope,That was the house where I put on my wedding dress the night I got married.
Leslie Knope,They had fresh produce out right next to the roach spray.
Leslie Knope,And is that really the reason?
Leslie Knope,"It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron."
Leslie Knope,This application contains your very first impressions of me.
Leslie Knope,I've never read it.
Leslie Knope,But here's the thing.
Leslie Knope,Freedom of Information Act request.
Leslie Knope,This is my job application from when you hired me.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,And this is my best shot.
Leslie Knope,I am going to break it.
Leslie Knope,This is a code.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just reading back through some of our old projects, trying to figure out what happened that made you quit."
Leslie Knope,Good talk.
Leslie Knope,Who gets angry at balloons?
Leslie Knope,It's funny stuff.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You've been doing an explosive job!
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You mean to tell me you've thought you had an actual land mine on your desk?
Leslie Knope,"I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was."
Leslie Knope,I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.
Leslie Knope,Woohoo!
Leslie Knope,"Look, before you do thatâ¦"
Leslie Knope,There's no cursing in the Constitution.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just wait a second."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,As many as I need to to solve this mystery and get us engaged in a deep and stimulating conversation about our friendship.
Leslie Knope,It's called Whole Foods.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,That's my best friend's old house.
Leslie Knope,"Ann lived there, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I don't know the words.
Leslie Knope,And guess what?
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna maintain eye contact the whole time.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna sing along.
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna play Jerry's choice.
Leslie Knope,But I am not going to play your choice.
Leslie Knope,A fact I remember because my mind is a steel trap of friendship nuggets.
Leslie Knope,You chose Buddy by Willie Nelson.
Leslie Knope,I asked everyone in the Parks Department to choose one song.
Leslie Knope,"This is a mix I made for the summer Parks barbecue, 2007."
Leslie Knope,"You know what this is, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,Ah-hah!
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,You want to talk?
Leslie Knope,"Last chance, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"You guys, Ron loves plastic."
Leslie Knope,"I think wood is stupid, and so does everybody else."
Leslie Knope,"One word, and this is over."
Leslie Knope,Drip.
Leslie Knope,Drip.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me!
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,"Harry Truman was a guy America, Red China All the countries, other people Everyone is fun Joe Mantegna, lan McKellen I have to buy a new toaster This is awesome You're so stupid Jumping up and down Whoo!"
Leslie Knope,That's Ann's old house.
Leslie Knope,I got it on repeat.
Leslie Knope,"Do you want to hear it again, or do you want to talk?"
Leslie Knope,And you're gonna tear all the houses down?
Leslie Knope,"This building is gonna ruin the views, you jerk."
Leslie Knope,The park that I built from scratch out of a pit?
Leslie Knope,You're building your stupid building on the block next to Pawnee Commons?
Leslie Knope,"What the hell, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"I hear about Morningstar, and I calmly saunter down to your office and attempt to have a rational discussion with you about it."
Leslie Knope,"And then, two months after that, Morningstar, the final twist of the knife."
Leslie Knope,"""Oh, well,"" I think to myself, ""You know, it was only a matter of time."""
Leslie Knope,"One week later, I return from a trip, and I find out you have quit the Parks Department and you have started your own building company without even bothering to tell me."
Leslie Knope,"Three months later, you come and visit me at my office on the third floor for the very first time."
Leslie Knope,That is the last time you and I see each other for more than five minutes.
Leslie Knope,"At her request, the party's theme is ""Zombie Teenage Biker Gang Pizza Jamboree."""
Leslie Knope,We throw her a party.
Leslie Knope,"Three months later, April comes to work for me."
Leslie Knope,"You and I see each other less, admittedly, due to my busy schedule and your utter lack of interest in maintaining adult friendships."
Leslie Knope,"Three years ago, I accept a job at National Parks."
Leslie Knope,A well organized chart.
Leslie Knope,And I will do so using the most powerful tool known to man.
Leslie Knope,"And once again, it is up to me to save our friendship."
Leslie Knope,And now we're not.
Leslie Knope,We were friends.
Leslie Knope,We were friends for 10 years.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Krueger bought some pants Oprah has a turtle farm Peter Piper peepee poopy Daddy ate a squirrel
Leslie Knope,"Okay, next verse."
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"I have the floor! ""There once was a boy named Milo, who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but"""
Leslie Knope,"So, have you asked him yet about the money?"
Leslie Knope,Leave it up.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You're just realizing that now?
Leslie Knope,Is that me?
Leslie Knope,I couldn't get her number.
Leslie Knope,"I'm putting it out there, like The Secret."
Leslie Knope,"And hopefully, she'll call me."
Leslie Knope,Our first interview is at 93.7 FM with Crazy Ira and The Douche.
Leslie Knope,That's me.
Leslie Knope,They are Pawnee's most hilarious drive time radio guys.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,They're seriously so funny.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please."
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Please give the speech.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, yes"
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to explain it.
Leslie Knope,"Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, ""What can't that centaur woman do?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Besides ride an escalator and drive a car."""
Leslie Knope,That painting is not going to be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,"""34.2%"""
Leslie Knope,Do you find this personally offensive?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, is she serious?"
Leslie Knope,Destroy it?
Leslie Knope,"It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Ben, the numbers robot."
Leslie Knope,Bestiality?
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that's fair.
Leslie Knope,"This isn't about you, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Learn it.
Leslie Knope,"When you're done with the light, fix the printer."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"So, we're doing a huge media blitz to publicize the Harvest Festival, and we've got TV, newspaper, radio. And I even called Oprah."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the painting.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I tried to call Oprah."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow lover of the arts."
Leslie Knope,It's staying right here.
Leslie Knope,"No, this painting isn't going anywhere, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Art can be so magnificent.
Leslie Knope,Please give the speech.
Leslie Knope,Every great work of art contains a message.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"Donna? Every time I want you to shut up, from now on."
Leslie Knope,That's enough.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, whatever."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"N, Tom N. Haverford."
Leslie Knope,How did you and I get matched up?
Leslie Knope,"I'm kidding! All right, be honest, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Did I scare you?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna try to make it work with Tom.
Leslie Knope,It's like door number two on Let's Make a Deal.
Leslie Knope,I prefer to meet people in person.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if the online thing is for me.
Leslie Knope,Sounds good.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,There's also going to be ponies at the Harvest Festival.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,You wanna go somewhere and talk about them?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I never got to tell you the rest of my ideas."
Leslie Knope,"Do you want the thing that you have, that you know you like, but isn't perfect, or do you give it up for what's behind door number two? I think I like what I have."
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to remind you of the art show that's happening tonight at the community center.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Leslie Knope,I thought you had a rule about intergovernment relationships.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Give the speech, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Well, The Douche, it's a Pawnee tradition, and it's where fun meets awesome."
Leslie Knope,Meets agriculture.
Leslie Knope,"And it is going to be next month, right here in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"And spoiler alert, it's going to have the best corn maze ever."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,Make the speech.
Leslie Knope,Do it for me.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,I don't have it in me right now.
Leslie Knope,There's also going to be hay rides.
Leslie Knope,I'm just I'm not in the mood.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, can you make the opening remarks?"
Leslie Knope,A hug?
Leslie Knope,"Weak, flickering, barely giving off any light, unable to make out with the light bulb I want to make out with."
Leslie Knope,I'm like that light bulb.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I feel so
Leslie Knope,"I can't go home, because I have this art show opening at the community center, and I can't stay here because I see Ben, and I can't date Ben because of Chris' stupid rules."
Leslie Knope,"God, this sucks."
Leslie Knope,We weren't You You
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,No clue.
Leslie Knope,"And the message of this painting is, ""Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia."""
Leslie Knope,"Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one."
Leslie Knope,A real goddess.
Leslie Knope,"He said he didn't like her, so it's over."
Leslie Knope,"There were many kinds of Greek goddesses, some were lovers, some were warriors, and some were tricksters."
Leslie Knope,Unless of course they have a problem with centaurs having modern haircuts.
Leslie Knope,But I think you'll find no one could possibly be offended.
Leslie Knope,Feel free to destroy it.
Leslie Knope,I had the artist paint over the original.
Leslie Knope,Let's take a look at it first shall we?
Leslie Knope,Come with me.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Gayle, I know Jerry is your husband."
Leslie Knope,"Say goodbye to Diaphena, I have to turn her over to stupid Marcia Langman."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I should go, hit the road with this and..."
Leslie Knope,You guys are sweet.
Leslie Knope,Does that look like me I don't even
Leslie Knope,No it's on the other side.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I stole a painting, and I was hoping you guys would help me hide it."
Leslie Knope,I'm so annoyed by all these rules lately.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
Leslie Knope,What do I do here?
Leslie Knope,You're a level-headed person.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, if I could just explain to you my point of view."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you later.
Leslie Knope,Look I can promise you there's absolutely nothing going on between us.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I did not pose for that painting, but thank you for thinking I did."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, sure, hold on"
Leslie Knope,"Good day, sir."
Leslie Knope,"There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and--"
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,I have a lot of years to make up for.
Leslie Knope,And it's gonna be really big.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do something.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna do nothing.
Leslie Knope,Was it?
Leslie Knope,"Was it worth it, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you blew it."
Leslie Knope,"Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a well placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday."
Leslie Knope,He's even had it redacted on all government documents.
Leslie Knope,Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is.
Leslie Knope,"Birthday, birthday, birthday It's your birthday It's your birthday, and I know when it is."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing for your birthday on Friday?
Leslie Knope,"No, that's been there since the '90s."
Leslie Knope,Is that new?
Leslie Knope,Nice bench.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What painting?
Leslie Knope,"Perd, it is a beautiful work of art."
Leslie Knope,Hi Chris.
Leslie Knope,It's very classy.
Leslie Knope,"Members of the Public Art Commission, good afternoon and good art."
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,Filled with hippies who love art and sometimes weed.
Leslie Knope,Public Arts Commission.
Leslie Knope,Fine with me.
Leslie Knope,This isn't your fight.
Leslie Knope,"Stand down, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.
Leslie Knope,I am not going to take the role.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did not know that Brandi was going to offer me a role in her next film."
Leslie Knope,Every great society has always supported artistic expression.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, ""I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it."""
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,It was never our intention to offend anyone I guess some people object to powerful depictions of awesome ladies.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,But it does look a little bit like me.
Leslie Knope,"Boy, 35%?"
Leslie Knope,The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.
Leslie Knope,I am not the subject.
Leslie Knope,Pornography is very difficult to define.
Leslie Knope,The Romans.
Leslie Knope,The Greeks.
Leslie Knope,Two great societies in Europe.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to look at it if you don't want to.
Leslie Knope,"Just basically like the chestal region, mostly."
Leslie Knope,And it's a nude.
Leslie Knope,Well it's a painting of me as a centaur.
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?
Leslie Knope,"Really, huh"
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,Where is Andy and April?
Leslie Knope,"I was at a meeting around the corner and some people wanted to destroy this painting, so I brought it here."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi."
Leslie Knope,"Make me stag, I am Diaphena."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,What do you say?
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't need to hang in a government building, just let me take it home and I'll keep it there."
Leslie Knope,Look this painting is very important to me
Leslie Knope,"You've made your point, okay"
Leslie Knope,You're supposed to be in favor of public art.
Leslie Knope,What are you serious?
Leslie Knope,We've decided that the painting should be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's in the bag."
Leslie Knope,What is or isn't art is up to every free thinking American to decide on their own.
Leslie Knope,"There are some members of this community that would like to demonize this painting, and when they do they in fact demonize art itself."
Leslie Knope,"Oh man it's chris, I'm gonna take this."
Leslie Knope,No one likes them.
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,Really? Did he say who?
Leslie Knope,He's dark and mysterious.
Leslie Knope,They're condescending.
Leslie Knope,No opinion.
Leslie Knope,Love.
Leslie Knope,Love.
Leslie Knope,Love.
Leslie Knope,Mural.
Leslie Knope,I'm scared of bees.
Leslie Knope,"Eww, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Just the bench in front of the mural.
Leslie Knope,And he can sing.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,"Upstairs, there is this mural of wildflowers."
Leslie Knope,Jamming on my planner.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, that doesn't sound fun."
Leslie Knope,Organizing my agenda.
Leslie Knope,Much better.
Leslie Knope,Likes waffles and news.
Leslie Knope,Yellow haired female.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,Is that a different guy from earlier?
Leslie Knope,And I like to sit on a bench in front of it.
Leslie Knope,And he plays the organ.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with me?
Leslie Knope,He seems nice.
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, Craig."
Leslie Knope,Your marriage is a sham.
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's not gonna last."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,He's like a little sister to me.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I like him as a friend and everything, but I'd never go out with him."
Leslie Knope,We are colleagues with benefits.
Leslie Knope,Your soul mate match was totally wrong for me.
Leslie Knope,We're colleagues who benefit from the fact that we're also friends.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,I think I need to go.
Leslie Knope,"But, thank you so much, and as always, everything I said is off the record."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Craig, your service is crap."
Leslie Knope,"Entire universe of guys I might date, let's see what you got."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,"[bleep] you, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,Why do good guys hate me and gross guys love me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's not."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"I have first pick, and my pick is Ron."
Leslie Knope,We could have a City Hall dodgeball league!
Leslie Knope,Creepy.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your Mmm.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,Where is this coming from?
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,"Look out, boys."
Leslie Knope,"Mark, I have a letter in my file."
Leslie Knope,You're not supposed to be drinking on government property.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"And there's still something very complicated between us, soâ¦"
Leslie Knope,We had a brief affair in February of 2004.
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I did it for a guy.
Leslie Knope,You know what I mean? And just kind of infiltrate the boys' club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club now.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, let's do it."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,You're a monster.
Leslie Knope,I don't think that's for me.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I was just picturing it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,That really stings.
Leslie Knope,I was-- Crap on a crayfish.
Leslie Knope,And then also kissing?
Leslie Knope,Who was that guy you were talking to out there?
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"And then, he walked into an office that wasn't his."
Leslie Knope,"He was like, ""Huh? What? Uh... Bye."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So, I asked Ben out to dinner and he said no."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's do it."
Leslie Knope,"You know, go to J.J's or something, grab a bite?"
Leslie Knope,Or we could go out after work.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have some ideas for the health initiative."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm not allowed there anymore."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm glad that's over.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Diagnose me.
Leslie Knope,"So, I should go and ask them what they think I'm selling."
Leslie Knope,Whoever takes the most steps wins a prize.
Leslie Knope,We give everyone pedometers and we have a contest.
Leslie Knope,I'll do the newspaper interview.
Leslie Knope,You and Ben do Channel Four.
Leslie Knope,Always good for you.
Leslie Knope,We do stretches at our desk or next to our desk or in a chair.
Leslie Knope,Perd Hapley is a big softie.
Leslie Knope,Office yoga.
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Anything to get their heart rate up.
Leslie Knope,Can you grab them for me?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Tom, I'm just printing out these health tips."
Leslie Knope,Enough.
Leslie Knope,He can do it.
Leslie Knope,"All right, Tom."
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to figure out why only sleazy guys are into me right now.
Leslie Knope,"This is not a date, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Soulmate level match.
Leslie Knope,98% match.
Leslie Knope,"This is insane, but you and I got matched up on hoosiermate.com."
Leslie Knope,Promise not to tell anyone?
Leslie Knope,It'll be a puff piece.
Leslie Knope,Can you excuse us for a second?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you for a second?
Leslie Knope,No hard feelings.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we weren't-- No."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's so cute."
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,"I can assure you, there's nothing romantic going on between me and Tom."
Leslie Knope,It was all just a joke.
Leslie Knope,They should fix that.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,No worries.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it was just a bump in the road."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You should be so lucky.
Leslie Knope,"Fortunately, the Lesliemobile is an all terrain vehicle."
Leslie Knope,"So, everything involving Ben is fine."
Leslie Knope,Knock it off.
Leslie Knope,I just need to talk to you in private about something different that is not Ben related.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, good job."
Leslie Knope,You are being a little bit too much of an ass right now.
Leslie Knope,Hey What is wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,"I know, but we need him."
Leslie Knope,"If they ask us about the budget, he's our numbers guy."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You're a nurse.
Leslie Knope,All you cared about was the shape of their boobs?
Leslie Knope,Lucy?
Leslie Knope,Let's say you rub a bottle and a genie comes out and gives you three wishes.
Leslie Knope,This'll be fun.
Leslie Knope,You can get as many 'zerts as you want.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"There's no story here, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,I'm buying.
Leslie Knope,He's just a dedicated civil servant who is doing whatever he can to make sure that this is the best Harvest Festival ever.
Leslie Knope,"And he's easy on the eyes, too."
Leslie Knope,Your choice.
Leslie Knope,We can go anywhere.
Leslie Knope,What would those wishes be?
Leslie Knope,Do you wanna go to lunch?
Leslie Knope,"So, basically, you're just attracted to me because I'm not an elderly person."
Leslie Knope,"And I was just wondering, what do you look for in a woman?"
Leslie Knope,I was flattered by what you said earlier.
Leslie Knope,"No, here's fine."
Leslie Knope,Strictly professional.
Leslie Knope,Just friends.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"I know you're gonna take this the wrong way, but can I talk to you for a second?"
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Joe."
Leslie Knope,A douche-vestigation.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Tom."
Leslie Knope,This'll be a fun game.
Leslie Knope,Three wishes.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Leslie Knope,Wendy?
Leslie Knope,"So, the only thing that's important to you is hotness?"
Leslie Knope,Where I graduated summa cum laude in history.
Leslie Knope,"Harvest Festival more like ""Harvest Bestival."""
Leslie Knope,"The Parks Department has planted the seeds, and now, they're harvesting the rewards."
Leslie Knope,I once kissed a girl in college.
Leslie Knope,That's what you do.
Leslie Knope,I work at the Parks and Recreation--
Leslie Knope,They'll put the fun in funnel cake.
Leslie Knope,I've read five biographies of Eleanor Roosevelt.
Leslie Knope,I love sunshine and fresh air and early morning walks.
Leslie Knope,Ready?
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna say stuff about me, and you say, on a scale from 1 to 10, how interested in that thing you are."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm done."
Leslie Knope,Let's play a different game.
Leslie Knope,We don't have to do this anymore.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"He works for the state government, and he's been coming to advise us about our budget."
Leslie Knope,Wish number two.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,This just in.
Leslie Knope,They're just pizza that's harder to eat.
Leslie Knope,Calzones are pointless.
Leslie Knope,"Down on ""Terrible Idea Avenue."""
Leslie Knope,It's not Everything isn't your fault all the time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hey."
Leslie Knope,"You're stupid, and you're drunk and you're stupid."
Leslie Knope,All I need to do is focus and stay calm.
Leslie Knope,"This is a watershed moment in our relationship, and it's important that we fight clean."
Leslie Knope,But I believe that honest discussions between friends can lead to deeper intimacy.
Leslie Knope,What's happening here?
Leslie Knope,"This is my first fight with Ann, and it's a doozy."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,She's moving back to Canada.
Leslie Knope,"He's fine with it, he said it wouldn't be weird."
Leslie Knope,Dance up on me.
Leslie Knope,Jean-Ralphio!
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,"Go get me another ""Snork Juice."""
Leslie Knope,Do you want to dance with me?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm very angry, and I'm really drunk."
Leslie Knope,"No offense, but I don't remember you having a nursing degree in feelings."
Leslie Knope,"No offense, but I'm going slow because I might lose my job."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Neither am I.
Leslie Knope,"If you're worried about working with Chris, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,Ron and Wendy aren't even dating anymore.
Leslie Knope,Don't always make everything your fault.
Leslie Knope,I didn't mean it like that.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I think I owe you one, too."
Leslie Knope,"I owe her, like, a million apologies."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe that fight I had with Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am out of questions."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I've never been this hung over.
Leslie Knope,I'm so hung over.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm here.
Leslie Knope,Your mother's butt.
Leslie Knope,"And then she asked me the whole thing, and I didn't even do it once."
Leslie Knope,I didn't even say one thing.
Leslie Knope,You don't even know one thing.
Leslie Knope,"I know why you're doing this, and you're making a huge mistake."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we shouldn't work together, then."
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to do you a favor.
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes if I don't push you in the right direction, you end up standing still."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm sorry that I thought about you for the job, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I just meant you were being stupid, and you were acting like a jerk."
Leslie Knope,You know I didn't mean it like that.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Swanson!"
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm sad."
Leslie Knope,Snap out of it!
Leslie Knope,I'm not-- Are you-- You seem mad at me.
Leslie Knope,And I was hoping that maybe you would reduce his charges and release him into my custody.
Leslie Knope,I'll do my best.
Leslie Knope,That's good advice for all of us.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, stop."
Leslie Knope,So you're helping Tom.
Leslie Knope,"For the millionth time, no."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out later.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, JeanRalphio."
Leslie Knope,People will definitely buy it.
Leslie Knope,Ron is a good man who just got caught up in something terrible.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be fine.
Leslie Knope,"High end, VIP, exclusive."
Leslie Knope,Here?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Snake Juice!
Leslie Knope,That already is too many times.
Leslie Knope,It happened once.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Ron Swanson, this is an intervention."
Leslie Knope,"And let's be honest, it would be nice to not have to pull strange things out of people's butts every night."
Leslie Knope,You have been spending the last 24 hours sipping on joy juice and tripping on Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how's it going?"
Leslie Knope,"Chief, I need to ask you a huge favor."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, I completely understand."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I know tonight's gonna be a big success, and I wish I could stay."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What the hell happened to you?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this hat is an idiot."
Leslie Knope,How long is it gonna last with this guy?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, let's be honest."
Leslie Knope,They come and go so fast.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I should've known better than to loan something to one of your boyfriends."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's okay."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,So how did you two meet?
Leslie Knope,I actually was on your show once--
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I had met you before."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,But you are going in for the interview tomorrow?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe you'd be home preparing for tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'm surprised."
Leslie Knope,And I'm seeing you here.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,She's gonna be up all night cramming for a big job interview.
Leslie Knope,"I really do, but I have to go help Ann."
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad at you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the people in this room are your methadone."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm gonna tell you what I tell all my girlfriends when they get dumped."
Leslie Knope,Men are dogs.
Leslie Knope,Get away from me.
Leslie Knope,It's like stepping on a lamb.
Leslie Knope,Their bath mats are amazing.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Me too.
Leslie Knope,They have the softest towels.
Leslie Knope,Have you been to the Granville Hotel and Spa?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, maybe we could just point out to them there are tons of hotel rooms just outside city limits."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"According to their rules, we may not have enough hotel rooms within city limits."
Leslie Knope,What the hell?
Leslie Knope,"He's not worth it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Whale sounds.
Leslie Knope,Chief Trumple?
Leslie Knope,"It's an amazing instrument, the banjo."
Leslie Knope,You know Ben Wyatt from the State Budget Office.
Leslie Knope,Ann and I burned an awesome CD for the trip.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,We'll check in with you later.
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,Did you see this?
Leslie Knope,I'm allergic to fingers.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should just not talk to each other for the rest of the trip, and I'm just gonna concentrate on the presentation."
Leslie Knope,"And, so, as you can see, Pawnee has 12 beautiful baseball diamonds, and our seats have extra cushioning due to the massive size of our average citizen."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then, it's just us then."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Last chance.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, photographer."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure they have great burgers there, though."
Leslie Knope,They have great burgers.
Leslie Knope,You wanna grab some grub?
Leslie Knope,You want in?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we were thinking about going to dinner, photographer."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You should take the praise.
Leslie Knope,"This time, you did it."
Leslie Knope,"No, normally I do it."
Leslie Knope,"Can I have two beers, please?"
Leslie Knope,You did it.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, cheers, sir!"
Leslie Knope,"They have their part of the town, and we have ours."
Leslie Knope,The raccoon problem is under control.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Leslie Knope,Take it easy.
Leslie Knope,But we can't give you your job back.
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I was thinking about you when I wrote it.
Leslie Knope,You're so welcome.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,That's me!
Leslie Knope,But work is third.
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,"Or waffles, friends, work."
Leslie Knope,"Friends, waffles, and work."
Leslie Knope,We need to remember what's important in life.
Leslie Knope,Win-win.
Leslie Knope,"Cause I was, um"
Leslie Knope,"She works at City Hall part-time, and two days a week, she still gets to be the greatest nurse in the world."
Leslie Knope,"But really, she's just a manipulative, psychotic, library book peddling, sex crazed shedemon."
Leslie Knope,So they struck up a deal.
Leslie Knope,But she doesn't want to totally leave her job.
Leslie Knope,"She nailed it, of course."
Leslie Knope,Shall we? Ann came in the next day and had a second interview with Chris.
Leslie Knope,Would you mind if I joined you?
Leslie Knope,The committee totally understands.
Leslie Knope,"Please, don't worry about it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this committee would like to ask if you are the kind of candidate who could forgive someone after they've behaved like a complete jackass?"
Leslie Knope,"All right, who's next? You came."
Leslie Knope,I know Tammy seems scary.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I guess we should head over there.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let me handle this."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so, basically every dorm allows bed lofting, but the students have really taken to it at Wolman and McCoy."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm in control.
Leslie Knope,"We could talk about different dorms at Johns Hopkins University, and I could read from my Sonicare booklet."
Leslie Knope,"We could discuss The New Yorker article ""The History of the Ladder."""
Leslie Knope,I have a few ideas.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, what the hell are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,"I need to think of unsexy, boring conversation topics we can talk about in the car."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I could literally get ""afired."""
Leslie Knope,I need to send out a signal that nothing is gonna happen.
Leslie Knope,"I need, like, a sweat suit or something."
Leslie Knope,This is actually the dress that Julia Roberts wore as a prostitute in Pretty Woman.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, everything you have is too sexy."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Good plan.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,We could both get fired.
Leslie Knope,It can't happen.
Leslie Knope,Ben.
Leslie Knope,"I'll see you there, Benjamin."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, great small talk over there."
Leslie Knope,You don't want to waste away at Pawnee St. Joseph's medical center and turn into her.
Leslie Knope,And we're here to get you clean.
Leslie Knope,This is your destiny Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now."
Leslie Knope,that the EagletonPawnee fence does a lot more harm than it does good.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"You know if I had your job, there would be no fence there."
Leslie Knope,Pun intended.
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to get off your high horse, Lindsay."
Leslie Knope,I would not.
Leslie Knope,"What, did you just come from the stables?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, nice outfit."
Leslie Knope,"And by July, finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable, all the wealthy people evacuated to Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would like to respectfully say that any child should be able to play in any park, regardless of wealth or status."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee was established in May of 1817.
Leslie Knope,Factoid alert.
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,"The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income."
Leslie Knope,But their people are not inherently better than our people.
Leslie Knope,"And, yes, because of their cupcake factory, the air always smells like vanilla."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Eagleton is nicer than Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's not that great."
Leslie Knope,What did I say instead?
Leslie Knope,That's what I would've said if I had thought of it in the moment.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wide awake, and I got my eyes on you."
Leslie Knope,Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, this is Joey Plunkett."
Leslie Knope,"Joey, wave to the audience."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you can't, because you broke your arm climbing that fence."
Leslie Knope,Whatever happens to Ron Swanson is on you.
Leslie Knope,"I am so sick of this, Lindsay."
Leslie Knope,Let's back it up.
Leslie Knope,Put everything back in the truck.
Leslie Knope,What am I thinking? Let's just stop this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,And then we're just gonna let the stink and the raccoons run wild.
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna take these bags of trash, and we're gonna throw it over to their side of the park."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna treat them like garbage.
Leslie Knope,Eagleton treats us like garbage.
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody just grab a bag and open it up and then try to find some dirty stuff in there."
Leslie Knope,"And then they offered her the job, and she took it and disappeared."
Leslie Knope,"I talked it over with Lindsay, and we made a pact that we would stay in Pawnee together and work hard and fight to make Pawnee a better place to live."
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, Eagleton offered me that job."
Leslie Knope,Eagleton really changed her.
Leslie Knope,"Man, she used to not be like this."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, not you too."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, let's go."
Leslie Knope,I'm not done.
Leslie Knope,You cannot be sure that he is the one.
Leslie Knope,"Well, with more due respect, a lot of boys do that in our town."
Leslie Knope,Both your arms are broken.
Leslie Knope,"No, you can't."
Leslie Knope,I'm awake.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you did a really crappy thing, and I think deep down, you know that."
Leslie Knope,I'm not asleep.
Leslie Knope,"Lindsay, if we"
Leslie Knope,"I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence."
Leslie Knope,This woman's right.
Leslie Knope,That's arson.
Leslie Knope,I just need you to do what's on that list.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I am on ""Operation No More Fence,"" so I'm putting you in charge of ""Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier."
Leslie Knope,"We should stand up for our town, okay?"
Leslie Knope,But it has a lot of heart.
Leslie Knope,Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.
Leslie Knope,"To be fair, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Her soul.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,What a relief.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"You know, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"There's a really great calzone place over in ""Idiotville."""
Leslie Knope,What was it again?
Leslie Knope,"Then she went to work in Eagleton and ""fixed her deviated septum"" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else."
Leslie Knope,We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.
Leslie Knope,"Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."
Leslie Knope,"The crisis has been averted, so let's go talk to the chief."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Lindsay!
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And I have a JPEG.
Leslie Knope,I have many copies and the negatives.
Leslie Knope,You can take it if you want.
Leslie Knope,And that someone was this woman.
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas."
Leslie Knope,Wowsers.
Leslie Knope,That's what makes them so great.
Leslie Knope,"When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you."
Leslie Knope,So let's talk about Lafayette Park.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I found a picture of you from back in the day."
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you so much for stopping by."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Shall we speak in my courtyard?
Leslie Knope,It's really nice outside.
Leslie Knope,"And she's a nurse, and she works at a hospital."
Leslie Knope,Now.
Leslie Knope,She is my best friend.
Leslie Knope,This is Ann.
Leslie Knope,Sorry about the whole mess.
Leslie Knope,You look amazing.
Leslie Knope,It has.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"You might have a fancy car and a mahogany purse, or whatever rich people have, but I remember something that you're trying to forget."
Leslie Knope,You're a Pawnee girl.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then why do you come here at dinnertime and get takeout from the legendary J.J's Diner?"
Leslie Knope,Nice to see you as always.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Howser, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, move!"
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, got to go."
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Race you.
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I could get that book back that I loaned him?
Leslie Knope,I liked him.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,The photographer guy.
Leslie Knope,How's Jessie?
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's start with the personal stuff."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so glad we found this time to talk ,it feels like it's been forever."
Leslie Knope,What does Kahlua style mean?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, let's not fight, I broke it, let me pay for it Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I did, I broke"
Leslie Knope,"Next year, your birthday party is going to be a rager."
Leslie Knope,"This, by the way, is a onetime only situation."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's how I remember it."
Leslie Knope,Uhuh.
Leslie Knope,Ann should do it.
Leslie Knope,Powerful stuff.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, what is this?"
Leslie Knope,No more lightning round catchup sessions.
Leslie Knope,This is an intervention.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we'd be working in the same building."
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's begin."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Make real change happen.
Leslie Knope,"I just think with this new job, you could make a difference."
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And I want to talk to you about Patty.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sit down."
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"Because I'm almost done with it, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"And it's gonna be a long night, so I got you some energy drinks and some chocolate covered espresso beans and the book Freedom by Jonathan Franzen."
Leslie Knope,So you need to partially memorize that.
Leslie Knope,These are all the health initiatives the city has ever undertaken since the 1960s.
Leslie Knope,"But first, you need to go over your homework."
Leslie Knope,You can thank me later.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't get it earlier.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I know."
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Leslie Knope,That was you on the tape.
Leslie Knope,That was you talking.
Leslie Knope,"Right, but after, when I pressed you?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"and the worst part, to her our friendship it's like it never happened."
Leslie Knope,because we were best friends and then she sold out everything that we believed in.
Leslie Knope,I hope you're happy.
Leslie Knope,Because she's a stupid jerk.
Leslie Knope,"But in my defense, I believe that assault should be illegal if the person is a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"And punching Lindsay in the face, and shoving a coffee filter down her pants."
Leslie Knope,The only thing I'm guilty of is loving Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Scone? They only have maple walnut.
Leslie Knope,"It was a rough night, but I survived."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming to get me.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Did G.B. Shaw write your stupid fart face?
Leslie Knope,I doth proclaim to be a stupid fart face.
Leslie Knope,Nor I her.
Leslie Knope,I will never apologize to her.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,I want her arrested for attempted murder.
Leslie Knope,How dare you? No!
Leslie Knope,Don't you dare feed that waffle to that dog to get it to poop.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think it's 'cause I wanted to shatter the glass ceiling.
Leslie Knope,"Wait a minute, oh my god, okay we have a lot of work to do."
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Do you remember what you said to me five years ago when Eagleton offered me that job and I asked you for advice?
Leslie Knope,and a cab will be here whenever you're ready to take you home.
Leslie Knope,Artie from security is outside the door so no one will bother you.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have rented Bridge on the River Kwai and the Dirty Dozen."
Leslie Knope,She do them all?
Leslie Knope,That was just a list of ways to mess with you.
Leslie Knope,why would I throw Ron Swanson an Ann Perkins party?
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,I did that for Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Happy birthday, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"God, please."
Leslie Knope,Ben and chris want us to go into conference room C for a meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, don't do that."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, did you hear the news?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I work with some really great people."
Leslie Knope,I know you do.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, I thought maybe you could bust out your old Jazz sweatshirt and you and I could go to Sullivan's for a beer."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing tonight?
Leslie Knope,One of the many Eagleton kids who signed up will just pop over and grab it.
Leslie Knope,"and I want to thank you for the fence, there's no way we could afford that high quality wood."
Leslie Knope,It's an idea that I came up with after my best friend Ann over there said she wanted to bash your head in with a baseball bat.
Leslie Knope,"Hey Lindsay, introducing the Pawnee wiffle ball league."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, put these scones in your bra, let's go."
Leslie Knope,I tried.
Leslie Knope,I never should have opened that stupid basket.
Leslie Knope,You're here.
Leslie Knope,Try to look professional.
Leslie Knope,Go clean yourself up.
Leslie Knope,"Gosh, you're filthy."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,The curse has been lifted.
Leslie Knope,Special Wamapoke ceremony.
Leslie Knope,Yes. This is him.
Leslie Knope,And I'm glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, while you're doing that, I want you to picture Ben in his motel room, all by himself with no friends, staring at the wall."
Leslie Knope,"It's ours, and it's going to be really great."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, this project, this is as much yours as it is mine."
Leslie Knope,"Ice Town was a disaster, and it seems like it was probably your fault."
Leslie Knope,Look who's back.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Enjoy yourself, ladies."
Leslie Knope,Have fun.
Leslie Knope,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,Welcome.
Leslie Knope,"The one, the only, Little Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,"And in other good news, he gave us a scare, but he's back now."
Leslie Knope,Intense stuff from Ken Hotate.
Leslie Knope,"From what I can tell, you mismanaged the hell out of it."
Leslie Knope,Enjoy yourselves.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I like your necklace.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have ideas, Ron."
Leslie Knope,This camping trip is our chance to think of some really big ideas.
Leslie Knope,We do not wanna have a sophomore slump.
Leslie Knope,Harvest Fest is over.
Leslie Knope,We're all gonna meet here and leave as a group at 6:45 a.m. promptly.
Leslie Knope,Don't let us picture that.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you gonna go?"
Leslie Knope,Just a few notes about our camping retreat tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, I want you to take Ben and make him go to that anti-histamine party."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, listen up."
Leslie Knope,"All right, guys."
Leslie Knope,That was the second most awkward way a man has ever grabbed my breast.
Leslie Knope,He doesn't know anybody in town.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Tom, take him under your tiny little wing."
Leslie Knope,Call 911!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Holy!
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Oh, my gosh."
Leslie Knope,"Paul, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ben, you just missed it! He whinnied!"
Leslie Knope,"You finally get it now, right?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I have, like, 100 new ideas."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ken."
Leslie Knope,It will not be a disaster.
Leslie Knope,"And at no time was any Parks Department worker, quote, ""feasting on petting zoo animals."""
Leslie Knope,"There are not, as one reporter suggested, dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival."
Leslie Knope,There is no food shortage.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, we have plenty of food."
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,This?
Leslie Knope,"But does it say, ""Hello, general assembly, I've come to Indianapolis to accept your commendation?"""
Leslie Knope,I'd like to start by addressing some of the false rumors about the festival.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,It will be a success.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,How do you know?
Leslie Knope,Then I'm sure he's not cheating on you.
Leslie Knope,"And if he is, he's a monster."
Leslie Knope,Maybe that will make them happy.
Leslie Knope,That seems to be their biggest problem.
Leslie Knope,"And if he's not, you guys are great together."
Leslie Knope,"But if he is, I will kill him."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it sounds like you're just spiraling."
Leslie Knope,That lying bastard!
Leslie Knope,"And I want to let everyone know that, in an attempt to be sensitive to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved the shooting gallery, per their request."
Leslie Knope,"So, yes, Perd."
Leslie Knope,"Perd, you know as well as I do that there's no such God."
Leslie Knope,Can you help me out here?
Leslie Knope,"I'm just trying to do something good for this town, and I'm trying to save my friends' jobs."
Leslie Knope,"I am prepared to put the Wamapoke history exhibit inside the carnival grounds, right past the entrance turnstile, so that you have to look at it before you start having fun."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but this is not a trick."
Leslie Knope,"A trick, and over 50 Wamapoke were slaughtered."
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I am coming to you on my knees, begging for help, much like the early settlers of Pawnee begged the Wamapoke--"
Leslie Knope,Now it's just turned into a note that say I want to see other people.
Leslie Knope,This festival was supposed to be my love letter to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,You've got to be kidding me.
Leslie Knope,"How and where can I get a new one in, like, I don't know, now?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Let me tell you something, freedom of press is for the birds."
Leslie Knope,I knew it. Stupid media.
Leslie Knope,How could that happen?
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ed."
Leslie Knope,I got the T.M.K. 2500 specifically for the extra capacity.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,We cannot catch a break.
Leslie Knope,"Please, we'll get this up and running in no time."
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, relax."
Leslie Knope,Crap on a spatula.
Leslie Knope,"Well, actually, I have another idea."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, the pressure is on."
Leslie Knope,All of it.
Leslie Knope,And then we got it and we're good.
Leslie Knope,And what we need to do is just keep working and just work again more and just do it and get it.
Leslie Knope,"But I don't have anything, and we're totally screwed."
Leslie Knope,"I thought if we all worked really hard, I could come up with something."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,What do you think? I don't have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Here it is.
Leslie Knope,We have a great idea.
Leslie Knope,Really well.
Leslie Knope,Super great.
Leslie Knope,Go with that.
Leslie Knope,That was me talking.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,"So, I have to keep thinking about good ideas all the time, or I'm no longer myself?"
Leslie Knope,"What if the festival was, like, a high point for me, and I never do anything better than that?"
Leslie Knope,"She's showing some elephant-- Ooh, la la."
Leslie Knope,Look who's fancy.
Leslie Knope,I'm probably making too much out of it.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, this new project idea, it's not really a big deal."
Leslie Knope,"It's gorgeous, but is it worth the asthma?"
Leslie Knope,It's pollution from the Sweetums factory.
Leslie Knope,You wanna go for a walk?
Leslie Knope,Listen up.
Leslie Knope,You're not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,No one's going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,No one's sleeping because this is an all-nighter.
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well okay, I would love to chit-chat about this, but I need to keep working and keep pushing, so my breakthrough will happen and I will be ready for it."
Leslie Knope,"For the first time ever, the Parks department has real momentum and I'm gonna ruin it for everybody."
Leslie Knope,"What was her name? Kim? Anyway, who cares, she's stupid and she's dead."
Leslie Knope,"And although it's purely ceremonial, it's a huge deal for me to go to the Statehouse."
Leslie Knope,And never came up with another idea again? What happened to her?
Leslie Knope,"Years from now, people are gonna say, ""Remember that woman that came up with the harvest festival idea? """
Leslie Knope,"I peaked at the Harvest Festival, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will be."
Leslie Knope,"I am listening to ""Steal My Sunshine"" by Len, a one-hit wonder like me."
Leslie Knope,Sounds delightful.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, couldn't sleep?"
Leslie Knope,"One day, there's gonna be a plaque there that reads, ""This is where Leslie Knope came up with the amazing idea for"" Damn, I thought that would work."
Leslie Knope,I have a good feeling about this B&B.
Leslie Knope,Let's keep brainstorming.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so much fun! All night work! All night work! All night work!
Leslie Knope,"So, we can work all night."
Leslie Knope,"You wanted to leave, and now you're stuck here with me."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this is a sign."
Leslie Knope,"We'll all stay up and then, I'll be like, ""Hey! No one sleep!"" Do you hear how loud that is? You're not sleeping through that."
Leslie Knope,And that'll be fun.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,We only have one chance to make a second impression.
Leslie Knope,I just need an hour and it'll come to me.
Leslie Knope,It was.
Leslie Knope,"We need big ideas, and we need 'em now."
Leslie Knope,"Great attitude, Ron."
Leslie Knope,It divides our time evenly between work and play.
Leslie Knope,Here is our official retreat schedule.
Leslie Knope,I'll give you first dibs on s'mores.
Leslie Knope,You can brainstorm.
Leslie Knope,You'll be away from Chris.
Leslie Knope,It'll be really fun.
Leslie Knope,Come camping with us.
Leslie Knope,"Remember, this is the guy that was so upbeat and positive, when he broke up with you, you didn't even know it happened."
Leslie Knope,Who wants to go first?
Leslie Knope,Do not read into this.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,He was an amazing dentist.
Leslie Knope,But it was really hard to stay mad at him.
Leslie Knope,"Well, there was an ex that I still liked after he broke up with me."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, the Pawnee Sun said that my chest saved his life."
Leslie Knope,"He had a heart attack, which required an octuple bypass."
Leslie Knope,Paul did not die.
Leslie Knope,My boob does not kill.
Leslie Knope,It's a mandatory work retreat.
Leslie Knope,Can't pass.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"So, how much would that be per person?"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to tell us any more?
Leslie Knope,"I'm so desperate, I even brought in my dream journal, hoping it would inspire me."
Leslie Knope,"We need a big, juicy idea."
Leslie Knope,They're filled with small ideas.
Leslie Knope,Chris wants the new project to generate revenue.
Leslie Knope,"The meeting is tomorrow, and I don't have anything."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so screwed, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I don't have an idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Because I don't have one.
Leslie Knope,I didn't wanna tell them my idea.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I had no choice."
Leslie Knope,"Then, after that, I will tell you my idea."
Leslie Knope,"And also, see if you're interested in contributing to this department."
Leslie Knope,Go clear your heads and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use.
Leslie Knope,Take an hour.
Leslie Knope,And you're letting 'em down.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the whole town is looking at us right now."
Leslie Knope,I am really disappointed in all of you.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,April has not presented her idea.
Leslie Knope,And he's a valuable asset to the team.
Leslie Knope,"Ben helped us launch the Harvest Festival, and he knows how Chris's mind works."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You're probably right.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's happening?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What we do is we move the shooting gallery.
Leslie Knope,"Of course, nobody's going to come to your stupid booth anyway."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, I'm sorry, you know what we'll do, we'll make Sue's Salads the official healthy choice of the festival."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we want to make money, not make people hate themselves."
Leslie Knope,On Deep Fried Boulevard?
Leslie Knope,Get out.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it amazing?
Leslie Knope,You sure you're not expecting company or something?
Leslie Knope,Jerry's going to look after him.
Leslie Knope,He has severe arthritis.
Leslie Knope,And he has cataracts in both eyes.
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is the biggest thing I've ever done in my career.
Leslie Knope,This little guy is 25 now.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,We all need to be very careful.
Leslie Knope,"So suck it, the Alamo."
Leslie Knope,That week he was the eighth most photographed object in America.
Leslie Knope,"Little Sebastian made his debut at the last Harvest Festival in 1987, and he was an instant phenomenon."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"So, Chris, do you have any sisters?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,So how's your mom?
Leslie Knope,Is she visiting?
Leslie Knope,Remember.
Leslie Knope,"And if it fails, the Parks Department will be eliminated."
Leslie Knope,That's why we're going big.
Leslie Knope,"Seven days, over 30 different locations, 50,000 plus visitors and four hospitality kiosks."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it looks like they're closed for some kind of health code violation."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, stop it!"
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,This is a map of all the atrocities the Pawnee settlers inflicted upon the Wamapoke Indians.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you know with Pawnee's history, it's very difficult to not be offensive."
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I understand, but this is the only place in town that's big enough to house the carnival rides."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"The carnival is on the site of the Battle of Indian Hill, which was an epic seven day battle that the Wamapoke lost due to the fact that they didn't have any weapons."
Leslie Knope,And just let me say that we really tried.
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I know why you're here."
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,The Wamapoke used to use possums as currency.
Leslie Knope,"I just said, hello honored guest. Although literally translated it means may you be blessed with a million possums."
Leslie Knope,He is the tribal leader of the Wamapoke.
Leslie Knope,This is Ken Hotate.
Leslie Knope,This is Ben and Tom.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ken."
Leslie Knope,Everyone has seen it.
Leslie Knope,"No, Star Wars is not that nerdy."
Leslie Knope,"April, who's next?"
Leslie Knope,"No you cannot sell home-brewed water, and no I would not like to taste it."
Leslie Knope,Clowns.
Leslie Knope,"God, I've got to stop ending on that boring thing."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the world famous Little Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,The atrocities are in blue.
Leslie Knope,Any aunts?
Leslie Knope,"So, I have a surprise."
Leslie Knope,"She's my best friend, and anyone who hurt her is someone I would murder, probably."
Leslie Knope,And then he broke up with me.
Leslie Knope,"""Rebecca's coming."""
Leslie Knope,"Another time, a guy invited me to a beautiful picnic with wine and flowers, and then, when I tried to sit down, he said, ""Don't eat anything."""
Leslie Knope,Skywriting isn't always positive.
Leslie Knope,One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.
Leslie Knope,"One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me to never call him again."
Leslie Knope,"And then the guy said he wasn't ""feeling it,"" so he left and I waited for an ambulance."
Leslie Knope,There was another time where I was on a date and I tripped and broke my kneecap.
Leslie Knope,"One time, when I was in high school, a guy's mom called me and broke up with me for him."
Leslie Knope,You know what's funny about Ann?
Leslie Knope,Although it does kind of make you wonder how good of a nurse she is.
Leslie Knope,"Sweet and beautiful Ann has never been dumped before, and Chris is such a positive person, when he broke up with her, she just didn't realize it."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so here's what happened."
Leslie Knope,What's that about?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I found concealer in your medicine cabinet."
Leslie Knope,Or we can get one of those cows that we saw on the way up here and we'll bring it back and we'll make steaks out of that.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we'll find a 24 hour diner."
Leslie Knope,Could you get us a cold compress or something?
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Call me, let me know where you are, and if you have Ron?"
Leslie Knope,It's kind of understandable.
Leslie Knope,Yeah. Exactly.
Leslie Knope,How are things going with Ann?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's what you call it."
Leslie Knope,Girl cousins?
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.
Leslie Knope,You've worked so hard.
Leslie Knope,And I am so proud of all of you.
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"A youthful grandmother, perhaps?"
Leslie Knope,Are you okay? Is it that bad?
Leslie Knope,Ann's in kind of a crappy mood because Chris dumped her.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna kill him, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Sit with us.
Leslie Knope,Chris is cheating on Ann.
Leslie Knope,There's evidence everywhere.
Leslie Knope,She's coming up here so they can have it out.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look who's socializing!"
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know.
Leslie Knope,He'll go.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, Ron is staying behind."
Leslie Knope,I don't even care about it.
Leslie Knope,It's just a goofy ceremony.
Leslie Knope,"So, Chris, what do you do up here in your spare time?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, please."
Leslie Knope,"And it is possibly the best thing to potentially ever happen to anyone, anywhere, in the history of the universe."
Leslie Knope,"Well, luckily, I'm heading up there."
Leslie Knope,"We put up a memorial plaque, and we have a Wamapoke exhibit in the history tent."
Leslie Knope,"All right, okay."
Leslie Knope,"And then, you add the Wamapoke controversy."
Leslie Knope,"This is a huge government project, and it's already a lightning rod."
Leslie Knope,This is way worse than that.
Leslie Knope,This is like a poop tornado. This is like a poop-nado.
Leslie Knope,Yes this is bad.
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse."
Leslie Knope,It did.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Double lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,"If you would be willing to just take a brief pit stop, we could see Indiana's second largest rocking chair."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Then maybe we should take a quick two hour sojourn to Dame Gervin's Misshapen Celebrity Castle.
Leslie Knope,"It's where Madame Tussaud sends all of its failed wax figures, and if you can figure out who it is, you get to take it home."
Leslie Knope,It's going to be sweet.
Leslie Knope,"Come on down, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"What's wrong with you, grouchy pants?"
Leslie Knope,Not even I could screw that up.
Leslie Knope,"Fasting's not healthy for you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Look, Joan, this festival, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is going to bring people nothing but happiness."
Leslie Knope,He is so adorable.
Leslie Knope,That went well.
Leslie Knope,It's a mini-horse.
Leslie Knope,And that's the third lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,Triple lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,I'll invite him out to dinner and I'll poke around a little bit.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not gonna be able to keep anything from me."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,None of that happened.
Leslie Knope,"Run, Ann, run!"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, just treat him and release him, and then, don't say anything to anyone about anything for the rest of the month."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.
Leslie Knope,You're so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Good, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"You've got to say ""No comment."""
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""No comment""?"
Leslie Knope,"In high school, they used to call me Angela Lansbury."
Leslie Knope,But that was because of my haircut.
Leslie Knope,No comment.
Leslie Knope,The year was 1973.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is an incredibly superstitious town. A travelling magician came through one time and he pulled a rabbit out of a hat, and the mob burned him at the stake for being a witch."
Leslie Knope,"God, now all the vendors are going to bail, and the ticket sales will go down."
Leslie Knope,It's a classic four-rod distaster.
Leslie Knope,Quadruple lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you have the curse."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"I forgot to tell you, Chris Traeger is joining us for dinner tonight."
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,"And I really want you to have fun today and not focus on the fact that if one thing goes wrong, we're all going to lose our jobs."
Leslie Knope,"You're all amazing, wonderful people."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's grab hands.
Leslie Knope,So this is some kind of coat closet or something?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, there's a lot of men's coats in here."
Leslie Knope,Could I use your bathroom really quick?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Toilet seat's up.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, gather around."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Just one second.
Leslie Knope,I found a woman's razor in Chris's shower and a pink swimming cap.
Leslie Knope,She's like an eagleeyed tiger.
Leslie Knope,Joan is always looking for a scandal.
Leslie Knope,"So, everything needs to be perfect."
Leslie Knope,"Joan Callamezzo is coming by with a camera crew for an exclusive, last minute walkthrough of the Harvest Festival before we open tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so guys, focus up."
Leslie Knope,"Ow, ow, ow!"
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse."
Leslie Knope,"You know, it could be nothing, but it feels like something."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I think you might be right."
Leslie Knope,"Let's go get them, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Any concerns, address them to Ron."
Leslie Knope,But the real coup is over there.
Leslie Knope,"No, we are picking him up."
Leslie Knope,We got Tilda.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Look at your foyer.
Leslie Knope,It's like a spa in here.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Over in this booth, Indiana basketball legend Larry Bird's Aunt Tilda will be signing autographs for two hours on Thursday."
Leslie Knope,They're all U.S citizens.
Leslie Knope,None.
Leslie Knope,"Over here, we have our beautiful Ferris wheel."
Leslie Knope,And it's organic.
Leslie Knope,Ron doesn't even have a front door.
Leslie Knope,He won't even tell me his address.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee corn.
Leslie Knope,Ask him where he lives.
Leslie Knope,And over here is Indiana's largest corn maze.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the festival is spread throughout the town, but the centerpiece is the carnival."
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.
Leslie Knope,You remember Ben.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Joan."
Leslie Knope,See for yourself.
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, the Parks and Rec Department is receiving a commendation at the Indiana Statehouse for bringing the Harvest Festival back."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Mixing it up with the boys!
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Call me.
Leslie Knope,Banter's fun.
Leslie Knope,That should be some damage control.
Leslie Knope,I'm having dinner with Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,This is banter.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, what do we have?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like this."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at those bitches clean up after me."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you gotta loosen up."
Leslie Knope,"The boys' club is more about socializing than work, you know?"
Leslie Knope,That was the sound of a glass ceiling being shattered.
Leslie Knope,Did you hear that?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,What's the topic du jour?
Leslie Knope,"So, what are you guys talking about?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Deputy director of--
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Brian, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,I kind of feel like I'm already in the boys' club.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So What are you gonna say?
Leslie Knope,What's your comeback?
Leslie Knope,"Last night, I opened up this gift basket, for my own pleasure."
Leslie Knope,Let's clear the air.
Leslie Knope,There it is.
Leslie Knope,Melissa Bean.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,"Tammy Baldwin, Democrat, Wisconsin."
Leslie Knope,I am sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Michele Bachmann, Republican, Minnesota."
Leslie Knope,"I realize I have let down every female public official in America, and I would like to apologize to them, right now, individually, and in alphabetical order."
Leslie Knope,"I have always tried to live my life in an ethical way, and last night, I failed."
Leslie Knope,"Last night, in a foolish attempt to infiltrate a boys' club, I violated the government employee ethics code of the state of Indiana."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,And cheese!
Leslie Knope,I got wine!
Leslie Knope,Just hold on a second.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait."
Leslie Knope,It's just getting started!
Leslie Knope,Let's keep this good feeling going.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, you guys!"
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,You need to hit harder!
Leslie Knope,"Brendanawicz, that's some weak sauce."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boo."
Leslie Knope,We're in.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not happy about it either, Tom."
Leslie Knope,A couple of ladies are coming to bust up your little boys' club.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Kids.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"April, that's good."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I love a good ribbon cutting.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready for the debut?"
Leslie Knope,I asked April to create one of those social network Internet profiles for the Sullivan Street pit.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,"And so to avoid temptation, I am gonna lock it up."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said that."
Leslie Knope,That's why I go two towns over if I want to rent a movie with nudity in it.
Leslie Knope,We live in a fish bowl and the public is always watching.
Leslie Knope,"You know as well as I do that we are not allowed to accept gifts over 25 dollars, for corruption reasons."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,Ooh.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,We still have the Pawnee Today interview.
Leslie Knope,This is fun.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"But you cannot enjoy this basket, I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,Mark's a friend.
Leslie Knope,Maybe those are his relatives.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we're good."
Leslie Knope,And it's because you're a woman!
Leslie Knope,"April, we're leaving, you're in charge."
Leslie Knope,"That's good, think like a man."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,We deserve to be included.
Leslie Knope,We're doing great work in the government.
Leslie Knope,Let's bust up that old boys' club.
Leslie Knope,Let's go out there.
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?
Leslie Knope,Divvying up the empire.
Leslie Knope,Wheeling and dealing.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at my chest."
Leslie Knope,Especially because of that guy.
Leslie Knope,It can be very upsetting.
Leslie Knope,"And every day, as a woman, I have to walk past this wall of men."
Leslie Knope,Behind me are all the members of the city council over the past 30 years.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, we need to focus."
Leslie Knope,"Politics is full of boys' clubs, formal and informal."
Leslie Knope,Attending yet another meeting of the old boys' club.
Leslie Knope,We'll keep checking in on this.
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's up.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I did."
Leslie Knope,Two wrongs do not make a right.
Leslie Knope,Timeout.
Leslie Knope,"No, okay."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Zero to six.
Leslie Knope,Are they gonna ask that?
Leslie Knope,Timeout.
Leslie Knope,Never.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Zero to six.
Leslie Knope,Zero.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that'd be great."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,"I've spoken to you a couple of times about something that happened, but I don't want to-- I don't want to talk about it anymore."
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,I need something to drink.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I meant water.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I just wanted to say thank you, so--"
Leslie Knope,Are we done?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,I awoke at 6:21 a.m. after a fitful night of sleep.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course."
Leslie Knope,The biggest crime we could commit here would be to destroy a teenage girl's passion for local government.
Leslie Knope,Please don't blame her for my mistake.
Leslie Knope,"""Though it is my hope that someday, she lives in a world where the very idea of boys' clubs is ancient history."""
Leslie Knope,"""I repeat, not been invited."""
Leslie Knope,"""She had not been invited to the meeting of the boys' club."""
Leslie Knope,"""That was never part of the plan."""
Leslie Knope,"""Our intern, April Ludgate, drank some of that wine without my knowledge."""
Leslie Knope,"""I opened a gift basket of wine and cheese."""
Leslie Knope,"""A decision that will live in infamy."""
Leslie Knope,"""After one and a half beers, awash in the glow of acceptance into this elite, exclusive club"""
Leslie Knope,"""Two days ago, I attended an informal boys' club meeting for the very first time."""
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna take a glass of water first, if I may."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Nonetheless.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for being here with me today."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Where are you?
Leslie Knope,And I would do it again.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, tell me it's gonna be okay."
Leslie Knope,"Good, because the coverup is worse than the crime."
Leslie Knope,You think we should cover this up?
Leslie Knope,What do you suggest we do?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,But I am a woman and I need to hold myself up to a higher standard.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,How did it go?
Leslie Knope,"You're a white Protestant man with a full, rich mustache."
Leslie Knope,Maybe in your world it isn't a big deal.
Leslie Knope,The minimum punishment for this is an official reprimand from the city manager.
Leslie Knope,"When you spill something and you try to wipe it up with something that's dirty, then you get double dirty."
Leslie Knope,I will blow this in proportion!
Leslie Knope,"It happened right out there, right outside this window."
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,How did this happen?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have a very important and very long story to tell you."
Leslie Knope,I appreciate and thank you in advance for your unwavering support.
Leslie Knope,It's evidence.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,I did not know that at the time.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,You look psychotic.
Leslie Knope,Why can't I look away?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,"Since we last spoke, I have taken extraordinary steps to make further amends for the mistakes that I have made."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Please, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Help.
Leslie Knope,Ow.
Leslie Knope,This bench is so uncomfortable.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,And I heard you loud and clear.
Leslie Knope,"I just sent an email to everyone in the government, and I put a link to this page!"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take this off."
Leslie Knope,And you put it in the pit's web page?
Leslie Knope,Why did you do this?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What am I looking at?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,And that is why I had to whistle blow myself.
Leslie Knope,"I asked Ron to blow the whistle on me, and he refused."
Leslie Knope,"I've also attached a link to the pit's web page, just to remind people of all the good work that I do."
Leslie Knope,"I have written a full confession, which I will be emailing to everyone in the entire Pawnee government."
Leslie Knope,Tell me it's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, this is a little fun."
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Whoo, missed it!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out."
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this party needs a little help."
Leslie Knope,"Take a walk, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"No, a cake, but this is so much healthier."
Leslie Knope,What'd you bring?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself."
Leslie Knope,He's very intense and very weird.
Leslie Knope,Is April pregnant?
Leslie Knope,April's friend Orin is here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Nice talking to you.
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,That always works for me.
Leslie Knope,"Let's take some calls, Joan."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Caller, are you there?"
Leslie Knope,"Just to add to what Ben's stammering about, we aren't going to raise taxes."
Leslie Knope,"So, that's that."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody listen up."
Leslie Knope,Are you pregnant?
Leslie Knope,Are you sick?
Leslie Knope,Are you terminal?
Leslie Knope,You need to go to bed.
Leslie Knope,You relax all the way home and get into bed.
Leslie Knope,You relax.
Leslie Knope,It'll be a blast.
Leslie Knope,"Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Leslie Knope,But you know what would be fun?
Leslie Knope,"I know it doesn't work, from all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them."
Leslie Knope,Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Leslie Knope,"It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time!"
Leslie Knope,You just can't jump into something without thinking.
Leslie Knope,But relationships need planning.
Leslie Knope,I want them to stay together forever.
Leslie Knope,I love Andy and April as a couple.
Leslie Knope,You can't just get a condo.
Leslie Knope,"But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live."
Leslie Knope,That is a great story.
Leslie Knope,Why is this great thing happening?
Leslie Knope,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
Leslie Knope,Next caller?
Leslie Knope,You don't know each other's middle names?
Leslie Knope,You should make a pros and cons list.
Leslie Knope,It's a tough call.
Leslie Knope,"We could split the profits with the school, it'd be a lot of fun."
Leslie Knope,"Which could be part auction, part antique roadshow, then we could have professors come in and assign value to the objects."
Leslie Knope,We could have a city-wide yard sale.
Leslie Knope,"Good. We'll have theme night at the park. Have singles, date night, seniors."
Leslie Knope,"That way, we could sell tickets and have class trips."
Leslie Knope,We should buy a telescope and make the old ranger station in Ramsett Park an observatory.
Leslie Knope,"But I did wake up with a million ideas, and Ron would not let me have any paper, so I had to write them down on this doily."
Leslie Knope,"So I just slept 7 hours, which is twice as long as I usually sleep, so I'm little disoriented."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Bye Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Now, after we are given the certificate, who do you think should speak first?"
Leslie Knope,"But, if you want, it could be you and then me."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"Oh my God, there's like fifty cats in here."
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"Fair enough, I'm just gonna go to bed, call it a night."
Leslie Knope,"Or it could go me, you, me."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,All my binders are downstairs.
Leslie Knope,No Ron.
Leslie Knope,Ron. Ron what are you doing?
Leslie Knope,I think it should be me and then you.
Leslie Knope,They say you're only as good as your last idea.
Leslie Knope,I say you're only as good as the people you work with.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope is back.
Leslie Knope,"But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government."
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is a great city."
Leslie Knope,Do you wanna do that?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,I wanted your advice on something.
Leslie Knope,I was actually coming to see you.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,"What else you got, callers? Going once, going... Here we go."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will see you there, with all of those things."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,You going tonight?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,And we're all going.
Leslie Knope,It's very sweet.
Leslie Knope,I can't look away.
Leslie Knope,They're ready to show it to the world.
Leslie Knope,They're in love.
Leslie Knope,They're young.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,Oh my God my breath is so bad.
Leslie Knope,You know what I would do?
Leslie Knope,You don't have to.
Leslie Knope,"One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours."
Leslie Knope,And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
Leslie Knope,I work for the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Boys!
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,It's real.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I don't believe it.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,Run!
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,What do I Just keep talking to me.
Leslie Knope,"Don't panic, 'cause he can smell fear."
Leslie Knope,So just keep your eyes on me.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Leslie Knope,Help us build something.
Leslie Knope,And what are you gonna do? You gonna go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets? Stay here.
Leslie Knope,And you've made a lot of friends.
Leslie Knope,How are you? Good.
Leslie Knope,Cool it!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Who wants it?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go."
Leslie Knope,Boom!
Leslie Knope,You like it?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey!"
Leslie Knope,It's too late to cancel.
Leslie Knope,Joan Callamezzo runs this town.
Leslie Knope,"But Ben, don't worry about it."
Leslie Knope,You're not going in front of the camera.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Why would you think this was fun?
Leslie Knope,Smells so bad!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting!
Leslie Knope,"It's a great city here, you know? And there are great people."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Joan, actually, there's a lot of false information flying around."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is--
Leslie Knope,I just want everyone to know what an extraordinary event this is going to be.
Leslie Knope,I love April and Andy.
Leslie Knope,This is really happening.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,And nobody seems concerned about this.
Leslie Knope,"The point is two boneheads, whom I love dearly, are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Stay focused, okay?"
Leslie Knope,It depends on how frequently you use it.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,April and Andy are about to get married.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Leslie Knope,"And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends."
Leslie Knope,"If you come up too fast, you get the bends."
Leslie Knope,Relationships are like scuba diving.
Leslie Knope,"Help me, please!"
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
Leslie Knope,"I need you to get down here, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,April and Andy are getting married tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann, it's Leslie, Leslie Knope from the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,But the clothes thing really bothered me.
Leslie Knope,And he was married.
Leslie Knope,I want them to stay together.
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to be overdramatic, but today felt like 100 years in hell and the absolute worst day of my life."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt has done nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope,You know?
Leslie Knope,"If you want to ask him questions, let's go for it, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Just ask any question about his past or present.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You should stay here.
Leslie Knope,Just get it over with.
Leslie Knope,Don't go back to Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,You should stay.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,This is your day.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna say another word.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, let's get up here."
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,Weren't you married three times?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"We'll just ask him a bunch of questions, and then, we'll get everything cleared and out of the way."
Leslie Knope,They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Leslie Knope,I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
Leslie Knope,And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,You were really great in that presentation today.
Leslie Knope,You can change it if you want.
Leslie Knope,I'll get you a beer.
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could do that.
Leslie Knope,"So, what should my next tactic be?"
Leslie Knope,So no to the scarf?
Leslie Knope,"Well, everyone has their problems."
Leslie Knope,That is not conduct worthy of the zoning board.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm going to that meeting."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Secretary makes her schedule.
Leslie Knope,"That's good, right?"
Leslie Knope,Secretary.
Leslie Knope,She said I should call her and we can set something up next month.
Leslie Knope,It went really well with Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Next month, then."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Right, and I would love to speak to you about the ways we can improve our city."
Leslie Knope,I'm Marlene's daughter.
Leslie Knope,"No, but I am a big fan."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I want to win a Tellenson Award some day."
Leslie Knope,Janine?
Leslie Knope,They don't give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann, where's Mark?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and he's got three crutches."
Leslie Knope,Make any pancakes lately?
Leslie Knope,You just do everything your boyfriend tells you to do?
Leslie Knope,I don't think so.
Leslie Knope,You can't let yourself get taken advantage of.
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to bring the pain.
Leslie Knope,"But politics is different, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"You just go to work, and people come in, and you heal them."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Look, nursing is easy."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you don't understand politics."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just gonna get tough with her, Tellenson style."
Leslie Knope,That flu medicine really helped.
Leslie Knope,She's trying to cover up for the fact that she has a husband who likes to vroom vroom vroom vroom and glug glug glug glug glug.
Leslie Knope,I feel a thousand percent better.
Leslie Knope,Good as new.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna twist her arm a little bit.
Leslie Knope,Does this scarf look okay?
Leslie Knope,I don't want to look stuffy.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, apparently Restrepo was trying to blow us off, so my mom has a plan."
Leslie Knope,"I have a tough assignment, and I need his help with it."
Leslie Knope,Shoot!
Leslie Knope,"But I also don't want to look too ""schlubby""."
Leslie Knope,Moving and shaking.
Leslie Knope,I wish I could talk.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann."
Leslie Knope,But this time he made an exception.
Leslie Knope,Usually.
Leslie Knope,I went to Salvatore.
Leslie Knope,You like?
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm Marlene Griggs-Knope and I will destroy you all!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I think it would be a good idea to have a multi-use community park."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope from the Parks-- What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Madame Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should mention her massive weight loss.
Leslie Knope,"Brilliant political strategy, Mark."
Leslie Knope,She's right behind us and she could rezone our park.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to get me to talk to Janine Restrepo."
Leslie Knope,"If a bomb went off in here, it would definitely make the Indianapolis papers."
Leslie Knope,What a testament to my mother.
Leslie Knope,Another dynasty.
Leslie Knope,"That's his disappointing son, Theo."
Leslie Knope,Oscar Pfortmiller is dead.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Bert Winfield, Geoffrey Morglesberg, Quentin Arble, Dawn Krink, Michael Holloway, I don't know who that is, that's somebody's wife, Horace Rangel, Wilmer Vism and Oscar Pfortmiller."
Leslie Knope,At that table are all eight living Tellenson Award winners.
Leslie Knope,This is Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope,"So, I need your advice."
Leslie Knope,I'm seated near Janine Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,I think she could be very useful.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"And you, too, Janine."
Leslie Knope,"I love you, Mom."
Leslie Knope,And I am just so psyched that Janine Restrepo is here.
Leslie Knope,"In conclusion, my mom is Marlene Griggs-Knope."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the list includes such amazing people as zoning board member Janine Restrepo, and others."
Leslie Knope,There are so many luminaries here tonight.
Leslie Knope,Please save your applause until the end.
Leslie Knope,"And if you weren't thinking it, you probably already said it, ""political dynasty."""
Leslie Knope,"And together, we are the Knopes."
Leslie Knope,She's also my mother.
Leslie Knope,And one of them is you!
Leslie Knope,"Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom, but she's so much more than that."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,I'll make her feel like a human dinner roll.
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,My mom is crazy good at this.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, politics!"
Leslie Knope,The song's cut.
Leslie Knope,I could cut the song.
Leslie Knope,"It's 22 minutes long, with the song."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,What's my in?
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, Marlene's daughter."
Leslie Knope,This is so cool.
Leslie Knope,And the other two are crutches.
Leslie Knope,I think we're gonna meet a little earlier than what you said.
Leslie Knope,The answer is mine.
Leslie Knope,"And then, I took a third and it stayed down."
Leslie Knope,I'm getting better.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron, whose club do you think is better, yours or mine?"
Leslie Knope,You're burning up.
Leslie Knope,"We're called the Pawnee Goddesses, and we're freaking awesome."
Leslie Knope,So I did.
Leslie Knope,She couldn't.
Leslie Knope,"""Go start your own club."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is males only."""
Leslie Knope,"""No."""
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, a plucky fifthgrader wanted to join the Pawnee Rangers, but their executive council said what obnoxious jerks always say."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'll say.
Leslie Knope,And Ann gets the badge for second flyest hairstyle.
Leslie Knope,"To Abigail, flyest hairstyle."
Leslie Knope,"To Casey, the best penguin blog badge."
Leslie Knope,"No, I can't."
Leslie Knope,I can't go home.
Leslie Knope,I have to get ready for the Chamber of Secrets.
Leslie Knope,"If this meeting does not go perfectly, then the Harvest Festival is going to be over before it begins."
Leslie Knope,"Emily, you get the badge for most community service."
Leslie Knope,I cannot go home.
Leslie Knope,Say mine is better.
Leslie Knope,"Um, let's see."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, but it is."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my stars."
Leslie Knope,It's just I think it's a little chilly in here.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Whose club is better?
Leslie Knope,Give it up.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Say my club is better.
Leslie Knope,Say it's better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Say it's better.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,I am not sick.
Leslie Knope,My club is better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,"Say my club is better, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Well, my awesome goddesses don't want to be distracted by losers."
Leslie Knope,"My name is Annabelle Vandergraf, and, y'all, I just fall to pieces when the sun shines on my haired."
Leslie Knope,Who's Leslie?
Leslie Knope,My fragile constitution cannot handle the fearsome outdoors.
Leslie Knope,"I just have allergies, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I took a Claritin and I threw that up, so I took another one."
Leslie Knope,I threw that up.
Leslie Knope,I'm just a little lady.
Leslie Knope,Your club made it a competition when they kept girls out.
Leslie Knope,Ann's my doctor.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's time to give out the badges."
Leslie Knope,And she's the most beautiful nurse in the world.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to be able to pull it off.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I hope your husband gets help and that you have a long and happy marriage.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what came over me.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're too white.
Leslie Knope,How about a show tune or something?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No ""blah, blah, blah"", okay?"
Leslie Knope,Uh Just saying.
Leslie Knope,My mom told me.
Leslie Knope,Does he drive much out of state? I know that your husband is a drunk driver.
Leslie Knope,Your husband.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Now, get some rest."
Leslie Knope,I have some great news.
Leslie Knope,Drive much?
Leslie Knope,I know about things.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Not good enough.
Leslie Knope,How about Monday?
Leslie Knope,I think my fever just broke.
Leslie Knope,"No, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,I'll write you a rap.
Leslie Knope,Do you want me to write you a rap?
Leslie Knope,"So, let's talk about your opening remarks."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm hot."
Leslie Knope,"Now, it's really hot in here."
Leslie Knope,"If I was sick, could I do this?"
Leslie Knope,Cartwheels.
Leslie Knope,Am I not doing them?
Leslie Knope,It's not that I don't trust Ben.
Leslie Knope,It's that I don't have faith in Ben.
Leslie Knope,"And, also, I'm starting to forget who Ben is."
Leslie Knope,Fondly.
Leslie Knope,"That's why everybody calls her ""The Iron [bleep] of Pawnee."""
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, former Councilman Schnable."
Leslie Knope,She's one tough cookie.
Leslie Knope,"He lives in Florida, in a cemetery."
Leslie Knope,"But my dad never won an award, and he was always happy."
Leslie Knope,Would I like to win a Tellenson Award like my mom did? Sure.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I think Ann and I are really good people, and someday others will see that and we'll get our due."
Leslie Knope,The people who win awards aren't always the best people.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"I tried, but I just couldn't do it."
Leslie Knope,"I just wanted to tell you that I didn't go through with it, blackmailing that woman."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, my mom is alive and I love her."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, what a night!"
Leslie Knope,We need to rezone the pit to turn it into a park and she's on the zoning board.
Leslie Knope,I always have.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,But you can choose where you live.
Leslie Knope,The point is you can't choose where you were born.
Leslie Knope,"And everybody called you ""the gerbil"" because you always smelled like soiled wood chips?"
Leslie Knope,"You stuck your underwear in your drawer, and you got really embarrassed, and then the teacher came over and pulled them out."
Leslie Knope,Do you remember when you peed your pants in second grade
Leslie Knope,"Jim and I have gone to school together since we were, like, three years old."
Leslie Knope,I know Jim.
Leslie Knope,Jim Kabernick.
Leslie Knope,"And, Jim."
Leslie Knope,Especially when it's wet.
Leslie Knope,It gets very slippery there.
Leslie Knope,"You know, ""nipple hill""."
Leslie Knope,Sledding on that giant hill behind Kernston's rubber nipple factory.
Leslie Knope,"When I was nine years old, I broke my arm."
Leslie Knope,It's where you're from.
Leslie Knope,It's not where you're born.
Leslie Knope,"I learned something, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"I thought I was telling the truth, but, sadly, I was born in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Every one of you, just by showing up here tonight, has already made history."
Leslie Knope,"In days past, the Harvest Festival was the cornerstone of Pawnee's smallbusiness community, a weeklong showcase for everything from textiles to small farms."
Leslie Knope,I'd like to apologize to those that I've misled.
Leslie Knope,I always will.
Leslie Knope,"By our estimates, as many as 30,000 people might attend the festival, and the monetary value of that kind of direct customer-to-business exposure is, frankly, incalculable."
Leslie Knope,And that's why I wrote a book about it.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm not crazy."
Leslie Knope,Today is a great day for the Knope family.
Leslie Knope,"And that's the great thing about Indians, back then, is, they used every part of the pioneer."
Leslie Knope,And they made his legs into rain sticks.
Leslie Knope,And they made it into a dream catcher.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this ain't your call, McCluskey."
Leslie Knope,They cut his face off.
Leslie Knope,"He was a pioneer who was killed by a tribe of Wamapoke Indians, after he traded them a baby for what is now Indianapolis."
Leslie Knope,"This wooded area is the site of, um, the murder, actually, of Nathaniel Bixby Mark."
Leslie Knope,"In a town as old as Pawnee, there's a lot of history in every acre."
Leslie Knope,He just seemed so happy.
Leslie Knope,Godspeed.
Leslie Knope,You're doing great.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Although I could do without this.
Leslie Knope,Joan put us in her book club.
Leslie Knope,Why can't it be here?
Leslie Knope,"Somewhere, those waffles exist."
Leslie Knope,"So delicious, and rich, and golden brown that anyone who tasted them would decide never to leave that town."
Leslie Knope,"And, yes, every town claims its diner's waffles are the best in the world, but somewhere, in some town, there really are the best waffles in the world."
Leslie Knope,And serving the goofballs in this town is an honor and a privilege.
Leslie Knope,And work.
Leslie Knope,But it's a great place to live.
Leslie Knope,"I know Pawnee isn't Paris, or London, or Chicago."
Leslie Knope,And that's why I'm running for City Council.
Leslie Knope,The time is now.
Leslie Knope,The place is Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"If I come clean about where I'm from, then my political career is over."
Leslie Knope,I could write a second book about Eagleton and how stupid it is.
Leslie Knope,There's a whole chapter about it in my book.
Leslie Knope,"Eagleton is the land of rich, snobby jerks."
Leslie Knope,Don't make me go to Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,Let's make history.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,I liked the stuff you said about Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Here's my birth certificate.
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, I can end this now."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,13% believe I'm crazy eyed? What? Why?
Leslie Knope,Any questions? Yes sir?
Leslie Knope,"That's a very good question, sir, and I would counter with my own question, which is, why is half of your face all swirly?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm from here!
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous!
Leslie Knope,I am back from where I came from!
Leslie Knope,"Give it up, everybody, for Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't carry my birth certificate around with me"
Leslie Knope,"And I'd call it Eagleton: The land of rich, snobby jerks."
Leslie Knope,"Take it down a notch, Alexis."
Leslie Knope,I need a copy of my birth certificate.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,The sticker is the least of my problems.
Leslie Knope,"Voldemort, probably."
Leslie Knope,I wonder who else was born in Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm an Eagletonian.
Leslie Knope,I'm worse than a liar.
Leslie Knope,I'm the liar.
Leslie Knope,"I went on Pawnee today, and I called Joan a liar!"
Leslie Knope,I wrote on the cover of my book that I was born in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,The people of Pawnee care.
Leslie Knope,I care.
Leslie Knope,My mother is being honored at a banquet with the Tellenson Award for Excellence in Pawnee Public Service.
Leslie Knope,"Mom, why didn't you tell me?"
Leslie Knope,Was I born in Eagleton?
Leslie Knope,Is it true mom?
Leslie Knope,I'm from Eagleton!
Leslie Knope,"Leslie Barbara Knope, born January 18th, to Robert and Marlene Knope, in Eagleton, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Nice!
Leslie Knope,Andy
Leslie Knope,I need that birth certificate.
Leslie Knope,"I hate this stupid town with all its stupid, terrible people."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"The award's named after the legendary Tony Tellenson, who was a great man."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, is a great man."
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am glad that they're keeping him alive."
Leslie Knope,"Pin it up, something sassy, but powerful and dynastic."
Leslie Knope,"And I just wanted to mix things up a little bit, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"So, in a way, I am also being honored."
Leslie Knope,"Well, my mom is being honored tonight."
Leslie Knope,Would you call being her daughter related?
Leslie Knope,That depends.
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation."
Leslie Knope,This is my first official political haircut.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, no."
Leslie Knope,Classic Salvatore!
Leslie Knope,"So, what's the inside scoop, Salvatore?"
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt!
Leslie Knope,Hello!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's the guy that made Larry Bird look the way he does."
Leslie Knope,All the movers and shakers who come through Pawnee have sat in that chair at one point or another.
Leslie Knope,Good to see you.
Leslie Knope,Salvatore Manfrelotti has been cutting hair across from Pioneer Hall since 1958.
Leslie Knope,I'm headed to the salon right now.
Leslie Knope,"Can I get some money for the cab that I took over here, please?"
Leslie Knope,The Tellensons is like the Oscars times the Grammys plus the Super Bowl.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It is the most exclusive local government event of the year.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April."
Leslie Knope,"I'm off the clock, April."
Leslie Knope,You don't need to call me sir.
Leslie Knope,"Salvatore calls this hairdo ""The Mayor."""
Leslie Knope,Seated behind us is Janine Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I said don't look."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, don't look."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I was going for wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Can I get a ""what what?"""
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Table 12."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go."
Leslie Knope,I am the daughter of the honoree this evening.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I looked at the meter, and it had Egyptian hieroglyphics on it."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, former City Councilman."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Rarified air!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we are in rarified air tonight, Ann."
Leslie Knope,That's former City Councilman Frank Schnable.
Leslie Knope,You want a drink?
Leslie Knope,Everyone's looking at us.
Leslie Knope,We look great.
Leslie Knope,You look great.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,"And yes, I will wear my hair like this when I am the first female mayor of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Be cool, be cool!"
Leslie Knope,"No, we do."
Leslie Knope,Do you know the exchange rate?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"I never said ""obese."""
Leslie Knope,What's the first sentence again?
Leslie Knope,"Um, all right, let's start from the top."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I've lost my momentum now."
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't say ""learning disabled."""
Leslie Knope,Read that part back to me.
Leslie Knope,It was a great learning experience because my mom casts a long shadow.
Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was in the Smithsonian.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it didn't answer your call?"
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, ask the Gettysburg Address."
Leslie Knope,How important are speeches?
Leslie Knope,Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mother.
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, I'm ready."
Leslie Knope,Get up there and introduce me.
Leslie Knope,"We are gonna meet some powerful people tonight, so take this down."
Leslie Knope,This is a big night.
Leslie Knope,This is very exciting.
Leslie Knope,I mean no disrespect.
Leslie Knope,Minus the drinking problem.
Leslie Knope,"Like the Kennedys, or the Bushes."
Leslie Knope,"But I think we could be a multigenerational political dynasty, you and I, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I already know, the one on the left where the American flag is."
Leslie Knope,"I said ""is my mother."""
Leslie Knope,"I need to mention the park and in a very subtle way, I need to let people know that I'm forging my own path and I have my own subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to sound braggy.
Leslie Knope,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,So should we do this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,Be careful.
Leslie Knope,The floor and the wall just switched.
Leslie Knope,Walk very carefully.
Leslie Knope,"It's not that I don't trust you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,To the max.
Leslie Knope,It's just this Harvest Festival is my project.
Leslie Knope,And I just need to make sure that I've done everything I can to make it work.
Leslie Knope,"""I am the Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and to be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's show time.
Leslie Knope,"So, I start off with, ""I am Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"Good evening, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Monster.
Leslie Knope,And this is Nightline.
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,It's my career on the line.
Leslie Knope,Mine.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,You know it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, they figure if people criticize them, it'll seem like they're attacking something very reasonable."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I loved it. Felt like a tiny king."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, I'm going to miss you, enormous chair."
Leslie Knope,"It says they've got turkey sandwiches, and the nectar of a thousand sorrows."
Leslie Knope,"Also, light refreshments will be served."
Leslie Knope,The giant lizard God who will destoy the Earth with his cleansing fire of judgment.
Leslie Knope,"Tonight the follower of Reasonablism, will be joining together to await the return of Zorp."
Leslie Knope,"Turns out when you think the world's ending, you don't aim so carefully in the portapotties."
Leslie Knope,It's super annoying.
Leslie Knope,And they have an all-night vigil in the park.
Leslie Knope,And every few years the remaining members predicted the world's gonna end.
Leslie Knope,"For a while in the 1970s, our town was run by a freaky cult."
Leslie Knope,"Not giving me much notice Herb, let me see what I can do."
Leslie Knope,You sure it's tomorrow?
Leslie Knope,Aw nuts.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Herb, what can I do you for?"
Leslie Knope,"Again, Andy, you don't need to bow."
Leslie Knope,"And when I die, I'm gonna project it on my tombstone."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna watch it every day for the rest of my life.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I loved it."
Leslie Knope,Tom won't be down for long.
Leslie Knope,"It was Mary Pickford who once said, ""This thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down."""
Leslie Knope,"Look, there's nothing to worry about, they've said that the world is going to end 15 times."
Leslie Knope,"But hey, you know, whatever works."
Leslie Knope,And the only bad thing that's ever happened on any of those dates is Lance Armstrong dumping Sheryl Crow.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you think I should have the money?
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,And it turned out great and everyone loved it.
Leslie Knope,He's actually dating Jerry's daughter.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,I think Ice Town sounds great.
Leslie Knope,"And the point is, at least you tried something."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Chris?
Leslie Knope,"Right, okay let's go with the first one."
Leslie Knope,"""Doomsday prediction falls flat as citizens spend pleasant evening enjoying one of Pawnee's finest parks."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, ""Zorp Shmorp!"""
Leslie Knope,"""It's the end of the world as they know it, but Pawnee feels fine."""
Leslie Knope,Headline idea.
Leslie Knope,We're in good company.
Leslie Knope,"Obama and Madonna, probably."
Leslie Knope,Jerry and April.
Leslie Knope,"Big deal, lots of people don't hang out."
Leslie Knope,Ben and I don't hang out much these days.
Leslie Knope,Definitely get it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmhmm, totally get it."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it looks like we're kind of forced to hang out with each other."
Leslie Knope,I think he technically might have bribed him.
Leslie Knope,He went to Kernston's office and basically begged him to meet with me again.
Leslie Knope,"Tom Haverford is a selfish, unctuous, sleazy, self-promoting, good-hearted, secretly kind and wonderful tiny little person."
Leslie Knope,Look at me.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to see your face.
Leslie Knope,Look at me!
Leslie Knope,You didn't even let me have my one night.
Leslie Knope,Just because you want something doesn't mean that everybody has to bow to listen to me!
Leslie Knope,"You're a selfish little punk, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You know what you are?
Leslie Knope,Listen to me.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, then I'm getting in."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, get out of your stupid limousine hot tub right now, or we are no longer friends."
Leslie Knope,Get out of there right now.
Leslie Knope,"There you are, you little bastard."
Leslie Knope,I just want to apologize for the actions of that little weasel.
Leslie Knope,"Um, Mr. President."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, we're not gonna waste any more of your time."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, um I know that video seemed like the rantings of a lunatic pretending to be Mark zuckerberg"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You're lucky that Martin Kernston is here because you're gonna need another nipple.
Leslie Knope,Turn that off or give me the remote right now.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, listen to me."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Jeff's Savings and Loan
Leslie Knope,I don't want to see your face!
Leslie Knope,I've been looking at your face all night.
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,Ma'am?
Leslie Knope,Didn't I ask for whipped cream on this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's eat and go."
Leslie Knope,Of my life?
Leslie Knope,You're gonna have a lot more good ideas.
Leslie Knope,Occasionally.
Leslie Knope,And charming.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Tom, you're a smart guy."
Leslie Knope,It's gibberish.
Leslie Knope,It doesn't make any sense.
Leslie Knope,"Also, your logo, it's the worst logo I've ever seen."
Leslie Knope,But enough about how cute it was.
Leslie Knope,Kind of seems like regular sight should have caught that one.
Leslie Knope,And you said you were all booked up.
Leslie Knope,I remember trying to hire you once.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I thought you guys were doing great."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Some good oldfashioned comfort food.
Leslie Knope,You know what you need?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"With the company, Tom."
Leslie Knope,What happened?
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe we should get out of this hot tub."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard."
Leslie Knope,It was so cute.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, I married two penguins at the zoo, and it turned out they were both gay."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am."
Leslie Knope,I'm great at being sneaky.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958."
Leslie Knope,"Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman."
Leslie Knope,"I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M."
Leslie Knope,This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.
Leslie Knope,"No, this is a great gas station."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"Well, here we are."
Leslie Knope,We're at the special place!
Leslie Knope,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,"Just out of curiosity, where's your favorite place to go like ever?"
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,She's been there before.
Leslie Knope,"No spoilers, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the thing that I told you about with Ben.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"It's, uh, it's something that we need to get in my car and go to, so let's do that."
Leslie Knope,It's going to freak you out.
Leslie Knope,I need to bring you there right now it's so amazing.
Leslie Knope,I forgot I have a thing I need to show you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,They probably just want to see each other naked.
Leslie Knope,They're both so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,I had nothing to do with this date.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,Jurassic Park.
Leslie Knope,Parks are so great.
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department needs money.
Leslie Knope,I just did it in three moves.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Chris and Ann, what are you two doing here?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, but I'll stay for just one drink."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"But I have to tell you, Ron If the world was ending tomorrow, I'd want to be with him."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we broke up because of me."
Leslie Knope,I okay.
Leslie Knope,I tried to screw up even the potential of Ben dating someone else.
Leslie Knope,Can I speak with you about a personal matter?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"I am so happy I ran into you, because I wanted to speak to you about--"
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,What would you do if the world was really going to end?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm showing you a part of Rock and Roll history.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I just knew you were a big fan of financial records, so, you're welcome."
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,I lost my mind tonight.
Leslie Knope,Smooth Operator Bikini Waxes.
Leslie Knope,"It's half chess, half risk and takes like 15 hours to play."
Leslie Knope,You know what would be really fun?
Leslie Knope,They're gonna have sex in five minutes.
Leslie Knope,My God.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so just because I can't go out with him, someone else can?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, if you say yes, I will kick, I swear to God."
Leslie Knope,Is she more charming than me?
Leslie Knope,He's smiling and she's being very charming.
Leslie Knope,"What's that, what do you mean just talking?"
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so annoyed that he would hypothetically do that."
Leslie Knope,Or he's going to be really progressive and change his name to Ben Wyatt-Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"She smiles, and then they fall in love, and then they get married, and then she changes her name to Shauna Malwae-Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,I know how Shauna operates.
Leslie Knope,"Oh boy, I know how this goes."
Leslie Knope,The world is ending.
Leslie Knope,Happy to help.
Leslie Knope,By Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,The end.
Leslie Knope,"And he is, we've never discussed sex, so. It's... we've always just been very business-like, so... Your guess is as good nay, better than mine."
Leslie Knope,"He's, um, a man and he's a worker."
Leslie Knope,I'm not I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sort of a gay hero.
Leslie Knope,I've gotta stop this.
Leslie Knope,I've got to keep them away from each other for the rest of their lives.
Leslie Knope,Unclear!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,"After dinner, we should take a walk by the pond in Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, too bad the park's always closed, though."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to play a fun game with me that I made up called chessrisk?
Leslie Knope,Where you headed off to?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, where you going?"
Leslie Knope,What an unbelievably unpleasant person.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You want to be here for that.
Leslie Knope,"Boy, would your face be red."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what if you're not here when Zorp shows up?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,Because you can't go.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's where all the losers are going."
Leslie Knope,"Or, um, walk away from here?"
Leslie Knope,Do you want to go buy some more pants?
Leslie Knope,Where'd you get them?
Leslie Knope,I really like your pants.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, those are really nice pants."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, keep your pants on, girl!"
Leslie Knope,Keep your pants on.
Leslie Knope,So boring.
Leslie Knope,Ben hasn't bored you to death by now.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you two are still talking?"
Leslie Knope,"Hur Well, then you should stay here then."
Leslie Knope,"No matter what you heard, ma'am, the truth is, I was born here."
Leslie Knope,Sue's Salads.
Leslie Knope,"Food and Stuff, JJ's Diner, Glenmore Discount Cemetery, uh, Tramp Stamp Tattoos, Enormous Kenny's Fried Dough Stand and Mobile Phone Emporium."
Leslie Knope,Our topic today?
Leslie Knope,"Look, we're not just pencil pushers."
Leslie Knope,We are a reflection of the community.
Leslie Knope,And we believe that we can strengthen that community.
Leslie Knope,"Because in the end, the reason why we're all here is to bring people together."
Leslie Knope,Excellent! Great! Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, we're going to party hard for 15 minutes and then, we're going to have our first brainstorming session."
Leslie Knope,"So, JJ, we wanted to talk to you about the Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, I haven't been feeling myself."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to wonder weekend's firstever public forum.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm organizing this huge Harvest Festival and I need at least 80 local businesses to participate."
Leslie Knope,And normally this is the kind of thing I would love to do.
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone."
Leslie Knope,70 30.
Leslie Knope,But mostly proud.
Leslie Knope,And a little annoyed.
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud.
Leslie Knope,"But, I'm just feeling really tired."
Leslie Knope,I've created a mob of little Leslie Knope monsters.
Leslie Knope,I've taught them too well.
Leslie Knope,"I said, ""great idea, Lauren."""
Leslie Knope,"Great idea, Lauren."
Leslie Knope,We just struck a huge blow for equality by proving that we were better than them.
Leslie Knope,"Should the amazing goddesses take pity on the once powerful Pawnee Rangers, and let them into our clearly superior organization?"
Leslie Knope,I think maybe my allergies are acting up.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your opening statement."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I have a lot of respect for the Pawnee Rangers, even if they were jerks five years ago."
Leslie Knope,"Can I sit down? Look, I didn't mean for this to happen."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! Now, have yourselves a puppy party."
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, you are now goddesses."
Leslie Knope,"Enemies of fairness and equality, hear my womanly roar."
Leslie Knope,Queen of all that I survey.
Leslie Knope,A glorious female warrior.
Leslie Knope,I am a goddess.
Leslie Knope,Those puppies?
Leslie Knope,The puppies for the puppy party that we're having in our cabin?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,We have amazing candy in there.
Leslie Knope,"The goddesses are making some well informed statements, but the most compelling point is from Darren, about the candy."
Leslie Knope,Darren?
Leslie Knope,Anyone?
Leslie Knope,Let's hear from a ranger.
Leslie Knope,I see where you're coming from.
Leslie Knope,Casey?
Leslie Knope,"Mmm, interesting."
Leslie Knope,"Who yes, Abigail."
Leslie Knope,Let's open up the floor to debate.
Leslie Knope,Powerful stuff.
Leslie Knope,"I've already vomited, like, five times today."
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting tonight at the Chamber of Commerce and we're going to go over all the details.
Leslie Knope,And we'd just love if you could come and join us.
Leslie Knope,It's just allergies.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,Just let me in there.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,You look tired and you're all sweaty all the time.
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?
Leslie Knope,"You want to go there, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'm coming in."
Leslie Knope,And that's important.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, come on."
Leslie Knope,Just let me in.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ann's keeping us warm."
Leslie Knope,I'm not going home.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,I really wouldn't want to follow that.
Leslie Knope,"Lauren, that's so good!"
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Leslie Knope,Lauren?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so what did everybody make for their loosely structured craft time?"
Leslie Knope,This year's cabin refurbishment badge is going to be hotly contested.
Leslie Knope,The goddess cabin has never looked better.
Leslie Knope,Ladies!
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sick.
Leslie Knope,What was your craft?
Leslie Knope,"This homemade bulgogi is so delicious, Kayla."
Leslie Knope,This is the best Korean food I've ever had.
Leslie Knope,I bet you say that to all the girls.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, goddesses."
Leslie Knope,"In a sense, but it's a little bit more complicated than"
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, I just wanted to thank you for not cheering when I sent Darren away."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Darren."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you should start your own club, for boys."
Leslie Knope,"Well, see, the thing is this club is for girls only."
Leslie Knope,"I secretly always wanted this badge, so it works out great."
Leslie Knope,"I would give myself a merit badge that says ""Best Club Founder,"" but I don't have one, so I'm going to give myself ""Prettiest eyes"" as a placeholder."
Leslie Knope,My club is officially the best club.
Leslie Knope,I did it!
Leslie Knope,You're not a jerk.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, what is it?"
Leslie Knope,And the silver pillow goes to Janie.
Leslie Knope,Lulu gets the golden pillow.
Leslie Knope,Now it's time for awards.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,That was one of our best ones yet.
Leslie Knope,"Great pillow fight, girls."
Leslie Knope,"We have hiking, and then capture the flag, and then a puppet show about the Bill of Rights set to ""Party in the USA"" by Miley Cyrus, and then we have lasso training, and a s'moresoff."
Leslie Knope,"Goddesses, let's go over our schedule for this afternoon."
Leslie Knope,"Right, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,I would say it's almost as good as lukewarm beans from a can.
Leslie Knope,"So, we've developed a revenue sharing formula that will hopefully appeal to most business owners, but--"
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,You're a good troop leader.
Leslie Knope,That's not true.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you eliminate the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just especially thankful that you could come, Mr. President."
Leslie Knope,"When in doubt, in Pawnee, slam salad."
Leslie Knope,"Despite the fact that this seems like a party for Tom's face, uh, I think it's going pretty well."
Leslie Knope,And I think I have a lot of support in the community for that.
Leslie Knope,"I know I should be chasing your vote, but I stand behind my decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"That's 'cause I don't hate myself, Tanya."
Leslie Knope,"Although I've not worked with you professionally, as a private citizen, I have personally patronized each and every one of your establishments."
Leslie Knope,Just scrape off the words.
Leslie Knope,Keep that cake here.
Leslie Knope,Except that cake.
Leslie Knope,"I want all of this gone, all of it."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, now is not a time for you to explore your weird dreams."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then shouldn't my face be on these rugs?"
Leslie Knope,Is Entertainment 720 running for office?
Leslie Knope,We're barely able to function.
Leslie Knope,We could really use that money.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,Mission accomplished.
Leslie Knope,Let's boogie.
Leslie Knope,Yeah. There's a mission that Ann had thought of.
Leslie Knope,Martin.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Well It was a team effort.
Leslie Knope,So many business represented here today.
Leslie Knope,You are a giant in this community.
Leslie Knope,"And I'm not referring to your stature, Gary."
Leslie Knope,"And what has kept our town alive is you, the small businessman."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has suffered through a tough economy.
Leslie Knope,"I don't need your ""help"" anymore."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go over to one of your rugs and sit on your own face?
Leslie Knope,I have a better idea.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks a lot, traitor."
Leslie Knope,You stole the nipple king.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"It was both of our ideas, but it was mostly Ann's."
Leslie Knope,But I can say without hesitation that Tom is being a real dick.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't like to throw around the word ""butthead"" too often."
Leslie Knope,No one says that.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, tell Martin how hard I worked on the Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, come over here and talk about how great I am."
Leslie Knope,Bureaucrats s aren't used to bragging about themselves.
Leslie Knope,I'm just.
Leslie Knope,I worked very hard on that event.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,They succeeded despite me.
Leslie Knope,I held them back actually.
Leslie Knope,I barely did anything.
Leslie Knope,"If you call everybody a butthead, then it kind of loses its impact."
Leslie Knope,Who else?
Leslie Knope,We I had mentioned to Ann that it would be fun if you two went on a date.
Leslie Knope,Budget solution number 28.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm on it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it depends, Flirtman is more of a confidant"
Leslie Knope,I know a little bit about him.
Leslie Knope,I've heard of Martin Kernston.
Leslie Knope,"""The nipple king."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, from Kernston Rubber Nipples."
Leslie Knope,"And while they were here, they would also attend the Festival, a full week of corn mazes, hay rides, Ferris wheels, pumpkins the size ofjeeps."
Leslie Knope,I'm not going to use that.
Leslie Knope,"Here's my opening line: ""Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, and I'm in the business of being city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"So I'm throwing a little meet and greet with business owners, and I've asked Tom's company to help."
Leslie Knope,"When you work in government, people often suspect that you're anti-business."
Leslie Knope,I hate talking about myself.
Leslie Knope,Boys and girls welcome.
Leslie Knope,"We lost that festival a few years ago, due to another round of budget cuts."
Leslie Knope,And I propose we bring the festival back.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee's most hardcore outdoor club starts today.
Leslie Knope,"Do you find video games pointless and shopping malls stupid? Do you march to the beat of your own drummer? Did you make the drum yourself? If so, you might just have what it takes to be a Swanson."
Leslie Knope,Are you tough as nails? Would you rather sleep on a bed of pine needles than a mattress?
Leslie Knope,"With ticket sales and corporate sponsorship, we'll earn all that money back."
Leslie Knope,"And believe me, people will come."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on! We need you to help us have fun!"
Leslie Knope,"Come on! Come do that thing where you catch one with your hands! I've seen him do it, it's incredible."
Leslie Knope,Ron! Come fish with us!
Leslie Knope,Allergic to chestnuts.
Leslie Knope,People from all over Indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizens were.
Leslie Knope,"Widespread obesity, and the annual Pawnee Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,This town was historically known for two things.
Leslie Knope,Use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks.
Leslie Knope,Note.
Leslie Knope,Tired sheep could become food or sweaters.
Leslie Knope,"Okay. Well, when your back's against the wall and odds are stacked against you, you just... You... You swing the hardest, damn it."
Leslie Knope,You go big or you go home.
Leslie Knope,This looks like a party for Entertainment 720.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this is not what I pictured at all."
Leslie Knope,And you don't seem like the kind of guy who goes home.
Leslie Knope,"Go get her, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, we know the people who run this government have no faith in us."
Leslie Knope,"So, then, you could talk about the money, and then, you know, maybe give it to me."
Leslie Knope,My plan is going to change that and bring the budget back.
Leslie Knope,No. Not that.
Leslie Knope,Although that is very good advice.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Leslie Knope,"Looking at you, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What's going to save us is right there.
Leslie Knope,"Gentlemen, I realize that times are tough and the budget is tight."
Leslie Knope,And good haircuts.
Leslie Knope,"But if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their houses and play video games, then Pawnee will die."
Leslie Knope,And we refuse to let that happen.
Leslie Knope,Now.
Leslie Knope,And the answer's been right in front of us the whole time.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,That's the county Pawnee is in.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Oh no.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, President, Reagan, my blazer popped open."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, we're being very careful."
Leslie Knope,Please tell me you hung up before Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, lay down."
Leslie Knope,And this is how Eleanor Roosevelt would kiss.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,How did you find out?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,Who do I call?
Leslie Knope,This is an outrage!
Leslie Knope,Check and mate.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you're trying to throw me off.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you are.
Leslie Knope,"And how How do I know, frankly, that you're not sleeping with him?"
Leslie Knope,"And he is terrible, facewise."
Leslie Knope,"It's none of your You have the nerve, the audacity Ben is my boss, technically."
Leslie Knope,I don't even get Why would I I've never had sex with anyone anywhere.
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting and wrong.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you've proven your point."
Leslie Knope,"So the only people that know are my mom, Ann, and Ron."
Leslie Knope,And they're not gonna say anything.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome, everyone."
Leslie Knope,And thank you for your discretion.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,Two time capsules.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"I have a gift certificate actually, my mom gave it to me for you."
Leslie Knope,"One that totally encapsulates what's happening right now in Pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that's just for items of personal significance, like Twilight."
Leslie Knope,You should do that and you should get a massage.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,And about how much he hurt you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I won the MacArthur Genius Grant.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, right."
Leslie Knope,What you saw was not what you think it is.
Leslie Knope,Hey friend.
Leslie Knope,"So my mom, Ron, Ann, and that guy."
Leslie Knope,You can just leave it there.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, I think we can get away with that as long as we don't do stuff like this."
Leslie Knope,That feels appropriate.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,We can't.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Sebastian may have been li'I, but his impact on this town and the Parks Department was anything but li'I."
Leslie Knope,"Every time I hear his name, I think about the fact that he's gonna find out about me and Ben, and he's gonna fire both of us."
Leslie Knope,How's Ann?
Leslie Knope,"It's times like this, when someone or some horse passes, that you really take stock of your life."
Leslie Knope,"I got it, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"But for now, I think we should bow our heads in a moment of silence."
Leslie Knope,"Because of all he's done for the town, we are gonna be holding a small memorial service for him."
Leslie Knope,Eating carrots and urinating freely.
Leslie Knope,"But we can take comfort in the fact that he is in heaven now, doing the two things he loves doing the most."
Leslie Knope,He died last night.
Leslie Knope,"For the last time, and I won't say this again, there will be no human or feline ashes in either one of the time capsules."
Leslie Knope,No chanting.
Leslie Knope,So what's your suggestion?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think pet paintings/ ashes are in time capsule four."
Leslie Knope,"I have some very important news about our favorite minihorse, Li'I Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,"I can help you in here, sir."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Swivel, swivel, swivel."
Leslie Knope,Citizen request.
Leslie Knope,How long do you have to do this?
Leslie Knope,Seems like everyone else is back to normal.
Leslie Knope,"No, baseball cards are in time capsule nine, childhood memorabilia."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a 10-minute break! Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Kind of figured you'd be back in your office by now.
Leslie Knope,You look around you and you start to realize what it is that you truly care about.
Leslie Knope,"For Li'l Sebastian, I imagine it was good fresh oats, a trough of water, and a willing sexual partner."
Leslie Knope,Or non-willing.
Leslie Knope,"He was a horse, so I think they had to do it either way."
Leslie Knope,But enough about me.
Leslie Knope,"I mean we have to sleep around, but weirdly it's kind of fun that no one knows."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, I don't know, when I look at my life right now, it feels almost perfect."
Leslie Knope,Sophisticated with a hint of slutty.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I'm meeting him in your office in a few minutes, how do I look?"
Leslie Knope,Make us proud.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, we trust you."
Leslie Knope,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Leslie Knope,Must be a typo.
Leslie Knope,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,Don't even talk about Chris.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here is a memo with some facts about Li'I Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,We can give him 50 bucks.
Leslie Knope,"He sleeps on a futon, so"
Leslie Knope,"Something like Candle in the Wind, but 5,000 times better."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, I need you to write a memorial song."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jerry, that sounds wonderful."
Leslie Knope,Ron will be laying the ceremonial wreath.
Leslie Knope,So maintenance is gonna set up the stage.
Leslie Knope,That's what he would've wanted.
Leslie Knope,"From now on, we stop mourning Li'l Sebastian's death and we start celebrating his life."
Leslie Knope,I think you'll find yours particularly interesting.
Leslie Knope,"I would like to introduce his owner's, Michael and Elizabeth Stone, and two of his closest friends."
Leslie Knope,"Not only was Coconut a friend, but she was also a lover."
Leslie Knope,Our deepest sympathy is with you.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Two people for Twilight.
Leslie Knope,Very sorry that I just used that word.
Leslie Knope,Absotootly I am.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Would I have to quit my job?
Leslie Knope,I just I've dreamed about this moment for a long time.
Leslie Knope,But yes.
Leslie Knope,Very sorry that I just used that word.
Leslie Knope,"Absotootly, I am."
Leslie Knope,Which office in particular?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, a lot of people contributed to that."
Leslie Knope,'Cause it was planned.
Leslie Knope,I'm glad.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,They want me to run for office.
Leslie Knope,"I know, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yea.
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,So did you get a chance to look at my sample position papers?
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I saw her in the courtyard."
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"So, we have one very moving case for Twilight."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"Ron, hey!"
Leslie Knope,Just one second.
Leslie Knope,Yea.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, please."
Leslie Knope,I think it's gonna be really bad.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Yea!
Leslie Knope,Yea!
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,But it's worth the risk if I can be with you.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay, we're--"
Leslie Knope,This is sort of a mess.
Leslie Knope,Because Donna's reading Jerry's Italian poem.
Leslie Knope,"Because Joe from sewage had to hand out the armbands, and Perd had to fill in for Mortenson, and Mortenson had to fill in for Howser."
Leslie Knope,Do you see the irony here?
Leslie Knope,Andy Dwyer.
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,"Next, we have a special musical tribute by Mr."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"All the proceeds will go towards Li'I Sebastian's favorite charity, the Afghan Institute of Learning."
Leslie Knope,Because you are doing something better.
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Donna, why don't you put a question mark next to Twilight?"
Leslie Knope,"What everyone wants, what Li'I Sebastian wants, is for you to get propane."
Leslie Knope,"No one wants you to read a poem, okay, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need you to go get some propane."
Leslie Knope,I'll deal with it.
Leslie Knope,Start the video presentation.
Leslie Knope,What a Okay.
Leslie Knope,And who else?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think if we're gonna be adding a book to the time capsule, it would probably be Twilight."
Leslie Knope,That guy left?
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,We'd like to encourage everyone to buy our merchandise.
Leslie Knope,This time capsule's tearing this town apart.
Leslie Knope,"You are lighting the memorial flame, which is the greatest honor of all."
Leslie Knope,"A very nosy maintenance worker, and we talked to him, and now we're all friends, and he's not gonna tell on us."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, when we're at work, we just shouldn't talk to each other at all."
Leslie Knope,No more smooching in Ann's office.
Leslie Knope,No more secret handholding.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, operation shutdown."
Leslie Knope,I like my job.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, now we have two people for Twilight."
Leslie Knope,"So too Christian, and not Christian enough?"
Leslie Knope,I like you.
Leslie Knope,"I saved it for you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"This thing that we're doing, it's unsustainable."
Leslie Knope,And we burned it off.
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson loves his facial hair.
Leslie Knope,We planned that.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, wow!"
Leslie Knope,We planned that!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry, you put propane in the eternal flame, right?"
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,You're leaving soon.
Leslie Knope,You keep your hands off him.
Leslie Knope,Can I blame it on you in the press?
Leslie Knope,Nice.
Leslie Knope,But I've never met her.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Ben, these guys are cops, not ballerinas."
Leslie Knope,So we are throwing a little shindig for the police department because we're asking them to volunteer as security during the Harvest Festival.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know what it is about big outdoor gatherings that makes everyone want to urinate all over everything, but it does."
Leslie Knope,And they do.
Leslie Knope,Calzones are like pizzas but they're harder to eat.
Leslie Knope,"They're dumb, and so was that idea."
Leslie Knope,We laugh about it.
Leslie Knope,We get it all the time.
Leslie Knope,Just a coincidence.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you tonight.
Leslie Knope,"I just don't wanna talk about it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Just white wine, cuddling, and crazy amounts of History Channel documentaries."
Leslie Knope,"No problems, no fights."
Leslie Knope,The best part of any relationship is the beginning.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call."
Leslie Knope,"Conference room ""C""."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so we're ordering them a total of 30 pizzas, so let's talk toppings."
Leslie Knope,Good Good day.
Leslie Knope,She's Filipino.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Go in there, you're gonna be great."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, she's amazing."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,And she's kind of a bully.
Leslie Knope,"Just to let you know, I gave the senior center project to Donna."
Leslie Knope,"Also, she can be cruel and difficult, and she makes snap judgments about people that she holds on to for a very long time."
Leslie Knope,Nothing much.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ben."
Leslie Knope,That guy was rude.
Leslie Knope,Stuart.
Leslie Knope,"Stuart, please, could you give us, like, 45 minutes?"
Leslie Knope,Everybody wins.
Leslie Knope,"And that way, Ben never has to meet her and I could visit her in London."
Leslie Knope,"I should get my mother a oneway ticket to London, leaving today."
Leslie Knope,You know what I should do?
Leslie Knope,"Because Ben and I are in this amazing little bubble right now, and there's no room in here for Chris' stupid rules about us not dating or my ballbusting mother."
Leslie Knope,"Since I'm here, I just wanted to let you know that Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"His name is Stuart, and he's kind of a grouch."
Leslie Knope,And you have an office mate.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Read me the script.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,On his face.
Leslie Knope,"He told me that he liked me, and I'm gonna go make out with him right now."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm not calling Ann, so Ann, we have a serious code Ben."
Leslie Knope,"The whiz palace, as I like to call it."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the bathroom.
Leslie Knope,I'm not buying cocaine.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go see a man about some porcelain, you know what I mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Shut up, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I know exactly when we should do it.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not just you."
Leslie Knope,"Post-pizza, pre-ice cream, between his third and fourth beer."
Leslie Knope,"He'll be full but not stuffed, tipsy but not drunk."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,That was really nice to hear.
Leslie Knope,Should be around 9:00.
Leslie Knope,Just sit tight.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Somebody made somebody a mix!
Leslie Knope,"No, you-- Then, Leslie, Leslie, you don't know what you're talking about."
Leslie Knope,"No, you're supposed to talk me out of this."
Leslie Knope,There's seven.
Leslie Knope,"And then 12:00 noon sharp is the inaugural ""D-Ann-ce Party."""
Leslie Knope,11 a.m. The start paperwork jamboree.
Leslie Knope,"10 a.m., Ann's first day waffle explosion."
Leslie Knope,We have activities every hour on your first day.
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever in her new part-time job in the Public Health Department at City Hall, it's Ann Meredith Perkins!"
Leslie Knope,Uh-oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Chris just wanted me to drop off these receipts.
Leslie Knope,"I care about him very much, and I've had two and a half glasses of red wine, and what that means is I'm gonna go make out with him right now, and it's gonna be awesome."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,"Well, actually, I think it's good that Chris showed up, 'cause I wasn't thinking clearly."
Leslie Knope,Good night.
Leslie Knope,"Good, I'm gonna go to bed."
Leslie Knope,"You, too."
Leslie Knope,"I think I might go to bed, too, actually."
Leslie Knope,Well Well
Leslie Knope,We're on Chris' couch.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we couldn't put you out like that."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Shut up, Ann, I'm doing it anyway."
Leslie Knope,"I love my job, Ben loves his job, and it's just not worth the risk."
Leslie Knope,How do you feel about my stance on Egyptian debt relief?
Leslie Knope,"And I definitely heard your feedback from last time, so I only put five Sarah McLachlan songs on this one."
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to delay the inevitable.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's not the best picture of him, but--"
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,She would love you for it.
Leslie Knope,"So, I made her a McSteamystyle music box, and I thought maybe you could give it to her."
Leslie Knope,The only thing my mom loves more than music boxes is McSteamy from Grey's Anatomy.
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, I'm a genius."
Leslie Knope,"Now, what I'm thinking is that maybe we should go over to her house"
Leslie Knope,Ooh! Hey.
Leslie Knope,The way you guys were connecting was really amazing.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you could tell instantly."
Leslie Knope,"What's so great is, she was impressed by you, too."
Leslie Knope,Yeah So you have a deal.
Leslie Knope,Crisis averted.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,They are really hitting it off.
Leslie Knope,This could not have gone better.
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, this is some of my best work."
Leslie Knope,Let's relax.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on."
Leslie Knope,I can't even have this conversation.
Leslie Knope,The whole thing is screwed up now.
Leslie Knope,"There's so many ways to destroy a bubble, but my mom flirting with you is number one on the list."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm sorry, I have to say this, were you asking for it in any way?"
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"I realize things have gotten a little out of control, and that's Ben's fault, and he's sorry."
Leslie Knope,"But I have an idea, and if you like it, I think we can end this right now."
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Pawnee of the future, congratulations."""
Leslie Knope,"""You have found a time capsule that was buried over 50 years ago."""
Leslie Knope,"""We wanted to include a collection of items that would best represent what life was like in our town at that moment."""
Leslie Knope,"""Instead, you'll find only one item, a video recording of a public forum we held in order to determine just what those items would be."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is truly what life was like."""
Leslie Knope,"""A lot of people with a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in."""
Leslie Knope,"""So enjoy watching it, assuming you still have electricity."""
Leslie Knope,He seems pretty self-assured.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,"That's what we thought, too."
Leslie Knope,"""A man named Jerry Gergich screwed up the recording somehow."""
Leslie Knope,"""He had one job to do."""
Leslie Knope,"Just-- Hey-- Hi, Mom."
Leslie Knope,Where are you going? Ben! Ben! Wait.
Leslie Knope,Just for a couple of weeks.
Leslie Knope,"You issue a government-wide memo about sexual harassment, and then you go to Mexico."
Leslie Knope,"""Sincerely, Pawnee of the past."""
Leslie Knope,Here's what we do.
Leslie Knope,How were you dressed?
Leslie Knope,"""And sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle."""
Leslie Knope,"Wow, maybe you should talk to him, Mom."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we could do this another time.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, but I'm having coffee with my daughter."
Leslie Knope,Abort.
Leslie Knope,Normal meeting rules do not apply.
Leslie Knope,It's a battle.
Leslie Knope,This is not a meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you need to be strong, powerful, decisive."
Leslie Knope,Let's get you certified.
Leslie Knope,"You're certified, right?"
Leslie Knope,And we could look at the whale sharks.
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to Belize and go scuba diving.
Leslie Knope,I thought they only wanted four.
Leslie Knope,"I'll be my mom and I'm gonna be very harsh with you, and it's only because I like you a lot."
Leslie Knope,"A cute fascist hardass, but still, you give off a very--"
Leslie Knope,No one's gonna believe that.
Leslie Knope,It's totally fine.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,No reason.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go ask her how it went, and I bet she loved you."
Leslie Knope,Everything's good?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I just want to enjoy the bubble for a little while.
Leslie Knope,But not yet.
Leslie Knope,"If this turns into something real, then we are gonna have to deal with Chris' rule, and parents, and annoying flossing habits, and a lot of unfun stuff."
Leslie Knope,"When I first met you, I thought you were a fascist hardass."
Leslie Knope,Should we?
Leslie Knope,Abort.
Leslie Knope,Whale tail.
Leslie Knope,"I just figured, hey, why not put my mother in a good mood?"
Leslie Knope,Of course!
Leslie Knope,Mommy.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,You have 10 minutes to memorize it.
Leslie Knope,"Here is a list of my mother's top starting with Persian rugs, ending with Daniel Craig."
Leslie Knope,"No, we need to put a pin in this."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,And now you've crossed your legs like a woman.
Leslie Knope,That's what she says to people.
Leslie Knope,She's flashing a whale tail.
Leslie Knope,"""Um"" is the sound in ""dumb."""
Leslie Knope,And you should be sitting by now.
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to discuss your rhyming, Dr. Seuss."
Leslie Knope,Just walk in and start talking.
Leslie Knope,No introductions.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I pre-dialed 911, so all you have to do is press send."
Leslie Knope,No preambles.
Leslie Knope,Wrong.
Leslie Knope,Go!
Leslie Knope,"If she binds your hands and you can't reach your phone, just try to chew yourself free."
Leslie Knope,Whale tail.
Leslie Knope,Just walk in and take a seat.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann, if you get this, I don't know if you should come up here."
Leslie Knope,I've been dreaming about running for public office my whole life.
Leslie Knope,I thought of a great headline.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what is this memo you sent to me?"
Leslie Knope,"""It's Time to Encapsulate the Future."""
Leslie Knope,And how is that gonna help?
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Sub headline, ""The Parks Department Cuts the Crapsule, Buries the Time Capsule."""
Leslie Knope,Where's Tammy One?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What is going on?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Can I help you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,We're not taking Twilight books.
Leslie Knope,You are the person that's been emailing me about Twilight.
Leslie Knope,I thought you would be younger.
Leslie Knope,And a girl.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, Kelly."
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,And plead your case.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,You're going all the way back to her birth.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, I have not."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Kelly, this time capsule isn't just a barrel full of stuff that people like."
Leslie Knope,You're not going to the battle royale?
Leslie Knope,And you can quote me on that.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Pawnee has had its set of problems, but this time capsule is our way of saying that Pawnee is gonna be around for a long time Capsule."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, first of all, it's disturbing that you wrote a memo, at all."
Leslie Knope,Neutered wimp?
Leslie Knope,But this?
Leslie Knope,"When Ron falls for Tammy Two, he turns into a demonic sex maniac."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Welcome, German soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"After the Nazis took France, our mayor kind of panicked."
Leslie Knope,I say you can go.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The factory fire capital of America."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Welcome, Vietnamese soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Engage with Zorp."""
Leslie Knope,You're going to lunch with me.
Leslie Knope,"For a brief time in the '70s, our town was taken over by a cult."
Leslie Knope,"It's about life in Pawnee at this moment in time, and there is nothing in Twilight that is specific to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Zorp is dead.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,We have to talk.
Leslie Knope,It's safe to be here now.
Leslie Knope,You and I are going to lunch.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Birthplace of Julia Roberts."""
Leslie Knope,Why do you not wanna do it now?
Leslie Knope,"That was a lie, she sued, and so we had to change it."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Home of the world-famous Julia Roberts lawsuit."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Welcome, Taliban soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,But you love arguing against government spending.
Leslie Knope,"And finally, our current slogan."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""First in friendship, fourth in obesity."""
Leslie Knope,Long live Zorp.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I have to say no.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Leslie Knope,"Same amount, every month."
Leslie Knope,"Well, looks like we have some actual receipts here."
Leslie Knope,"This one says, ""I bought supplies. 2007."""
Leslie Knope,"Ron, most of these aren't even receipts."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, buddy, time is up."
Leslie Knope,Give us the keys.
Leslie Knope,Then we're gonna have to cut you loose.
Leslie Knope,I will think of a better name for it by tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Rescue Ron"" is starting."
Leslie Knope,Settle in.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Leslie Knope,You're trespassing.
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Grab your calculators.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, April!"
Leslie Knope,My strategy is to win.
Leslie Knope,You could go to jail.
Leslie Knope,"Jail, Ron, jail."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, jail."
Leslie Knope,"Jail, Ron."
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,You could go to jail.
Leslie Knope,"Go ahead, Artie."
Leslie Knope,This is worse.
Leslie Knope,Some guy handcuffed himself to a pipe in my office because we wouldn't put a copy of Twilight in the time capsule.
Leslie Knope,How did you meet Tammy One?
Leslie Knope,He brought handcuffs with him.
Leslie Knope,This whole thing was planned.
Leslie Knope,It's not cool.
Leslie Knope,"It's trespassing, and that is breaking the rules."
Leslie Knope,Your moustache fell off.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,How can I help you?
Leslie Knope,Cool people make the rules.
Leslie Knope,They don't break the rules.
Leslie Knope,"And if those kids want you to break the rules, they're not really your friends."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna call security.
Leslie Knope,I'm just annoyed.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, sir."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,I'll I'll head down to payroll.
Leslie Knope,It's super fun.
Leslie Knope,He concerns me.
Leslie Knope,It's called the Battle Royale.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, II'm just wondering how long that's going to take, because Ron and I have a very important meeting together."
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, deputy"
Leslie Knope,I don't believe we've met.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"But while we're on the subject, your friend Orrin, with the long black nails and the cloak?"
Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Golden Dove"" is in trouble."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, there are some things I want to speak to you about but I'm not quite sure how to phrase them."
Leslie Knope,I was hoping to speak with Ron alone.
Leslie Knope,I checked every detail with the historical society.
Leslie Knope,That's impossible.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Nice work to you too.
Leslie Knope,Did you get it?
Leslie Knope,Thank you for that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, what have you chosen to put in the time capsule?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You told me you could get me that sticker.
Leslie Knope,"Then Joan slaps her sticker on it, best seller, four years in a row."
Leslie Knope,Unreadable.
Leslie Knope,A heartwarming story about a caveman eye doctor who travels to presentday Cincinnati and can see everything but love.
Leslie Knope,So how did the rest of the meeting go?
Leslie Knope,"Better than good, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, you're up."
Leslie Knope,"The Time Traveler's Optometrist, by Pawnee's own Penelope Foster."
Leslie Knope,And now she is the literary tastemaker in the town.
Leslie Knope,Joan Callamezzo started a book club four years ago.
Leslie Knope,Was my book selected for Joan's cook club?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I have Pawnee Today in an hour."
Leslie Knope,I just gave it to you an hour ago.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Something's off.
Leslie Knope,Aren't you sick?
Leslie Knope,"I started thinking about you as a woman, and as a person, and I got carried away."
Leslie Knope,But I wanted the first one that you owned to be delivered and signed by me.
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,I expect all of you to buy additional copies.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, she's not gonna getch me."
Leslie Knope,"Our journey begins on page one, the preface."
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming.
Leslie Knope,"Chris, Andy, we're gonna stay on schedule, and we're gonna do some damage control."
Leslie Knope,Get that sticker.
Leslie Knope,"Was I wearing a tiara when I came in here? Because if you happen upon it, will you have Lady Pennyface retrieve it and send it post-hence?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, Tom, you stay here, stay on Joan."
Leslie Knope,Not the gotcha dancers.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee!
Leslie Knope,"You put ""gotcha"" on my face."
Leslie Knope,That way.
Leslie Knope,"I have to tell you, this feels like gotcha journalism."
Leslie Knope,Did she say what it was?
Leslie Knope,I'd stake my reputation on it.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,Stick the
Leslie Knope,Stick the sticker.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, stick it."
Leslie Knope,I'll take the waffles.
Leslie Knope,"And I love the town so much, I literally wrote the book on it."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I was born and raised here, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"The rest of you, call me as soon as you find the mistake that does not exist."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need you to hit the road and reinterview everyone who lives out of town."
Leslie Knope,"So just in case there is a mistake, which there is not, I need all of you factchecking every single detail."
Leslie Knope,"Joan Callamezzo claims there is a mistake in my book, which there is not, and so now, she's trying to get me on a tiny technicality."
Leslie Knope,I was born in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,A brief history of everything that has ever happened since Pawnee was founded.
Leslie Knope,Why do you have so many guns?
Leslie Knope,Is this Ron?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Not like you get extra credit for this, but I did type it from memory."
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time ever compiled, it includes a complete list of every official town slogan we've ever had."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Can't you just move your butt around, or wear a dress made out of meat?"
Leslie Knope,"Listen, we need you to break Ron from her spell."
Leslie Knope,No offense.
Leslie Knope,And I am submitting this.
Leslie Knope,"And to beat Godzilla, we need Mothra."
Leslie Knope,You're literally a gold digger.
Leslie Knope,You gold digger.
Leslie Knope,Is this audit even real?
Leslie Knope,Let's cut the crap.
Leslie Knope,Can you believe it?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,"You're evil, and you need to go."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The Paris of America."""
Leslie Knope,Then I'll say it to her.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The Akron of Southwest Indiana."""
Leslie Knope,"Huh, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Basically, we're being attacked by Godzilla."
Leslie Knope,They are terrible.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the Battle Royale.
Leslie Knope,Right now.
Leslie Knope,"""Please enjoy a song from the lesbian Afro-Norwegian Funk duo, Nefertiti's Fjord."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,But should one?
Leslie Knope,One could say that.
Leslie Knope,"So we had people contribute, we added pictures, and we removed a lot of my poems and emotional ramblings and pictures of unicorns, and here it is!"
Leslie Knope,"I wrote it as a reference for myself, but then, my campaign advisor said we should make it a big, wide release."
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,The first historical guide to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,I wrote a book.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your family's weird."
Leslie Knope,Ah.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody prance, now! prance, prance, prance, prance, prance, prance"
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Leslie Knope,Wrah! I can't feel my face.
Leslie Knope,"Shh! Go to bed, Jimmy."
Leslie Knope,Glenn Close.
Leslie Knope,Marvin clods.
Leslie Knope,Not meven clarse.
Leslie Knope,I made a mistake.
Leslie Knope,Poison! Ugh! I made a mistake.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna join you and if I win, Ron stays here with us."
Leslie Knope,Let me in here.
Leslie Knope,"Pour me one, too, then."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? That wasn't the deal."
Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Soaring Falcon"" is in its final stages."
Leslie Knope,My face is numb.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"Jail, jail, jail."
Leslie Knope,"If he wants to stay in there, I'll let him stay in there."
Leslie Knope,"But this morning in the cold light of day, I cooked breakfast and we made out some more."
Leslie Knope,And then we made out and spent the night together.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I started crying because he gave me an eclair."
Leslie Knope,"Bad, really bad."
Leslie Knope,I need to talk to you about something
Leslie Knope,My campaign will be over before it begins.
Leslie Knope,I have a plan.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Kelly."
Leslie Knope,And it's really good.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna postpone telling him until you figure out what I'm supposed to do.
Leslie Knope,So get crackin'.
Leslie Knope,I didn't listen to what you just said.
Leslie Knope,Fine!
Leslie Knope,I'll do it.
Leslie Knope,"God, who keeps emailing me?"
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,Or good full disclosure.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks."
Leslie Knope,Did you have a nice night?
Leslie Knope,"He gave me an eclair, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,Read Twilight?
Leslie Knope,It would make a great human interest story.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't."
Leslie Knope,"Before, if people found out, we would maybe lose our jobs."
Leslie Knope,I highly doubt that.
Leslie Knope,"I really, really like you."
Leslie Knope,Here's the deal.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I would like a glass of red wine and I'll take the cheapest one you have because I can't tell the difference.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and I'm gonna be direct and honest with you."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if people find out, it's gonna be a major scandal."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go do my work in the conference room, 'cause you guys are the worst."
Leslie Knope,Do you need to get that?
Leslie Knope,Which is out of the question.
Leslie Knope,"Before I do this, is there any possible way that we could still keep dating?"
Leslie Knope,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Sleep well?
Leslie Knope,"I am, Kelly, because I know why you're here."
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,To impress your daughter?
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.
Leslie Knope,Yea.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"And, um, I just have something I've been postponing for a while that I need to do, but I'll do it now."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we'll do that then now soon."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is great."
Leslie Knope,You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.
Leslie Knope,I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.
Leslie Knope,"No, yeah."
Leslie Knope,In three months.
Leslie Knope,Was that okay?
Leslie Knope,Friday.
Leslie Knope,Then we shall bring the pipe to them.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, that's a good point."
Leslie Knope,"Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book."
Leslie Knope,Is that why you did this?
Leslie Knope,Picked you up some coffee.
Leslie Knope,How was that?
Leslie Knope,"When men in government behave this way, they betray the public's trust."
Leslie Knope,You know what I did last night?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's horrible."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I read the first 10 pages."
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't really get into it, though."
Leslie Knope,A penis.
Leslie Knope,Whoever this is sent it to every woman in the entire government.
Leslie Knope,"No, Andy, he did it on purpose."
Leslie Knope,More of a Harry Potter girl myself.
Leslie Knope,I need to talk to you.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,"But I looked in the inside cover, and I saw this."
Leslie Knope,Hioh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, Perd, it's not that big a deal."
Leslie Knope,If you know what I mean.
Leslie Knope,"Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straight-A student at King Philip Middle."
Leslie Knope,"She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time for more women to be in charge.
Leslie Knope,"Can you please, please be quiet?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful, naive, sophisticated, newborn baby."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess it's kind of interesting."
Leslie Knope,You knew?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"You're being really nice, and what I'm about to say is gonna make you hate me."
Leslie Knope,"Please stop bringing out the box, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"What the real story is is how wonderful our time capsule is and how it perfectly encapsulates, a word I really think you should use, what our town is all about."
Leslie Knope,"Please remember, this is a government project, so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious items."
Leslie Knope,"What I'm about to say is gonna contradict the idea that I really like you, but that won't change"
Leslie Knope,"I know I've been acting really weird lately, and, um, I really like you."
Leslie Knope,But today There's something else I have to do.
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, there will be a 300 page orientation booklet as well as a dozen homemade cookies in the shape of your face."
Leslie Knope,"Sure, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I think that's premature.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, City Council."
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna hear suggestions from everyone, and then whichever items we generally agree on will go into the time capsule."
Leslie Knope,That was uncalled for.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,Why? Why do we have to break up?
Leslie Knope,But I really like sleeping with my boss.
Leslie Knope,"In two hours, he's gonna be so hungry and freaked out, he's gonna be begging me to-- He brought a pillow."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is a federal tax audit."
Leslie Knope,Your worst nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"While other girls were playing with Barbies, I was playing with a Geraldine Ferraro action figure that I made myself from a picture of her that I glued onto a popsicle stick."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm looking forward to it."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, who's ready to get what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,"Every time another department asks for more money, he just stares them down until they back off and/or wet themselves."
Leslie Knope,Is this jewelry?
Leslie Knope,Our secret weapon in this budgetary battle Ron.
Leslie Knope,Budgetary Thunder Dome.
Leslie Knope,"Every department, in one room, arguing for more money."
Leslie Knope,"Ok guys, a Battle Royale is coming up."
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, and I am running for City Council."
Leslie Knope,"Friends, honored guests, Pawneeans."
Leslie Knope,Did I have a good opening line?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but I covered that pretty well."
Leslie Knope,How did you figure it out?
Leslie Knope,"So uhm, make a list of why other departments suck and I gonna get the secret weapon."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,So that's what today's forum is for.
Leslie Knope,He's so nice.
Leslie Knope,What is going on with Tammy one?
Leslie Knope,I didn't even ask you last night.
Leslie Knope,"But now I have to break up with him for real, but I don't wanna break up with him because he's so cute."
Leslie Knope,We're still dating.
Leslie Knope,Just don't
Leslie Knope,"I know I said that we broke up, but we couldn't."
Leslie Knope,"Friday, I'm supposed to announce that I'm running for City Council, and I haven't told Ben yet."
Leslie Knope,"Ok, so here's what's going on."
Leslie Knope,Running away from my problems.
Leslie Knope,Wait Ron.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I'm here for you because we need to talk about stuff.
Leslie Knope,"God, that's an amazing headline, but please don't write that story."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom the Whiz Palace, as we like to call it here and I'm going to be back and I'm not gonna split."
Leslie Knope,"After I tell him, I'm running for office, we're gonna have to break up."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I need to go to Another place."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'd really love to shoot a gun right now.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I can get Shauna on board."
Leslie Knope,I might not win.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."
Leslie Knope,You only have nine toes?
Leslie Knope,That's awful.
Leslie Knope,Meeting for the ladies' yacht club.
Leslie Knope,"Given your hunting abilities and my chocolate supply, I figure we could stay up here for two three years."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Uh Lady just ladies.
Leslie Knope,I always carry emergency s'more rations in my car.
Leslie Knope,"I figure we build a fire, roast the fish we shot, and make s'mores."
Leslie Knope,"Anchors away, ladies."
Leslie Knope,I might not run.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Especially if you only have nine toes.
Lester Kanopf,That's mine.
Liam Bonneville,"So you're the author of the famous river cleanup proposal, huh?"
Liam Bonneville,It wasn't bad.
Linda Lonegan,"Oh, sure."
Linda Lonegan,You're taking this class pass fail.
Linda Lonegan,"So I'm just looking for a freewheeling discussion about, you know, what you got from the class."
Linda Lonegan,"I guess now that the class is over, there's nothing wrong with it."
Linda Lonegan,Andy
Linda Lonegan,Oh?
Linda Lonegan,I agree.
Linda Lonegan,Right.
Linda Lonegan,Thank you.
Linda Lonegan,"Andy, slow down."
Linda Lonegan,You guys have a good time.
Linda Lonegan,"According to Andy, you're quite the feminist."
Linda Lonegan,Many societal institutions were established solely to oppress women.
Linda Lonegan,My Uncle Lon once tried to
Linda Lonegan,Sounds great.
Linda Lonegan,That is extremely incorrect.
Linda Lonegan,I'm sorry.
Linda Lonegan,"Oh, yeah, that was one of your most readable papers."
Linda Lonegan,"To this day, some feminists have even condemned marriage as a glorified form of slavery."
Linda Lonegan,What kind of dressings do you have?
Linda Lonegan,"My father once told my mother that woman was made from the rib of Adam, and my mom broke his jaw."
Linda Lonegan,It's impossible.
Linda Lonegan,Or how about you and I go back to my place?
Linda Lonegan,"As she was burned at the stake, Joan of Arc did not cower."
Linda Lonegan,She did not beg for mercy.
Linda Lonegan,"Oh, you as well."
Linda Lonegan,"she said, in a strong, clear voice, ""I am not afraid."""
Linda Lonegan,"""I was born to do this."""
Linda Lonegan,"I'm really flattered, but I just got out of a relationship, and I think I need a little more time before I jump into anything."
Linda Lonegan,Thank you.
Linda Lonegan,"I'll have the, uh, spinach salad."
Linda Lonegan,"I don't consider myself an anythingist, but my life has been shaped by powerful women."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"I didn't expect to see the whole Parks Department here, although it is, sadly, one of the nicest spots in town."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,This place hasn't changed a bit.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Hi, Dan."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Wow.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Thank you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's not important.

Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Nice retort, did G.B. Shaw write that for you?"
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Leslie Knope.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,What's going on here?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"What if someone hits a homerun, how will you get the ball back?"
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Why?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I do still have that sweatshirt.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You did all of this in a day?

Lindsay Carlisle Shay,So cute and so good.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I'm sorry.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Thanks to Leslie Knope.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,But it was good seeing you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Sweetie, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, Pawnee is and always will be a dirty, little nightmare from which you will never wake up."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence stays up.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Hello, Pawnee."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Welcome to our public forum.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Hmm.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Okay.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's just a crappy little park.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,What do you care?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Yes.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,A private park that's not for everyone.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You know what's really great?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I was just at the stables.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You look like you've been working hard.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You have a million flyaways right now.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I'm only trying to protect our children.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Here's to you, Joey, and your mother and to every Pawnee citizen who might have a bright future if they fundamentally change everything about themselves."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Oh.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"It's just, nursing... You must be so tired and sad."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,This is a perfect example of how we're going to help you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I was passing through Pawnee anyway.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I do a lot of charity work here.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Isn't she trying her hardest?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"We've got a little bit of Eagleton business, and then I'll introduce you."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Oh.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Look at that.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Let me get a closer look.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Well, you don't have my job because you knew you couldn't handle it."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Would you like to borrow a mirror or a selfhelp book?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Oh, yes."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The forum is beginning.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,There's only so much you can do.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Yeah.
Lon Swanson,Ron.
Lord Covington,We don't own that.
Lord Covington,"Where do you think you are, the moon?"
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Lord Covington,Could we?
Lord Covington,Let's go.
Lord Covington,Just throw it there.
Lord Covington,Roger will pick it up.
Lord Covington,"I bought them for one of my nephews, and then I decided to keep them."
Lord Covington,Shall we?
Lord Covington,"Well, I'm excited to hear about your musical charity idea."
Lord Covington,"No, no, no, no, he's absolutely right, it's an absurd name."
Lord Covington,Aluminium.
Lord Covington,"Okay, okay."
Lord Covington,You say it.
Lord Covington,You say it.
Lord Covington,You say it.
Lord Covington,"""Alumilum""?"
Lord Covington,Of course we have it.
Lord Covington,We have it.
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Lord Covington,"Well, um, have you heard of Scotland?"
Lord Covington,Would you like to play with them?
Lord Covington,I call the oh.
Lord Covington,"Okay, you get the blue one."
Lord Covington,He called it.
Lord Covington,That's the rule.
Lord Covington,"Anyway, the orange one's better."
Lord Covington,Come on.
Lord Covington,Mmhmm.
Lord Covington,"Hey, get off!"
Lord Covington,Watch out!
Lord Covington,Agh!
Lord Covington,"Oh, bummer."
Lord Covington,"Well, no, not everything."
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Lord Covington,"We own that building, that one, that house, that round thing, that one."
Lord Covington,"Oh, no, actually, we do own that."
Lord Covington,"Okay, watch out!"
Lord Covington,"Yes, of course."
Lord Covington,I got them as a gift.
Lord Covington,My family has a huge amount of money.
Lord Covington,I'm kidding.
Lord Covington,"The thing is, I don't know what I'm doing."
Lord Covington,"No, no, no, I'm kidding."
Lord Covington,I'm in.
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Lord Covington,"I like you, I like music."
Lord Covington,Brilliant!
Lord Covington,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Lord Covington,"No, no, I meant Andy."
Lord Covington,"However, the proper mode of address would be ""Your Royal Excellency, Lord Edgar Darby Covington, ""14th Earl of Cornwall upon Thames, 29th Baron of Hertfordshire."""
Lord Covington,"Well, it's nice to meet you too."
Lord Covington,I want Andy to stay.
Lord Covington,"Please, call me Eddie."
Lord Covington,"The point is, I started this foundation in order to do something good with our money, and I've heard hundreds of charity pitches, and I honestly don't know whether they're good or bad."
Lord Covington,Let's see if it was a goose.
Lord Covington,"We live in a castle that has 1,000 acres of land."
Lord Covington,"Our hedge maze is so vast, once, I got lost in there for two days."
Lord Covington,It was awesome.
Lord Covington,"There was a statue of a lion inside, and I found a yoyo."
Lucy,And it'd be super fun to work with you.
Lucy,"I believe you when you say that you're not in love with Wendy anymore, but you're definitely not cool with her dating Ron."
Lucy,"See you, Ron."
Lucy,"Damn, Tommy, well done!"
Lucy,Plural?
Lucy,With kids?
Lucy,You talk about it constantly.
Lucy,"What do you think, Ron?"
Lucy,"Well, not if I had a great new boyfriend, dumbass."
Lucy,Tommy's the man.
Lucy,"He's taken with me, huh?"
Lucy,What?
Lucy,"Wait, now we're on an island?"
Lucy,What is happening right now?
Lucy,"Look, Tom, I like you."
Lucy,"You're really cute and you're funny, and you're small enough for me to throw you around."
Lucy,"Of course, what's up?"
Lucy,"Wow, really? That does sound kinda awesome."
Lucy,"So if you ever work through this, then give me a call."
Lucy,"I mean, I'd have to talk to my boyfriend about it first, butâ¦"
Lucy,You're welcome.
Lucy,"Dude, thank you so much for this."
Lucy,Yeah.
Lucy,Which was a long time coming but it's still weird.
Lucy,I broke up with Conrad.
Lucy,Yeah.
Lucy,Kind of weird.
Lucy,Thanks.
Lucy,I don't think I'm ready to discuss it just yet.
Lucy,But what I would like to do is have a glass of wine and talk about that shade Nicki Minaj threw at Jesse Eisenberg at the BAFTAs.
Lucy,"No, he didn't!"
Lucy,It was okay.
Lucy,I really owe you one.
Lucy,"Hey, boss."
Lucy,"Before you go, can you sign some checks?"
Lucy,"In case something happens to you, I wanna make sure I get paid."
Lucy,"Well, breakups are famously super fun and make everyone feel awesome."
Lucy,"So, it's no different."
Lucy,"Stop, you're making this sound almost too fun."
Lucy,"Dude, you are totally going to jail."
Lucy,Do you want to try it?
Lucy,"One XXL, one kid's XL."
Lucy,"Tommy, I was at the nail salon and I picked up some geranium hand cream."
Lucy,I wanna go with you as your date.
Lucy,I was gonna say that I wouldn't wanna go with you as friends.
Lucy,Just hold on.
Lucy,"I'm just gonna go and make sure everything is set for tonight, okay?"
Lucy,You don't have to do this.
Lucy,Oh.
Lucy,"So, I was thinking about the idea of going to Donna's wedding."
Lucy,Uneventful.
Lucy,How was everything here?
Lucy,How was your trip?
Lucy,Hey!
Lucy,Oh!
Lucy,Do mine first.
Lucy,Yeah.
Lucy,I'm fine with whatever.
Lucy,Ah! What the hell?
Lucy,Excuse me.
Lucy,You wanna go to Ann's house?
Lucy,Hey.
Lucy,That guy rules.
Lucy,Wow.
Lucy,He hated both.
Lucy,My father told me that a limp handshake was for weak men and Communists.
Lucy,Thanks.
Lucy,Hi.
Lucy,You always do.
Lucy,And you'll come up with a new idea.
Lucy,"Well, you and I are going to be fine."
Lucy,You've just got to move on.
Lucy,Who could have predicted that the country would run out of beef?
Lucy,"The stock market tanked, credit dried up."
Lucy,"Look, you had a tough break."
Lucy,That you made!
Lucy,"Tommy, you've got to stop watching this."
Lucy,"Hey, babe."
Lucy,Hi.
Lucy,I'm Lucy.
Lucy,Hey.
Lucy,What is all this?
Lucy,Yes!
Lucy,Yes.
Lucy,"You guys know Tom really well, so I don't have to apologize for his behavior, right?"
Lucy,"Thanks, it's gonna be fun."
Lucy,Yeah.
Lucy,Tom?
Lucy,I thought that was you.
Lucy,What are you doing here?
Lucy,Okay.
Lucy,So you didn't mean what you said?
Lucy,"Well, I'm only dating you for the free dresses, soâ¦"
Lucy,What? Who is that?
Lucy,Let me give you my phone number.
Lucy,I'm Lucy.
Lucy,"Then, sure."
Lucy,"Actually, that's the reason."
Lucy,So how long is this shutdown going to last?
Lucy,Is this an autographed picture of Jamie Foxx?
Lucy,Yeah.
Lucy,But awesome.
Lucy,"I mean, what were you expecting was gonna happen, a 43-way?"
Lucy,I always kinda liked it there.
Lucy,"Part of me wants to go back, you know."
Lucy,I'll do whatever you want.
Lucy,That's the dream.
Lucy,It sounds like it's really changed.
Lucy,"Yeah, tell me about Pawnee."
Lucy,"And obviously, everyone's in a really great mood now because of the Cubs winning the series."
Lucy,"Yeah, I think you're really gonna like it here."
Lucy,"You invited a bunch of girls here, and then you tried to hit on all of them."
Lucy,No.
Lucy,Do you wanna meet me here in an hour?
Lucy,"Well, listen, I got some stuff I gotta do in the office, but I wanna hang out."
Lucy,"Cool, what job is it?"
Lucy,Yeah.
Lucy,Was it your bachelorette party?
Lucy,"You had 47 drinks last night? Ten cosmos, eight Smirnoff Ices, and everything else starts with the word pomegranate."
Lucy,Wow.
Lucy,"You're not gonna murder me, are you?"
Lucy,Finally!
Lucy,Uh It's nothing to do with Twilight. It just didn't work out.
Lucy,Does it have to be here?
Lucy,I only have a second.
Lucy,I'll see you around.
Lucy,Tom.
Lucy,Jean-Ralphio called me and told me that this was a very special occasion and I should come down.
Lucy,It's nice to see you.
Lucy,You too.
Lucy,I have to get to work.
Lucy,Okay.
Lucy,"Grad school's fun, but I do miss this town."
Lucy,Want to go dance?
Lucy,"Nah, I'm heading to Bloomington right now."
Lucy,What's wrong?
Lucy,Hey.
Lucy,"Well, if it's any consolation, this was honestly the best party I've ever been to."
Lucy,Hey.
Madeleine Albright,And why have we had lunch so many times?
Madeleine Albright,I haven't seen you this upset since you almost forgot Ann's half birthday.
Madeleine Albright,Tell me.
Madeleine Albright,How many times have we had lunch?
Madeleine Albright,"Wow, Leslie."
Madeleine Albright,"I'm so glad that you did, and you are a wonderful friend."
Madeleine Albright,But you have to realize April has to be able to make up her own mind.
Madeleine Albright,"Well, you were so wrapped up in your story that you actually ate my waffle."
Madeleine Albright,"Sometimes, all you can do is give people a little bit of advice and a push."
Madeleine Albright,Can I have my pin back now?
Madeleine Albright,"Me, too."
Madeleine Albright,"But sometimes, you're so focused and driven that you forget about people's feelings."
Madison,And we asked them all to submit a song for the new town anthem contest.
Madison,Manning that art tents.
Madison,What's wrong with her? Why is making those noises?
Madison,"Plus, we'll have tents for art exhibits and panels, and maybe a short film festival."
Madison,"You know, people will go to parts of the town they don't usually go to."
Madison,We want to have a bunch of different band stages.
Madison,"So far, 12 bands have said yes."
Manrico Della Rossa,"And if elected, I will fight for them as if they are my own children."
Manrico Della Rossa,And anyone who even rubs their hands on a leather jacket should be tried for murder.
Manrico Della Rossa,Anteaters.
Manrico Della Rossa,"Today, there are only 595 million."
Manrico Della Rossa,I believe animals are as important as people.
Manrico Della Rossa,I am Manrico Della Rossa.
Manrico Della Rossa,"At that rate, they'll all be gone by the year 203060."
Manrico Della Rossa,"In 1980, there were more than 600 million Indiana Brown Ants in that forest."
Manrico Della Rossa,Yes.
Marci,Leslie.
Marci,"Oh, I guess not."
Marci,It's a movie.
Marci,Let's see.
Marci,Are they finally teaching you Parks people how to read?
Marci,You seem to have a 40 dollars late fee on a book called Mysteries of the Female Orgasm.
Marci,"Yeah, you do."
Marci,Hmm.
Marcia Langman,Destroy it.
Marcia Langman,There really is a tremendous amount of quivering.
Marcia Langman,"It is anti-Christian, it is pro-quivering, and the government has no business promoting it."
Marcia Langman,"There are boys staring deeply into girls' eyes as they quiver, and so forth."
Marcia Langman,That would do it.
Marcia Langman,"Move to a different town? No, I kid."
Marcia Langman,Whoo!
Marcia Langman,"Well, you could resign, if you're up for it."
Marcia Langman,Who had sex with what and gave birth to which?
Marcia Langman,And how did it get like that?
Marcia Langman,"Oh, thank you so much."
Marcia Langman,"So, you will not be annulling the marriage?"
Marcia Langman,Is that right?
Marcia Langman,I'd ask you to reconsider.
Marcia Langman,I think that's a valuable point.
Marcia Langman,"She could learn a little something about traditional family structure from me and my husband, Marshall."
Marcia Langman,Leslie Knope exemplifies the feminist attack on our values.
Marcia Langman,You promised?
Marcia Langman,I was just hoping you had a moment to discuss the events at the zoo yesterday.
Marcia Langman,I'm so glad you've come to your senses.
Marcia Langman,"And now, this town a horrifying sex den where people can put their body parts anywhere they want to with impunity."
Marcia Langman,No Twilight!
Marcia Langman,"Well, maybe not where you come from in ""Trampsylvania."""
Marcia Langman,"I'm Marcia Langman, from the Society for Family Stability Foundation."
Marcia Langman,This book contains pagan creatures and strong sexual overtones.
Marcia Langman,There are girls quivering.
Marcia Langman,Whoo!
Marcia Langman,"And then, you were elected."
Marcia Langman,That's not fair!
Marcia Langman,Gay perverts.
Marcia Langman,Why would I go to Russia? I have no interest in traveling to Russia. Can I just say that?
Marcia Langman,Let's start with government funded animal porn.
Marcia Langman,Why am I upset?
Marcia Langman,So how do you want to do this?
Marcia Langman,Burn it publicly or burn it privately and I put the footage on my blog
Marcia Langman,"I say, this painting is going to burn."
Marcia Langman,Europeans.
Marcia Langman,"First here, then in hell."
Marcia Langman,Do I need to get this validated?
Marcia Langman,"Okay, I'll just pull my car around and you can load it in the back."
Marcia Langman,"Hey, come back here."
Marcia Langman,Annul the wedding!
Marcia Langman,Thank you.
Marcia Langman,"I'm glad you finally came to your senses, I'm sure that's not an easy journey for you to make."
Marcia Langman,"Perd, we strongly believe in teaching and practicing abstinence."
Marcia Langman,"Go back to Russia, commie!"
Marcia Langman,"If I'm headed to the parking lot, do I make a left out of here, or do I go right?"
Marcia Langman,"If we allow this filth to be taught to our seniors, the next you thing you know, it'll be in our high schools, then our kindergartens, and before you know it, we have babies in thong underwear."
Marcia Langman,You know what?
Marcia Langman,"So, either you annul the wedding, or I'll publicly ask for your resignation."
Marcia Langman,"So you couldn't possibly understand, but when gays marry, it ruins marriage for the rest of us."
Marcia Langman,I thought so.
Marcia Langman,It's against Pawnee's abstinence only sex education law.
Marcia Langman,We at the society for family stability foundation object to this smut being taught.
Marcia Langman,"Leslie, are you married?"
Marcia Langman,"Well, why else would you marry penguins?"
Marcia Langman,"When you performed a marriage for gay penguins, using taxpayer money on government property, you were symbolically taking a stand in favor of the gay marriage agenda."
Marcia Langman,"Joan, we don't want to be unreasonable."
Marcia Langman,"We think that she should separate the penguins, annul the marriage, reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of the wedding, of course, and then resign."
Marcia Langman,"I want it destroyed, and I want a statement from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction of bestiality."
Marcia Langman,Perverts.
Marcia Langman,Is that what you want?
Marcia Langman,I'm so terrible with directions.
Marcia Langman,"The fuss is that Miss Knope claimed that she was not advocating for this gay cause, and then that very night, she was the guest of honor at a pro-gay marriage rally at a bar called The Bulge."
Marcia Langman,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Maria Portlesman,"I'll need some help moving the boxes, but it's doable."
Maria Portlesman,Please.
Maria Portlesman,No charge.
Maria Portlesman,I just appreciate the chance to demonstrate how valuable my class is to the rec center.
Maria Portlesman,"Oh, of course not."
Maria Portlesman,And I hope you'll keep that in mind.
Maria Portlesman,"No, no, I insist on demonstrating."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I am in."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, our relationship was so great."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no, no, no, not me."
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why not?
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I got my truck all cleaned out and ready to go for tomorrow."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Do you have, like, furniture pads and dollies?"
Mark Brendanawicz,That sort of thing?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not a mover!
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm a sap who owns a truck.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,With Justin?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, but for example, we barely ever fought."
Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, I just have to say, I think you might be taking this to the public a little bit too soon."
Mark Brendanawicz,No!
Mark Brendanawicz,It literally doesn't matter what you propose to the public.
Mark Brendanawicz,What do I do with that?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Was there something wrong, Ann?"
Mark Brendanawicz,I really did think that that stuff that I said was off the record.
Mark Brendanawicz,Really?
Mark Brendanawicz,"They might call for a vote, and if they vote you down, then you're done."
Mark Brendanawicz,You look like you need one of these.
Mark Brendanawicz,What's that?
Mark Brendanawicz,I [bleep] hate having a pickup truck.
Mark Brendanawicz,You do look kind of miserable.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'll help you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm totally blanking on a valid excuse right now, so, yes."
Mark Brendanawicz,I think I can figure out the right way to ask her.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm so sorry.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's what's called being an amazing boyfriend.
Mark Brendanawicz,"She mentioned it to me two months ago, and I wrote it down."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, you're not gonna go?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, I'm Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz,Pleasure.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, there."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy, so, naturally, I came to you for reassurance."
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on!
Mark Brendanawicz,Feel better?
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't tell Ann that we talked about this.
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no such thing as a city planning emergency.
Mark Brendanawicz,"On television, though?"
Mark Brendanawicz,I've been doing some thinking.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, Tom, she needs one."
Mark Brendanawicz,Do me a favor.
Mark Brendanawicz,You... That was not my intention.
Mark Brendanawicz,But that stuff was off the record.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,I think you now owe me 25 dollars.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, Jerry."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, Jerry."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,Ow!
Mark Brendanawicz,And that's game.
Mark Brendanawicz,What was that about?
Mark Brendanawicz,"We didn't think you were a pervert, we thought you were a criminal."
Mark Brendanawicz,"When you were dating Ann, did you know this guy Justin?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, that's funny, because a little birdie told me that your adoptive mother was arrested for marijuana possession."
Mark Brendanawicz,Diamonds?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,What do you think I should get her?
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You didn't know that, huh?"
Mark Brendanawicz,It's like underwater ballet.
Mark Brendanawicz,Have you ever seen this man sleep?
Mark Brendanawicz,It's really nice of you to compliment my pickup truck with no ulterior motives.
Mark Brendanawicz,It kind of does.
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's enough.
Mark Brendanawicz,Should I get you guys home right now?
Mark Brendanawicz,That's enough.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, okay, then."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I was not trying to ask you out, I promise."
Mark Brendanawicz,"See you, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's fine.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Thanks, Nate."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, that makes sense."
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,"""Bring a case of"" Yeah, this one's our fault, Ron, and we will take care of this for you."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in."
Mark Brendanawicz,Terrible things happened last time.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, yeah, 'cause parties usually get started when you run out of booze."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow."
Mark Brendanawicz,Did you get everything up to code?
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Mark Brendanawicz,Well done.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm sorry.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm gonna get out of here.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm sorry.
Mark Brendanawicz,Go rent a bulldozer and fill in the freaking pit.
Mark Brendanawicz,Shut up.
Mark Brendanawicz,For what?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you so much.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, we'll go together."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's the cue.
Mark Brendanawicz,"See you later, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow.
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Mark Brendanawicz,"It was nice hanging out, you know, after work hours."
Mark Brendanawicz,We're not.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, would you please stop texting me that you're having a city planning emergency?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why wouldn't you set her up with Justin?
Mark Brendanawicz,He hangs out at a bar in Eagleton.
Mark Brendanawicz,There is a man named Duke Silver.
Mark Brendanawicz,Not my style.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, I'm starting to feel kind of gross about this game."
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think Ron is fine.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,"He's an old friend of Ron's, maybe you should ask him."
Mark Brendanawicz,Tom.
Mark Brendanawicz,I am the Pants--
Mark Brendanawicz,No!
Mark Brendanawicz,Bow to me.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,I got you a gift.
Mark Brendanawicz,I am the Pants King!
Mark Brendanawicz,Sneak attack!
Mark Brendanawicz,What's up?
Mark Brendanawicz,That's good.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Even though you did just call him a big, lying baby."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, then just go up there and say hello and start talking to her."
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, I did! And now we both have herpes."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'll see you later.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why don't you see a movie or go shopping?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I do find you attractive.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, going forward."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, that might be the chew."
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,"But if I were, would you be interested?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you have to say it's off the record?
Mark Brendanawicz,I promise you.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,You could spit it out.
Mark Brendanawicz,Technically.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I got her a pretty great computer bag."
Mark Brendanawicz,My girlfriend's ex is working 100 feet away from my desk and he's been pretty clear about wanting her back.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's where I never find things.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm in.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you suggesting a game?
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you allowed to kiss me in a hospital room?
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know how to explain--
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm sure that you think that you're clean, but I bet that we could find something on you."
Mark Brendanawicz,I was going to go to Arby's and watch Frontline.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, what's broken?"
Mark Brendanawicz,You're just asking to have your entire life exposed.
Mark Brendanawicz,They're required to.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why does anybody wanna run for public office?
Mark Brendanawicz,"By law, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,You guys are together?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, yeah, like poles for stop signs."
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, you're married, and you hit on women constantly."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, I'm not an artist."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, it is an old man feeding pigeons in a park."
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Go home, lay low."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I've never had that debate with anyone, Andy."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, it's not."
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's like what motels put up, and it hangs there for years, and no one ever throws acid at it."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know if that's true or not.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's mass appeal.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm saying that this will win.
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh... The spirit of Pawnee?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Dark ending, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not saying that this is any good.
Mark Brendanawicz,Nice to meet you.
Mark Brendanawicz,You want me to come over after work?
Mark Brendanawicz,I didn't volunteer.
Mark Brendanawicz,Easy.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm just saying that this will win.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I have no dog in this fight."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I knew, eventually, somehow, being in a relationship with you would totally pay off."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm a city planner.
Mark Brendanawicz,Greg Kinnear.
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,Happy Valentine's Day.
Mark Brendanawicz,"First off, a bear in a paper bag and a heartshaped balloon."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you will like this, then."
Mark Brendanawicz,Because this is a giant teddy bear holding a red heart.
Mark Brendanawicz,Festive.
Mark Brendanawicz,What's this?
Mark Brendanawicz,That's so nice.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I don't know."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's a dozen red roses in a heart-shaped arrangement.
Mark Brendanawicz,See that?
Mark Brendanawicz,Perfume.
Mark Brendanawicz,For the lady.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Finally, The Heart of the Ocean."
Mark Brendanawicz,I never had a chance to get a girl a cliched Valentine's Day gift before.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
Mark Brendanawicz,Uhoh!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, I just got your 15 texts."
Mark Brendanawicz,How you spell your name.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Andy."
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,Featuring Bill Paxton.
Mark Brendanawicz,"What a surprise, running into you all day, every day, every single place that we are."
Mark Brendanawicz,And what you guys have here is one ugly camel.
Mark Brendanawicz,For what?
Mark Brendanawicz,The camel was actually a horse designed by a committee.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,You've never heard that saying?
Mark Brendanawicz,She'll get back to you on that.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'll see you Monday, okay?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,What is that?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, God."
Mark Brendanawicz,Mmmhmm.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, I'm gonna get out of here."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you made a camel."
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, okay."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You, you're the best girlfriend ever."
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you think I should do it, though."
Mark Brendanawicz,She was just my grandma.
Mark Brendanawicz,Really well.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, our relationship is going well."
Mark Brendanawicz,I suppose that I am.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, okay."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you kind of dropped the ball with Andy then, didn't you?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, sorry I'm late."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, Donna."
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you kidding me?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God."
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know really what I want to say.
Mark Brendanawicz,It would make a great story.
Mark Brendanawicz,I trust Leslie.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know.
Mark Brendanawicz,Where do you want this?
Mark Brendanawicz,What do you think I should do?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I guess I could go home and get it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Tom."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I didn't say anything to her.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why is this a big deal to anybody?
Mark Brendanawicz,You said it was just odds and ends.
Mark Brendanawicz,But there's tons of guys out there who have jobs and who respect you and think you're attractive.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, what's up?"
Mark Brendanawicz,You haven't even folded up the boxes yet.
Mark Brendanawicz,But I guess I just don't get it.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why?
Mark Brendanawicz,We should really pack this room up and get moving.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie.
Mark Brendanawicz,That guy really seemed dead.
Mark Brendanawicz,"""Bring a case of beer to Sanitation."""
Mark Brendanawicz,This is your bedroom?
Mark Brendanawicz,What is that?
Mark Brendanawicz,I have my grandma's ring.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no!"
Mark Brendanawicz,The truth will come out.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you for meeting with me again.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think it's going fine.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't get you andâ¦ I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm sure that the voters would be able to tell the difference.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You understand that, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,How many discussion questions do you have there?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Since you brought it up, I'm just gonna say it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"In the scenario you just laid out, you're the pervert."
Mark Brendanawicz,Neither is Ann.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I'll see you tonight, for the weirdest second date ever."
Mark Brendanawicz,Great.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And I don't want you to feel bad about not getting me anything, because I would never expect--"
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not going to ask Ann to move in with me.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I'm looking for scandalous information about my coworkers, for a game that we're playing."
Mark Brendanawicz,What are you... What are you doing here?
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi there.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Parks Department."
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a classic mistake.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's not a failure, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,Camel's way more fun.
Mark Brendanawicz,Go ahead.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you telling us we have to unload this and move it back in the house?
Mark Brendanawicz,They went super patriotic.
Mark Brendanawicz,"See you, Tom."
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely no point of view whatsoever.
Mark Brendanawicz,No stance.
Mark Brendanawicz,Old man feeding pigeons?
Mark Brendanawicz,Us?
Mark Brendanawicz,"And in government, there's always someone who will oppose a stance."
Mark Brendanawicz,"It seems crowd pleasing, but it's still a stance."
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow!
Mark Brendanawicz,"I mean, I like Andy a lot."
Mark Brendanawicz,You wanna get the pit filled in?
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's nobody, it's you."
Mark Brendanawicz,You have to be bold.
Mark Brendanawicz,"That's what you wanted, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,That's why you didn't set Leslie up.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look around, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's really nice of you.
Mark Brendanawicz,I hooked your toilet up to your shower.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm sorry, but there's just something weird about the way you talk about him."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I mean, there's crap everywhere."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Plus, I've always said we should go on more dates with Tom."
Mark Brendanawicz,Good.
Mark Brendanawicz,He was shot in the back of the head.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, should I give them some background info on the site?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Awesome.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi there.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I have something for you, too."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie might have oversold me a little bit.
Mark Brendanawicz,Because you're saving him.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah, you are."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, it is."
Mark Brendanawicz,Excellent.
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't shoot anyone!
Mark Brendanawicz,Even I know that.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Apparently, what I can achieve in government can literally be measured."
Mark Brendanawicz,Beers to go!
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I got it lowered 2 inches."
Mark Brendanawicz,I actually got you a second gift.
Mark Brendanawicz,You think I can get my beer bottle in that shopping cart right there?
Mark Brendanawicz,Glad to have you.
Mark Brendanawicz,You can't save somebody for the future while you're in a relationship.
Mark Brendanawicz,This is awesome!
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, but the important part of what I said was, ""Stay in bed."""
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you like it?
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,Justin?
Mark Brendanawicz,"If I'm late for dinner one night, you're gonna dump me for Dustin?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Actually, I did hear something."
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,Let me get you a beer.
Mark Brendanawicz,One beer bottle is not gonna make any difference.
Mark Brendanawicz,Here you go.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,Did I screw up?
Mark Brendanawicz,You sure?
Mark Brendanawicz,I sort of threw together some plans for a future park.
Mark Brendanawicz,I couldn't fit everything in that you wanted.
Mark Brendanawicz,Like the roller coaster or the shark tank.
Mark Brendanawicz,But I think it's a pretty good start.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're really welcome.
Mark Brendanawicz,This is great.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's personal.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm gonna say something.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I would've said anything at that point if I thought it would make you stay in bed."
Mark Brendanawicz,Drink that.
Mark Brendanawicz,I wouldn't bet against you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Win win.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Unbelievable! That's unbelievable! You missed the entire pit, which is huge, by the way."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,Go on and chuck it.
Mark Brendanawicz,I actually think that you have a bigger problem than the money.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're gonna drive yourself crazy trying to follow every single rule in government.
Mark Brendanawicz,What a great way to spend my time.
Mark Brendanawicz,Lot 48 is It's a rectangular lot.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's got excellent drainage.
Mark Brendanawicz,And it's on the corner of Sullivan and Collins.
Mark Brendanawicz,Any questions?
Mark Brendanawicz,"There is someone in your department who is willing to lie about being mugged, because he's afraid of his co-workers."
Mark Brendanawicz,Go for it.
Mark Brendanawicz,See?
Mark Brendanawicz,Wouldn't you rather the money go to keeping the parks safe?
Mark Brendanawicz,I love canvassing.
Mark Brendanawicz,It was pretty close!
Mark Brendanawicz,This is so great.
Mark Brendanawicz,You think you can do any better?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You're the Deputy Director of Parks and blah blah-- You know, nobody's gonna see it."
Mark Brendanawicz,Damn it! I was so close there!
Mark Brendanawicz,See you around.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you?
Mark Brendanawicz,You don't have to come to this game with me.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you okay?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, well, you know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains, too."
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that weird?
Mark Brendanawicz,That was silly.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're insane.
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't ever apologize to me.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm serious.
Mark Brendanawicz,It can be tricky dealing
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, welcome to the team."
Mark Brendanawicz,"""The greatest guy ever""?"
Mark Brendanawicz,What is up?
Mark Brendanawicz,Deputy Director Knope.
Mark Brendanawicz,Where do you think you're going?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You've just made a surprising amount of sense, Tom."
Mark Brendanawicz,Pretty much every guy in city planning has a bunch of letters.
Mark Brendanawicz,Go.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Cause I think the movie starts in like... Oh, you're joking around right now."
Mark Brendanawicz,Seriously?
Mark Brendanawicz,"That would be 6,400 dollars."
Mark Brendanawicz,I accept checks and most major credit cards.
Mark Brendanawicz,I am.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I think I'm done, Andy."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You, be you."
Mark Brendanawicz,I liked this a lot better when it was a pit.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Leslie!"
Mark Brendanawicz,"If everyone in government were like you, then I would probably still work there."
Mark Brendanawicz,We don't have any pictures of just the two of us.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, how about this?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you win, you don't owe me any money, but if I win, you have to stop bugging me and Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No more comments, no more showing up when we're hanging out together."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,You have to leave us alone.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you ready to go?"
Mark Brendanawicz,I got seven letters in my file.
Mark Brendanawicz,You have nothing else to give me.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh.
Mark Brendanawicz,Have a beer with me.
Mark Brendanawicz,That guy was too young for you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay--
Mark Brendanawicz,"Keep it simple, nice shady trees, lots of grass, benches."
Mark Brendanawicz,Come here.
Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.
Mark Brendanawicz,Water feature.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Like, huge rocks to be climbing on."
Mark Brendanawicz,A play area for the kids.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that good?
Mark Brendanawicz,But then you'd be homeless.
Mark Brendanawicz,He really does.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that good?
Mark Brendanawicz,You don't have to.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! We're getting drinks to go."
Mark Brendanawicz,What are you doing?
Mark Brendanawicz,Perkins.
Mark Brendanawicz,Rack them up!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Please, tell me about this park that you badly need rezoned by me."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm actually headed right out the door.
Mark Brendanawicz,And I can do whatever I want.
Mark Brendanawicz,You should be dating guys in their early hundreds.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm telling you, you should be dating men that Al Roker announces their birthdays."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, fine."
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't make fun of me.
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you win, then you get Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,You did?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,I made a bump into a smaller bump.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you sure now?
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh I heard that you were gonna print some of that stuff that I said in private about the park.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I'm Pawnee Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I was gonna surprise her, take her to a nice restaurant."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you know, you got up because you had to write the article and I said, ""Come on, stay in bed."""
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"""That park is never, ever, ever gonna get made."""
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a great day for America.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't want you to take it the wrong way.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,It really was.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're over 21.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And so now, I work for Norton Construction."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, they offered me a buyout, and I took it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I think somebody from Animal Services is gonna get canned."
Mark Brendanawicz,Just out here.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Would you, please?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Thank you, Officer."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,Zero.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Let's just go home, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, if you don't mind, would you please just get out of my office?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's just go home.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Honestly, Leslie, it's gonna be a long, uphill battle."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I wish we could turn it into a pit, frankly, don't you?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"What's not to love about this park, right here, now?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Pro, we can fill in the pit."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, thank you."
Mark Brendanawicz,Whoa!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."
Mark Brendanawicz,This is way cleaner than the last time I was here.
Mark Brendanawicz,I can't wait to talk to Justin again.
Mark Brendanawicz,Last time he told me about how he snorkeled with whale sharks in Madagascar.
Mark Brendanawicz,That was after I told him that I sometimes go swimming at the Y.
Mark Brendanawicz,You are gonna be super annoyed with all the people that want you to fail.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you know about this?
Mark Brendanawicz,Right?
Mark Brendanawicz,Right here.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ron Swanson."
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You didn't happen to hear about the incident with Mayor Gunderson's dog, did you?"
Mark Brendanawicz,It's okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,So I got you all of them.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"""If a person is a man, turn to page two."""
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's just go home.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie--
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, here's the whole thing."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, you're asking me to do a bad job at my job, and I'm just not gonna do that."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know.
Mark Brendanawicz,He did.
Mark Brendanawicz,I really admire your tenacity.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you need a ride home?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I wouldn't say romantically involved."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Bye, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,You clearly didn't!
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, you didn't!"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, it's not that big a deal."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, shut up."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's nobody.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Here are all my skeletons.
Mark Brendanawicz,"When I was 16, I had sex with a married woman."
Mark Brendanawicz,"When I was in college, I smoked a decent amount of pot."
Mark Brendanawicz,Nothing insane.
Mark Brendanawicz,"There is a sea of red tape, endless roadblocks."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, yeah, I don't know."
Mark Brendanawicz,Good night.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Is there anything that you would like to share from your past, to sort of balance the scales?"
Mark Brendanawicz,This was a bad idea.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I would rather you not find out about this from anyone but me."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So my face is literally on fire, but it's this weird chemical, so no one can see the flames."
Mark Brendanawicz,Easy!
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm dancing around, freaking out."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I like you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"What I'm doing is, I'm trying to tell you that I've done some stuff that I'm not very proud of."
Mark Brendanawicz,Didn't happen to me.
Mark Brendanawicz,It was a kid I knew from camp.
Mark Brendanawicz,But a great story's a great story.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, plus, the kid can't tell it, his mouth melted."
Mark Brendanawicz,When I tell you what--
Mark Brendanawicz,I end up having to dunk my face into a bucket of sand.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,We caught a criminal.
Mark Brendanawicz,And keeping one's eyes open is always a good rule of thumb around guns.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's it.
Mark Brendanawicz,I just
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, there."
Mark Brendanawicz,"April, please stand behind me."
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't do that.
Mark Brendanawicz,I never should've done anything with that reporter.
Mark Brendanawicz,But you're being a huge dork.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, then I resign from your subcommittee."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's fun to pretend to be zoning board members.
Mark Brendanawicz,It was insane.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, how old are your kids?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Here, I'm gonna pretend to be Janine Restrepo."
Mark Brendanawicz,You're overthinking this.
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't worry.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why did I come to you for advice?
Mark Brendanawicz,That's all.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know what, it does look like he's breaking into that van."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's all we've got.
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely.
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
Mark Brendanawicz,"In fact, watch this."
Mark Brendanawicz,I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,Just... Watch what I'm going to do.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Wow, man."
Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.
Mark Brendanawicz,Nope.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, I will."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, but I'm not gonna do it again."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Damn!
Mark Brendanawicz,Drat!
Mark Brendanawicz,I was going to plan to notâ¦
Mark Brendanawicz,To say no.
Mark Brendanawicz,Just ask me in for a nightcap.
Mark Brendanawicz,Day bed?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, it's just a way to unwind, you know."
Mark Brendanawicz,What crowd?
Mark Brendanawicz,"And then Ann broke up with me the week that I was going to propose, the government got shut down, and yesterday one of those pigeons took a [bleep] on me."
Mark Brendanawicz,What about that thing you did for the middle school newspaper last year?
Mark Brendanawicz,But I felt like I needed a sign.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Recently, I had been thinking about maybe leaving this job."
Mark Brendanawicz,But it's actually very simple.
Mark Brendanawicz,Those aren't really my friends anymore.
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you wanna fill in the pit, just go fill it in."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I was indoors.
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, right there."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't hang out with them.
Mark Brendanawicz,Social activism.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, not everyone has your enthusiasm for this work."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm taking a half day off to come and help you out because you're my friend, so just shut up."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie Knope.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You've got Duck, Duck, Glass you could play right there."
Mark Brendanawicz,Mystery Trash.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, this is already a park! Look, I mean, you got Dirt Slide over here, you got Ring Around The Diaper you could play there."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, look."
Mark Brendanawicz,Soâ¦
Mark Brendanawicz,Would you break the rules?
Mark Brendanawicz,Would you be willing to come to a town meeting and show your support?
Mark Brendanawicz,Great.
Mark Brendanawicz,There used to be this huge speed bump in the center of town.
Mark Brendanawicz,Can I ask you another question?
Mark Brendanawicz,Where'd that come from?
Mark Brendanawicz,Loosen up.
Mark Brendanawicz,You could petition to expedite the Architecture Review Board process.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's good to know.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ron Swanson!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Can I talk to you outside really quick?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Man, I should have yelled at you way more."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yay.
Mark Brendanawicz,So you really wanna get this pit filled in?
Mark Brendanawicz,And you'll do whatever it takes?
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's do it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,Ron Swanson!
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a chicken salad sandwich.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow.
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, the band's really good."
Mark Brendanawicz,Bye.
Mark Brendanawicz,I checked it out like a month ago.
Mark Brendanawicz,It is.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, she's not."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know that's not your situation, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, you busy?"
Mark Brendanawicz,I liked that song Grapple Hound.
Mark Brendanawicz,"He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt."
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Mark Brendanawicz,Condo developer.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, Lot 48."
Mark Brendanawicz,I didn't clear anything.
Mark Brendanawicz,I love her.
Mark Brendanawicz,Have you not been listening to anything I just said?
Mark Brendanawicz,You tell me.
Mark Brendanawicz,These are amazing.
Mark Brendanawicz,I just work right there.
Mark Brendanawicz,And I want a partner.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I do."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Wait, what's that?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I know."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, how's the shoeshine game?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You owe me one, remember?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Also, Tom, your wife is super cool."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You don't have any code violations, do you?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Did you guys ever date?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Homeowners' associations, anti-government nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape--"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Tom."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You're making history, Knope."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Was that, uh, Justin?"
Mark Brendanawicz,There's like a million reasons why.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why?
Mark Brendanawicz,You've got hazardous chemicals over here.
Mark Brendanawicz,I would give up on that one.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not possible.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh get out. How long have you known him?
Mark Brendanawicz,Doesn't seem to be any ventilation.
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no drainage.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,"But, is it possible?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, can I run something by you really quick?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"A park, huh?"
Mark Brendanawicz,I feel like we should invite him inside.
Mark Brendanawicz,How long have you guys been dating?
Mark Brendanawicz,Cool.
Mark Brendanawicz,Awesome.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's pretty gross.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, well done."
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, none of this is up to code."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Thanks, a lot."
Mark Brendanawicz,But you'll be fine as long as you don't have any code violations.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, it is."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Sure, I just need to schedule an inspection."
Mark Brendanawicz,I really hit rock bottom that night.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Apparently, tonight, I'm the Parks Department's seventh wheel."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I mean that I literally fell to the bottom of a pit and hit a rock.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie is unique.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Andy, thank you for saying all that just now."
Mark Brendanawicz,Still no.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,This--
Mark Brendanawicz,"I remember laying there thinking, ""There's probably a good reason why I'm down here and single."""
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know how to say this.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I am so sorry, and I will do my best to visit you on holidays."
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm not doing anything, soâ¦"
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh What's with the hat?
Mark Brendanawicz,Those city planning guys can be real pains in the ass.
Mark Brendanawicz,I guess you're his now.
Mark Brendanawicz,I do.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, it's just It's raining outside, and he's living in a pit, you know?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Thought you could use some help.
Mark Brendanawicz,Bad idea?
Mark Brendanawicz,Good idea?
Mark Brendanawicz,And so I'm wondering if maybe I should ask her if she would like to move in with me.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, so I've been a little worried that Ann maybe thinks that our relationship isn't moving forward fast enough."
Mark Brendanawicz,I know.
Mark Brendanawicz,I feel like you're being sarcastic right now.
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's watch Marley and Me.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, in case I don't sink this, it's been a real pleasure dating you."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, if you don't wanna talk to me, you can just say so."
Mark Brendanawicz,Government work can beat you down.
Mark Brendanawicz,19 and a half.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you have any--
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ron, what's up?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't think so, man."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, kids."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't wanna get into this, really, but I don't beg for sex now."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's just not really my thing.
Mark Brendanawicz,Sorry?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I'm more than a friend of Ann's."
Mark Brendanawicz,Cindy.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, we actually kind of do."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,And you might wanna take these pictures down.
Mark Brendanawicz,You've made it abundantly clear that there's no romantic element to our relationship in any way.
Mark Brendanawicz,The new Deputy Director of the department is Tammy Swanson.
Mark Brendanawicz,I wanted to apologize to you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah, I hear you made two male penguins very happy today."
Mark Brendanawicz,You're Tom's wife.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And then I started thinking, ""I need morphine."""
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you... Do you put a little hot sauce on these or something?
Mark Brendanawicz,I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules."
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's do it.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie's kept hers for six years.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is she okay?
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi.
Mark Brendanawicz,I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, Andy."
Mark Brendanawicz,I like that.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, it's not likely, you know."
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no way it can happen.
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe we could leave a little later.
Mark Brendanawicz,What kind of music does your band play?
Mark Brendanawicz,Congratulations.
Mark Brendanawicz,"But you were right, and I should've listened to you."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I'll give you 24 hours."
Mark Brendanawicz,I need you to fix this place up.
Mark Brendanawicz,I intend to marry her.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, you can cut it out, now."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I don't need a canoe, Ron."
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe you should try to relax.
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,"25, 26, 27, 28 violations."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't understand.
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe take one of those Ativans I saw in the medicine cabinet.
Mark Brendanawicz,I just heard the news.
Mark Brendanawicz,There is a basket of oil soaked rags above a wood burning stove.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,"My only criticism, I hate the name of the band."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie.
Mark Brendanawicz,Should I come up now?
Mark Brendanawicz,What happened?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, can I talk to you for a minute?"
Mark Brendanawicz,It's been a great week.
Mark Brendanawicz,Say no more.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, well, this thing's kind of wrapping up."
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Becky and Stacy are boring.
Mark Brendanawicz,Good.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Nice work, Knope."
Mark Brendanawicz,Happy six month anniversary.
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely.
Mark Brendanawicz,Park's gonna get done.
Mark Brendanawicz,Can we talk privately?
Mark Brendanawicz,I am so swamped here.
Mark Brendanawicz,Can it wait?
Mark Brendanawicz,I would.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, it's a bummer."
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi!
Mark Brendanawicz,Ouch!
Mark Brendanawicz,He wouldn't?
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what you should do?
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not ideal.
Mark Brendanawicz,I was gonna suggest maybe you just go and talk to him.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're only gonna get more resentful if you don't.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think that's cool.
Mark Brendanawicz,Out of the mainstream.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Like, I don't know, anything weird or funny happen when you guys are showing people houses?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,How--
Mark Brendanawicz,"Any cool stories you got, huh?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie would like to talk to you for a moment.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that all right?
Mark Brendanawicz,It is.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, we did."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, hey, everyone."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I like you a lot as a dude.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not a done deal.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I might be crazy, but I have this weird suspicion that things are going well with us."
Mark Brendanawicz,"But you know, having never been in something like this before, I feel the need to ask, how am I doing?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I understand that this Ann situation is awkward."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, I'm sort of serious."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I sort of-- No, but yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, fine, forget it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm just saying, you know, it seems to me, on paper, that this thing we have is pretty great."
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And I just hope that there is some way that we can both be mature, and maybe be friends."
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, you know what?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, have you seen that documentary about food yet?"
Mark Brendanawicz,We're gonna be at Scully's if you two can tear yourselves away.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's gonna be okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I peeked."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's mostly like regulating things and just making sure people obey the city code.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,I also didn't see any toothpaste.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is punching allowed on the high road?
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you not use toothpaste?
Mark Brendanawicz,So you're with Andy now?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Sticking your neck out, you know."
Mark Brendanawicz,This says it should be recharged June of 1996.
Mark Brendanawicz,I tried to get her to pull some of those quotes and things got a little dicey.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, I do understand."
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm dating Ann.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, it's city planning."
Mark Brendanawicz,Thanks.
Mark Brendanawicz,I know.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's it?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Can I settle, please?"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, that makes sense."
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe you and Leslie can join us at the bar.
Mark Brendanawicz,We should go together.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't wanna freak you out, but another department filed a planning claim for Lot 48."
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, that's why you pulled your pants down."
Mark Brendanawicz,We're done?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, we did, like, five years ago."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Trip Holloway named names in the '50s.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Let's make the speech work for us.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Pawnee hospital was overrun with raccoons at the time.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Yes, it's true."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Honey.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You're not getting any younger.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Hi again.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,She's blowing us off.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, ""There's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother."""
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, I'm so proud of you."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That is so thoughtful of you.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It's not your fault that he turned out to be--
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"It was very thoughtful, sweetheart."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Horace Rangel used the police department to harass journalists.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"""Joseph Stalin dies""?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, it's okay."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"That's great, honey."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That is hilarious.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, that's a Knope woman for you."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"When we see something adorable, we attack it."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,This is gonna be a train wreck.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, let me mull everything over, and then we can reconnect and hash things out."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,He tried to resegregate the drinking fountains.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Let her know you know all about it, connect it to what you want, and then tell her if she doesn't help you, and soon, you're gonna tell everybody in town."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'm sorry.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"It might get rough, but that can be fun."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Ben can handle it.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"That took guts, mooning Joan Callamezzo! Aw! Honey!"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, I am very glad you came back up here."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, I met him on the Internet because of my lovely daughter, and we are compatible."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So make sure that you butter her up.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Did she say call her or call her secretary?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I love Calvin and Hobbes.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Compromise is usually a sign of weakness.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Did you expect me to give birth to you in an infested, disease filled room?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It was a pleasure.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Well Four buses.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Marlene.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Deal.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You try telling that little girl she's not from Pawnee.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I like this one.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Sweetheart, they only give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Okay, the two things you have going for you is your connection with me, of course, and the fact that Restrepo loves feeling important."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I certainly couldn't.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, she's totally blowing us off."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Okay, I didn't want to have to use this, but her husband got a DUl in Illinois last week."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So you were technically born in Eagleton.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"The DUl, Leslie."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Who cares?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, if I told you it was a date, you never would've gone."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Where did all this confidence come from all of a sudden?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So we had to go to the next closest hospital.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,He's a total pushover.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Bert Winfield was a blackmailer.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,No.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Those are eight of the nastiest, most diabolical people you could ever want to meet."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The queen of the zoning board?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"So, what do you want, Leslie?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Scrap the whole thing.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Frank.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, right, Leslie's new friend."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Look, champagne!"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And Jesus, honey."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Mmm.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That's it?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Really?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Five seconds ago.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"I'm being stonewalled by the board, and I'm hoping your office can help us out."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The county school district needs four new school buses.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Doorway is creepy.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, boy."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Sweetheart, this is lovely."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, let's see."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"In or out, Leslie."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And Dawn Krink slept her way to the top of the DMV.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Why do you ask, sweetheart?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It was 1968.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And on the first day, I went for a swim in the ocean."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"So, what's the big surprise?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,There you are.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Sure.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And I looked up at him and I said, ""I am now."""
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And he looked down at me and he said, ""Are you okay?"""
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I saw you survive that town hall meeting.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The next thing I felt were two very powerful arms whisking me to safety.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I can't believe it's really you.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I was 18 and our family went on a vacation to Bermuda.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,My gosh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,She's a little weasel.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That's really loud.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And she's trying to keep it quiet.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'll try to be there.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Then I'm confused, Ben, because you just told me it was."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You know how busy I am.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, Geez."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And I got caught in a very strong current.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You keep that up and you're gonna be figuring out what wall to put your own Tellenson Award on.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Hey My goodness.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You gonna try to check me into an old folks home?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Fun anecdote.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, my God."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"God, I miss that man."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And in the same bed.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, like any married couple, honey, your father and I fought occasionally, and sometimes he won the argument, and sometimes I won."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,He just stepped away for a second.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Uh, yeah."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"You're not serious, right?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Wow.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Yeah?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Hmm.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You wrote a speech?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"But usually, we forgot what we were arguing about and just had sex."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Look at you.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Anyway, the important thing is that we always ended up on the same team."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Just go back in there and finish the dinner.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'm a parent.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Looks like you got some shirt on your coffee.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"He's like a goofy, spineless jellyfish."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Tony Tellenson was the worst.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It's like the war of the Wyatts out there!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Salvatore usually does men.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,What about you? What do you do for a living?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Very odd guy, though."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I loved him!
Marshall Langman,"Good one, honey!"
Marshall Langman,"Eat 'em up, honey."
Marshall Langman,Fierce alert.
Marshall Langman,Um.
Marshall Langman,"We all have some crazy urges from time to time, but you just can't act on them."
Marshall Langman,You have to bury them way down deep inside.
Marshall Langman,And the other 15% are perverts.
Marshall Langman,Thank you.
Marshall Langman,"You have to say, ""Get out of here, you crazy urges!"
Marshall Langman,"Girl, you look like Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking had a baby and I love it."
Marshall Langman,This is
Marshall Langman,"You are not welcome in this brain of mine!"""
Marshall Langman,J.K. you guys.
Marshall Langman,Please forget everything this horrible woman has told you.
Marshall Langman,"This, that's happening here, is not allowed!"
Marshall Langman,I recommend you start reading at chapter three.
Marshall Langman,Word.
Marshall Langman,They agree.
Marshall Langman,"Listen, my wife and I do not feel that we're better off than a year ago because a year ago, this town was not a horrifying sex den where people could put their body parts anywhere they want with impunity."
Marshall Langman,Here's our educational pamphlet.
Marshall Langman,See?
Marshall Langman,"I'm Marshall Langman and I'm here to say that sex before marriage is never the way I waited till marriage and then some to do it if you decide to sin, you'll rue it!"
Marshall Langman,"Thank you, Chris."
Marshall Langman,See?
Marshall Langman,"This town is going to hell in a Gucci knockoff handbag, girl."
Marshall Langman,"Ladies and gentlemen, this vulgar sex show is over."
Marshall Langman,And deviant behavior in Pawnee is up a billion percent!
Marshall Langman,Yeah.
Marta,You got it.
Martin Housely,And I am not a crook.
Martin Housely,"From Pawnee's most bookable personality, Denise Yermley!"
Martin Housely,"Coming up, a very special video presentation called Even My Tongue is Fat: The Story of Pawnee."
Martin Housely,"But right now, to begin with, let's start things off in our telethon with a song."
Martin Housely,"Weird, wacky stuff."
Martin Kernston,"You were responsible for the Harvest Festival, right?"
Martin Kernston,"Leslie, I'm a frugal man."
Martin Kernston,The 'tails?
Martin Kernston,I don't like extravagance or showmanship.
Martin Kernston,"So if Entertainment 720 is the kind of business you trust, I'm afraid you and I don't share the same values."
Martin Kernston,Martin.
Martin Kernston,And it's what's made me a successful businessman.
Martin Kernston,That's why I cut my own hair.
Mayor Stice,"Well, I owe you guys an apology too."
Mayor Stice,"I, uh, had a little bad publicity lately, and frankly, it's still really easy to score points by bashing Wyatt."
Mayor Stice,"Again, this would all be way more satisfying if Ben was here."
Mayor Stice,"You know, if people found out I gave Wyatt the key to the city, I would never get re-elected."
Mayor Stice,So no.
Mayor Stice,"What are you doing there, Wyatt?"
Mayor Stice,"And much like the hopes and dreams of the people of Partridge, it melted away."
Mayor Stice,"Uhoh, the key was made of ice."
Mayor Stice,#NAME?
Mayor Stice,"What has he got, acute wimping out?"
Mayor Stice,Do you really expect me to believe that?
Mayor Stice,"Today we put those horribly painful memories behind us as we welcome back the mayor who made all of that possible, Ben Wyatt."
Mayor Stice,"But now, 20 years later, the city has finally healed from the festering wound of Ice Town."
Mayor Stice,"If it's so meaningful to him, then where is he?"
Mayor Stice,Sick?
Mayor Stice,Damn it!
Mayor Stice,"Boy, it's just a real shame it had to happen today of all days."
Mayor Stice,"Here to accept the key to the city of Partridge, because Mr. Wyatt is conveniently ill, is his wife Leslie Knope."
Mel,Why is that so hard to understand?
Mel,Is it?
Mel,"No, I'm not."
Mel,Who suck!
Mel,"So, your department banned me from attending games just because I yell ""you suck"" at the players!"
Mel,I'm not always up in arms about something.
Mel,I hate the one-at-a-time system!
Mel,Anyone knows that!
Mel,There are fireworks every night at midnight?
Mel,Why?
Mel,They're so much more sanitary than paper towels!
Mel,What are you?
Mel,Some kind of moron?
Mel,Why don't you have hand dryers in the park bathrooms?
Mel,You should go back where you came from.
Mel,That sentence was confusing!
Mel,You might as well be from China!
Mel,Tell us!
Mel,Because you're hiding something?
Mel,"No, I don't."
Men's Soccer Coach,That's sexist.
Men's Soccer Coach,Are you kidding?
Men's Soccer Coach,"""I was here first""?"
Men's Soccer Coach,Get lost!
Men's Soccer Coach,But we're scheduled for this time on this field.
Men's Soccer Coach,I would hardly call what he does coaching.
Michael Tansley,Thomas Jefferson grew hemp.
Michael Tansley,I agree.
Michael Tansley,You're worse than Ron.
Michael Tansley,Like you claimed my job?
Michael Tansley,"Let's just relax, smoke another J, and all calm down."
Michael Tansley,Yeah.
Michael Tansley,"By the way, it's ridiculous that pot is illegal."
Michael Tansley,It grows in the ground!
Michael Tansley,"I've planted marijuana in community gardens all over the city, and it hasn't hurt anyone!"
Michael Tansley,Classic David.
Michael Tansley,"Oh, stop it, stop taunting him."
Michael Tansley,"That makes sense to you, Ron?"
Michael Tansley,"Alcohol is legal, but pot isn't?"
Michael Tansley,That was the best part of the job.
Michael Tansley,It was the early '90s.
Michael Tansley,"Pencil pushing wasn't really my thing, but I did love the parks themselves."
Michael Tansley,"Oh, in a way."
Michael Tansley,"Well, I think you've done a wonderful job maintaining the parks."
Michael Tansley,"Yes, Ron, I am."
Michael Tansley,Yes.
Michael Tansley,"But also, it's ridiculous that marijuana is illegal."
Michael Tansley,"In fairness to me, it was a different time."
Michelle Obama,"That's right, and we need passionate people like you on our national parks."
Michelle Obama,Yeah.
Michelle Obama,"Well, you know how I feel about Chicago."
Michelle Obama,Good to meet you.
Michelle Obama,"Yeah, we work together a lot."
Michelle Obama,"He's helped me integrate the ""Let's Move"" program into our national parks you know, getting kids outside, rock climbing, hiking."
Michelle Obama,How you doing?
Michelle Obama,"Hey, Grant."
Michelle Obama,Change happens one person at a time.
Michelle Obama,Are you nodding because you agree with me?
Michelle Obama,"You know, they get hundreds of millions of visitors each year."
Michelle Obama,Well I hope you take the job.

Mike Bean,You want to be corporal... or warrior?
Mike Bean,Now I own one-third of the Portland trail blazers.
Mike Bean,"Right now we're kind of focused on, like, bigger cities, like Shreveport, Akron."
Mike Bean,"Ben, we don't like to say the word ""no""â¦"
Mike Bean,"We feel it's counterproductive to our creative mission, so, instead, let me say ""Nah, bro."""
Mike Bean,But maybe just turn it off before you go to sleep.
Mike Bean,"We're gonna go play some video games, and we want you to watch quietly."
Mike Bean,At this company.
Mike Bean,He's on Team Gryzzl now.
Mike Bean,"Hey, Leslie Knope."
Mike Bean,It's the home of the architect.
Mike Bean,Right here in town on that land.
Mike Bean,Let's talk.
Mike Bean,"Yes, there is."
Mike Bean,We hired his company to help plan and build our new Gryzzl campus.
Mike Bean,Later!
Mike Bean,"Hell yeah, pimp!"
Mike Bean,Have a seat.
Mike Bean,He's right.
Mike Patterson,"Welcome to Eagleton Now, with Mike Patterson."
Mike Patterson,"We're live ambushing Leslie Knope who's in the middle of a crass publicity stunt, shoving cameras cameras into the faces of these poor, injured victims."
Mike Patterson,"And I, for one, am sick of it."
Mike Patterson,Baseball?
Mike Patterson,Really?
Mike Patterson,"Because all we see is you talking to your friend, known Eagleton hater Jeremy Jamm."

Mike Patterson,"By skipping the Pie Mary, she's saying, ""Women who love their families are stupid."""
Mike Patterson,Hugging your children?
Mike Patterson,"Okay, take it easy."
Mike Patterson,Do you ever cook for your children?
Mike Patterson,"Oh, I'm just speculating here, but do you think that Leslie Knope's actions indicate that she actually hates her family?"
Mike Patterson,Pardon me.
Mike Patterson,I need to get through.
Mike Patterson,And who's even watching your children right now while you're out God only knows where?
Mike Patterson,Is that how you wanna play?
Mike Patterson,All right.
Mike Patterson,Oh!
Mike Patterson,Pardon me.
Mike Patterson,Leslie Knope's little stunt put three people in the hospital.

Mike Patterson,Mike Patterson here.
Mike Patterson,"Leslie, you made it pretty clear that you don't think homemaking is important."
Mike Patterson,Excuse me.
Mike Patterson,This bee incident is just the latest assault coming from the Pawnee side of this merger.
Millicent Gergich,"Mom, come on."
Millicent Gergich,"Nope, this won't take too long."
Millicent Gergich,Group hug.
Millicent Gergich,"You know, last summer I did a 50 mile bike ride for the red cross."

Millicent Gergich,"Chris, I'd like you to meet my fiance, Carl."
Millicent Gergich,We're eating.
Millicent Gergich,Okay.
Millicent Gergich,"Bye, dad."
Millicent Gergich,"He was the young rafting instructor all the girls were into, and I was the young rafting instructor all the guys were into And then we got together."

Millicent Gergich,Everything okay?
Miriam Gergich,love and joy come to you
Mitch Savner,Seems like things are a little chaotic.

Mitch Savner,I like the sound of that.
Mitch Savner,"So Mr. Haverford, let's get to it."
Mitch Savner,Could you repeat that?
Mitch Savner,Can I see a menu?
Mitch Savner,Bacon pillows.

Mitch Savner,For crying out loud!
Mitch Savner,You have no idea how to run a restaurant.
Mitch Savner,That's what makes businesses work-- passion!
Mitch Savner,Let's go!
Mitch Savner,"But I have to say, restaurants are incredibly risky."
Mitch Savner,It's not often that I see someone with your sparkle and passion.
Mitch Savner,"Why does that say ""dry cleaning chemical transactional holding company?"""
Mitch Savner,"See you tomorrow, partner."
Mitch Savner,"As always, I love your enthusiasm."
Mitch Savner,The extra publicity would've given us a nice boost.
Mitch Savner,Why don't you come to my office tomorrow and pitch me your hottest idea?
Mitch Savner,I have a feeling a bright guy like you has some ideas of his own.
Mitch Savner,But I'm also looking to invest in other ventures.
Mitch Savner,I'll sponsor your concert.
Mitch Savner,Make that 16.
Mitch Savner,Mitch Savner.

Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Yeah.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Uhoh, uhoh, uhoh."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Diddy's on Instagram?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"How did I not know that Diddy was on Instagram, you jagweeds?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,The jagweeds.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,It's like dating a cop.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Why are you still in front of me?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,My name is MonaLisa.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, if that's where the night is goingâ¦"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Wha--
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"You are so freaking sexy right now, I could crap my pants."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Move aside!

Nadia Stasky,"Yeah, no, I really like him."
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I just finished filling this one out."
Nadia Stasky,"I just wanted to say that I think you're really cool, and the fact that Tom dated you makes me think he's a really good guy."

Paul,Gee whiz.
Paul,Right.
Paul,I really want you to nail this.
Paul,Hey.
Paul,Thank you very much.

Paul,Indefinitely.
Paul,I guess.
Paul,"Look, we are bordering on a full-blown crisis, Leslie."
Paul,Chocolate pudding.
Paul,No.
Paul,She's filibustering her own meeting.
Paul,"My, God."

Paula Horke,"Well, it's not a handkerchief."
Paula Horke,Government was a real boys' club back in the '70s.
Paula Horke,"Well it's a pleasure to be here, ladies."
Paula Horke,"I once tried to start a commission to try to get more jobs for women in city government, and they dismissed me, saying that it was because it was just my time of the month."
Paula Horke,Because of the calendar.
Paula Horke,It's a receipt.
Paula Horke,I didn't think anybody really cared about my time on the city council.
Paula Horke,"They smoked their cigars, they snapped my bra, wore mirrors on their shoes to look up my skirt."
Pearl,"Actually, I'm gonna need that back."
Pearl,"It's extremely rare, and I am keeping it."
Pearl,Except now all of you people.
Pearl,"But still, they have no right to give me something I will treasure the rest of my life."
Pearl,They sent me a bunch of toy pigs dressed like movie stars.
Pearl,This is actually Hamuel L. Jackson from the movie Pork Fiction.
Pearl,No one knows I collect toy pigs dressed like movie stars.
Pearl,That's my private hobby.

Perd Hapley,Welcome to The Final Word With Perd.
Perd Hapley,"Ms. Pinewood, there is a thing you are doing, and that thing is you are leading a recall vote against Councilwoman Knope, and you say you have new, shocking allegations about her."
Perd Hapley,Wow.
Perd Hapley,The thing we return to now is my Johnny Karate Show return message.
Perd Hapley,It's Judge Perd.
Perd Hapley,That's a hilarious image.
Perd Hapley,How did she close the gap?
Perd Hapley,Case ended.
Perd Hapley,Let's take a look.
Perd Hapley,Pawnee's raccoon infestation.
Perd Hapley,Absolutely sure?
Perd Hapley,"Perd Hapley, Channel Four Eyewitness News."
Perd Hapley,It turns out Councilman Dexhart may have also had sex with a prostitute in the limousine on the way to and from the press conference where he apologized for having an affair.
Perd Hapley,"Too close to call, a real nailbiter, anybody's game"

Perd Hapley,"Perd Hapley, Channel Four News."
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, for our viewers at home who might not know, are centaurs real?"
Perd Hapley,And our flash poll seems to agree.
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, your poll is designed to choose a new slogan."
Perd Hapley,Are you okay?
Perd Hapley,Welcome to Ya' Heard?
Perd Hapley,The story of this story is that it won't stop developing.
Perd Hapley,Okay.
Perd Hapley,Pawnee voters have decisively removed Leslie Knope
Perd Hapley,Also joining us today is a different person.
Perd Hapley,Have these little bandits stolen our sense of safety?
Perd Hapley,"Half woman, half horse, with what some would say are human breasts."
Perd Hapley,You are the subject of this painting.
Perd Hapley,and it's razor thin and getting razor thinner.
Perd Hapley,And dirt and rust and even broken glass.
Perd Hapley,With Perd.
Perd Hapley,"And 100% of Pawneeans are ""perdverts."""
Perd Hapley,That's the name I call fans of this show based on the fact that my name is Perd.
Perd Hapley,"It's a heartwarming story, but it's just not believable."
Perd Hapley,"We'll see you after the break, perdverts."
Perd Hapley,"There is such a thing as journalistic integrity, and it is something that I have as a journalist with integrity."
Perd Hapley,Tell me a little bit about Leslie Knope.
Perd Hapley,"The plaintiff, Leslie Knope, who has some big allegations against Gryzzl."
Perd Hapley,The mystery woman who met with Councilman Dexhart last night appears to be a government employee named Leslie Norp.
Perd Hapley,"Now, Jen, what are your thoughts about all of this?"
Perd Hapley,Thank you very much.
Perd Hapley,"The defendant, Gryzzl Vice President Roscoe Santangelo."
Perd Hapley,The lewd photo just how big a deal is it?
Perd Hapley,"Well, you had some time when I started talking, but by the time I finished, your time was up."
Perd Hapley,I'm about to ask you a question right now and that question is this.
Perd Hapley,And I would just like an empty glass.
Perd Hapley,Who will win?
Perd Hapley,"Tonight on The Perdples Court, we will have the guests that have been booked for tonight's show."
Perd Hapley,"For a female perspective on this scandal, we turn to a woman, Leslie Knope."
Perd Hapley,The story of that commercial break is it's over.
Perd Hapley,Which is what makes this a court show.
Perd Hapley,"Well, we conducted a Perd poll and asked this question: not be in Europe, and 35% said they were confused by the way the question was posed."
Perd Hapley,"""Now listen to some words from our sponsors"" are the words I'm saying right now."
Perd Hapley,"Now, this painting right here, art or pornography?"
Perd Hapley,Ben Wyatt and Tom Haverford.
Perd Hapley,That's going to be a pretty big roller coaster.
Perd Hapley,Extremely well put.
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, what exactly does ""censure"" mean?"
Perd Hapley,"Well, I don't know the answer to that, Jennifer, but your tone makes me think Yes."
Perd Hapley,You have 20 seconds.
Perd Hapley,When did you get into the business?
Perd Hapley,I don't know yet.
Perd Hapley,I don't know what you mean.
Perd Hapley,"Well, the story of that appeal is it was heartfelt."
Perd Hapley,"And in response to that appeal, I respond: Okay."
Perd Hapley,Is that what happened?
Perd Hapley,I've also misplaced my judge hammer.
Perd Hapley,"And, Leslie Knope, closing statement?"
Perd Hapley,"Now it's time to move onto our next segment, which is a commercial."
Perd Hapley,Will that be enough to lift the curse?
Perd Hapley,Let's begin the show by starting it.
Perd Hapley,"Brandi, you've starred in over 200 adult films, some of which are very good."
Perd Hapley,"Now, Leslie, you claim the Newport campaign stole one of your ideas."
Perd Hapley,Stick around.
Perd Hapley,"Yeah, the statement that this reporter has is a question."
Perd Hapley,I cannot render a verdict here.
Perd Hapley,"To be honest, Judge Perd is stumped by this case."
Perd Hapley,Welcome back to the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show.
Perd Hapley,"Wow, strong words from a powerful lady."
Perd Hapley,"We're gonna be back with our closing statements right after a word from our sponsor, Sweetums, Pawnee's biggest supplier of candy and jobs."
Perd Hapley,"I'm sorry, Miss Knope."
Perd Hapley,"I am not here to declare a winner, but Jennifer is the winner."
Perd Hapley,"It's been neck in neck, too close to call all night, but now we're ready to make a call in the race for city council."
Perd Hapley,But it had the cadence of a joke.
Perd Hapley,But this is where the controversy of this story gets even more controversial.
Perd Hapley,Bobby Newport
Pete Disellio,I'm excited to be here.
Pete Disellio,"Look, everywhere I go, everybody wants me to talk about that dunk, and that game."
Pete Disellio,Aww.
Pete Disellio,"Hi, Pete Disellio."
Pete Disellio,Yeah.
Pete Disellio,"Of course, my father, he was more stick than carrot when it came to matters of discipline."
Pete Disellio,I prefer Pete.
Pete Disellio,I teach marketing over at Pawnee Community College.
Pete Disellio,When will women in this town stop scheming to get my sperm?
Pete Disellio,You want my sperm.
Pete Disellio,I see what's going on here.
Pete Disellio,"It's nice to see you again, Ann."
Pete Disellio,"You know, I'm a lot more than just a former high school basketball star."
Pete Disellio,"She's got a great team behind her, and a vote for her is a slam dunk."
Pete Disellio,"Oh, thanks."
Pete Disellio,"It sure will be! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Pistol Pete, and around here, I'm a Pawnee legend! I just wanted to say that I fully endorse Leslie Knope."
Pete Disellio,I was happy to get the call.
Pete Disellio,That's what life is like in a strict Roman Catholic household.
Pete Disellio,"Oh, I can, but I won't."
Pete Disellio,You could let me take you to dinner.
Pete Disellio,"I said ""No."""
Pete Disellio,"Thanks, guys."
Pete Disellio,When is this town gonna realize that I'm more than a former high school basketball star?
Pete Disellio,It feels like I'm living in the past.
Pete Disellio,"It's called ""Sweetums dunktastic threepoint Bball blast"" the slogan is ""It's all about basketball."""
Pete Disellio,"I'm sorry, you're gonna have to find yourself some other famous pawneean."
Pete Disellio,They want me dunking on the label.
Pete Disellio,"You've done great stuff for our parks system and I will happily endorse you As Peter Disellio, regional distributor for Derwin ham loafs, but if this is about who I was, or what I did when I was 17, I'm out of here."
Pete Disellio,Okay.
Pete Disellio,I'm not going to dunk the ball.
Pete Disellio,"It, that's nice."
Pete Disellio,"Yeah, well, being a living legend is sort of a doubleedged sword."
Pete Disellio,"Look, Leslie, I read up on you."
Pete Disellio,They already tried to get me to endorse that sports drink.
Pete Disellio,"Everybody in this town still calls me ""Pistol."""
Pete Disellio,"I mean, yes, that dunk, it made me famous, but sometimes Sometimes life dunks you."
Phil,Is Wendy one of the teachers?
Phil,Were you aware that all of the entertainment and food was provided by rec center teachers?
Phil,"I don't know, would you have?"
Phil,This has all been on the record.
Phil,And we will determine whether you are guilty of abusing your power.
Phil,Do you have anything to say before we begin?
Phil,No.
Phil,Ron Swanson will be next.
Phil,We've reached our decision.
Phil,Did you hear Leslie make any promises?
Phil,"Why is he here, Miss Knope?"
Phil,"Okay, Leslie."
Phil,"We're going to take a break, and we'll let you know what we decide in about an hour."
Phil,Okay.
Phil,It really helped that you asked for this hearing yourself.
Phil,And that you made financial restitution out of your own pocket.
Phil,But I think we both know you skirted a line here.
Phil,I wouldn't have.
Phil,"I promise you, Miss Knope, this disciplinary committee will go over every detail of what happened last night."
Phil,We're not going to take any further action at this time.
Phil,"So, you don't work for the government and you had no idea that these people were teachers from the local rec center?"
Phil,"Thank you, Ron."
Phil,Okay.
Phil,A quid pro quo.
Phil,I was simply attending a dinner party at my friend's house.
Phone,9-1-1.
Phone Voice,Please stay on the line.
Phone Voice,"Hello, you have reached the Indiana State Parks Department."
Phone Voice,Your call is very important to us.
Police Officer,What the hell is this?
Police Officer,Wait.
Police Officer,"Andy, on behalf of the entire Pawnee Police Department, I'd like to present you with this genuine Pawnee police badge."
Police Officer,He got my cuffs.
Police Officer,That's Dwyer.
Police Officer,"I want to make it clear, he's not."
Police Officer,He's not.
Police Officer,Quit it!
Police Officer,It's an honorary title.
Police Officer,"No, no."
Police Officer,DWYER.
Police Officer,Are you trying to lure this young lady into your van?
Police Officer,"When we write official reports, we refrain from using words like ""jerk"" or ""awesome."
Police Officer,"I need to see your hands and could you step out of the vehicle, please?"
Police Officer,"Well, you got four people in the front seat, nobody's wearing a seat belt, you were speeding and blasting your horn through the hospital zone, the rear of the vehicle's open, debris has been falling out, and you don't have a commercial license to drive a truck."
Police Officer,"Yeah, that really wasn't an option."
Police Officer,Fine.
Police Officer,"But unless one of you has a commercial license, you can't take that truck."
Police Officer,What's wrong with you?
Police Officer,"They broke about 50 laws, Knope."
Police Officer,That's not appropriate.
Police Officer,The guy said he might press charges.
Police Officer,"And that girl, she tried to get that gimp dog to bite me."
Principal Russell,"I have your word, then."
Principal Russell,You haven't changed since high school.
Principal Russell,"Oh-ho, Leslie."
Principal Russell,May I see both of you in my office?
Principal Russell,This is Aplus work.
Principal Russell,We just wouldn't have had a prom without you.
Principal Russell,"Leslie, thanks again."
Principal Russell,Thank you.

Ragiv,I'm Ragiv from I.T.
Ragiv,It does all the scheduling in Eagleton.

Ragiv,"What is this, 1990?"
Ragiv,Hi.
Randall,"And that's why we'll be debuting our new healthy energy bar, NutriYums."
Randall,"Although candy is our bread and butter, we also care about the health of our customers."
Randall,I guess that about says it all.
Randall,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nick Newport, Jr.!"
Randall,"Corn syrup is natural, and it's fine in moderation."
Randall,Take a look.
Randall,But don't take my word for it.
Randall,And we are so excited about our new partnership with the Parks Department.
Randall,Sweetums has been Pawnee's leading sweet treat manufacturer for over 80 years.
Randy,"So, we think we can keep costs down and still meet deadlines."
Randy,"And I have to warn you, there will be a confirmation hearing."
Randy,She had an affair with his best friend.
Randy,"So, Leslie, I was going to talk to you about this in a few weeks, but Mike Norbert is retiring."
Randy,Is she going to be okay?
Randy,We're meeting with a lot of senators today.
Randy,His marriage is falling apart.
Randy,"You'd have to move to D.C., , and you'd have to complete the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program."
Randy,"Even though I'm taking the lead on these meetings, don't be afraid to jump in."
Randy,Yeah.
Randy,I get it.
Randy,I get it.
Randy,"So, anyway."
Randy,"Good news for you is, we'd like to promote you to Deputy Director of Operations at Interior."
Randy,"Okay, I think we're all set."
Raul,We just think that you are weak and your city is disgusting.
Raul,"I see what you're getting at, but no, thank you."
Raul,Journalists?
Raul,Venezuela is blessed with massive oil reserves.
Raul,Do not disrespect Chavez.
Raul,"Look, this is not personal."
Raul,Their town is far nicer.
Raul,Where are they?
Raul,Pay no attention to him.
Raul,American children are fattened more efficiently than any other children in the world.
Raul,You are right to want to correct this.
Raul,It is a gift.
Raul,I already know who wins Project Runway.
Raul,Jail.
Raul,"I mean, they're huge, little porkers."
Raul,Right away.
Raul,Jail.
Raul,"Well, now that you ask, we usually rotate as well between different fortresses and citadels, and palaces."
Raul,I do not understand.
Raul,I am still primarily interested in the large black woman.
Raul,This kind of behavior is never tolerated in Boraqua.
Raul,Good meeting.
Raul,This is a gold plated replica of the gun Hugo Chavez used in the 1992 Socialist revolution.
Raul,We will see you later today at the photo opportunity.
Raul,This is where you have your meetings?
Raul,"No trial, no nothing."
Raul,"He is our intern, Johnny."
Raul,"Massive, I mean, tremendous, like, you would not believe."
Raul,Oil is food for cars.
Raul,"And Elvis Correja, Administrator of Hedges."
Raul,"Okay, gracias."
Raul,"Venezuela, Venezuela, my country, has a lot of oil."
Raul,"Yes, yes, yes."
Raul,"There's so much soul and life everywhere! Every little tiny street, so much culture, and history! And the cars! People really take care of their cars there."
Raul,"Yes, it is to fill your pit to start to build a park."
Raul,Please.
Raul,Hey!
Raul,We were very tired from our long journey.
Raul,Slow?
Raul,"In Boraqua, the government moves like a hot knife through butter."
Raul,I feel my English was very clear.
Raul,"I mean, they're like little basketballs."
Raul,"Just gorgeous, everything."
Raul,This is an embarrassment to America.
Raul,"These are my colleagues, Antonio Rivera-Fonseca, Minister of Small Fountains."
Raul,No? Okay.
Raul,"I mean, you have to see this place Miami."
Raul,"Not as this here, listening to people yelling, these fat faces turning all red?"
Raul,"You shout like that, they put you in jail."
Raul,"We're also sister cities with Kaesong, North Korea."
Raul,And I think we're good here.
Raul,"You notice that and they're a little older, but still just beautiful."
Raul,I like to party.
Raul,We have a special jail for journalists.
Raul,It's a pleasure to meet you.
Raul,Yes.
Raul,The parks in Boraqua are far superior.
Raul,"It's funny because Antonio said to me, ""Can we turn this car around and say we're sick or something, or that we lost our way?"""
Raul,We build tunnels through them.
Raul,"Believe it or not, jail, right away."
Raul,Right to jail.
Raul,Great.
Raul,What is this?
Raul,"That's worth one ""viva."""
Raul,Our trees are huge.
Raul,Yes! Viva Chavez!
Raul,We are quite tired from our trip.
Raul,He is worthless.
Raul,No wonder nothing ever gets done in this country.
Raul,"The state sells the oil, and keeps all the money, and we build whatever we want."
Raul,I have everything in Venezuela.
Raul,"Yes, it does."
Raul,"You undercook fish, believe it or not, jail."
Raul,It will be a good video.
Raul,Ah!
Raul,We don't even need them.
Raul,Finally.
Raul,"You're charging too high prices for sweaters, glasses, you right to jail."
Raul,You peel.
Raul,"Yes, you do!"
Raul,We didn't.
Raul,It is Hugo Chavez's passion project.
Raul,"And the food, so spicy and wonderful."
Raul,They've been partying with Dwyane Wade.
Raul,You're stealing?
Raul,Where are the armed men who come in to take the protesters away?
Raul,"We're shutting up, yeah."
Raul,Here we go.
Raul,We walk down the street and they treat us like rock stars.
Raul,"If you don't mind, we would like to take a video of you to show our superiors."
Raul,We answer to nobody.
Raul,Ah! Leslie! Hello.
Raul,You make an appointment with the dentist and you don't show up?
Raul,Do you have the check that we gave to you?
Raul,It's huge.
Raul,"The park in my hometown, El parque del Este, we have a monorail, and we have an aquarium, and we have the Jaripa Amphitheater."
Raul,"Okay, you're gonna show it to the camera and say how much it is and what it is for."
Raul,How generous!
Raul,"Undercook, overcook."
Raul,"Now say ""Viva Venezuela!"""
Raul,"You overcook chicken, also jail."
Raul,This is outrageous.
Raul,Viva Chavez!
Raul,"So, no women?"
Raul,"""Viva Chavez!"" Say it!"
Raul,Yeah.
Raul,Do you have some kind of book with photos of the women available to us?
Raul,But Pawnee is really good as well.
Raul,Right.
Raul,"We just gave you 35,000 dollars."
Raul,"If not, I will also take the sexy black one."
Raul,"Could you have your servant collect our bags, please?"
Raul,We could not even believe it.
Raul,And do not disrespect him.
Raul,"Yes, you do."
Raul,Chickens.
Raul,"We have the best patients in the world, because of jail."
Raul,You are no longer our sister.
Raul,For your troubles.
Raul,"We get 14,000 channels."
Raul,Right to jail.
Raul,Fourteen thousand.
Raul,"Of course, that would be rude to you."
Raul,Right away.
Raul,I just told you not to disrespect him.
Raul,"Really, really sad stuff."
Raul,Shall I repeat?
Raul,And we too are pleased to be here in your dirty alleyway.
Raul,You're driving too fast?
Raul,"In any case, I made a few phone calls, and the government of Venezuela has authorized a special gift for you."
Raul,"We haven't been here for a very long time, but what we have seen is, really, from the bottom of our hearts, truly depressing."
Raul,"With your hands, you peel the banana."
Raul,"I'm Vice Director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departamento de Parques, Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Maldonado."
Raul,Yes.
Raul,The one you want to turn into a park?
Raul,Are you kidding me?
Raul,That's twice.
Raul,You have offended the government of Boraqua.
Raul,"This is the giant pit of dirt you were telling us about, is it not?"
Raul,We're like kings!
Raul,And we just had an idea.
Raul,I have four satellite dishes on my estate.
Raul,"In our country, government officials drink only bottled water."
Raul,Excellent.
Raul,Gracias senor.
Raul,"Why don't you call the park after Chavez? You know, you call it Hugo Chavez Park."
Raul,"Well, we are sorry as well."
Raul,"And you can have a nice, big fountain of his head, so that when the water is coming out he is spitting at you all the time."
Raul,No.
Raul,They sent us all these photos and QuickTime files.
Raul,You're playing music too loud?
Raul,You should write this down.
Raul,"Really, really nice."
Raul,You have offended us.
Raul,"Bottled, please."
Raul,Send the boy.
Raul,"We thank you for the container of sap, and the bag of garbage."
Ray Holstead,Hello.
Ray Holstead,Fine.
Ray Holstead,"Ray Holstead, Ray's Sandwich Place."
Ray Holstead,"I have to say, Leslie does make a good point."
Ray Holstead,Trish is not the brightest bulb in the bunch.
Realtor,It's still on.
Realtor,"This one is 425 a month, plus utilities."
Realtor,"So, what do you think?"
Rebecca Varuvian,That proposal was brilliantly written.
Rebecca Varuvian,"Liam's being withholding, as usual."
Rebecca Varuvian,My God.
Rebecca Varuvian,Yes?
Rebecca Varuvian,What poster?
Reggie Wayne,"I did, Leslie."
Reggie Wayne,But I respect that.
Reggie Wayne,That's weird.
Reporter,Any comment on the report that you're running for Congress?
Reporter,Your only experience in politics was as a failed mayor at age 18.
Reporter,I mean what qualifies you to take over Hartwell's seat?
Reporter,What kind of a statement are you making by skipping it?
Reporter,Mister Wyatt.
Reporter,Your campaign released a schedule.
Reporter,And it looks like your wife is skipping the Pie Mary.
Reporter,Care to explain?
Reporter,Ben Wyatt.
Reporter,Leslie would be the first candidate's wife not to enter the Pie Mary.
Rita Ludgate,"Could you take your shoes off, please?"
Rita Ludgate,"Larry, who is it?"
Rita Ludgate,She's probably on the Internet again!
Rita Ludgate,I'll fetch her.
Rita Ludgate,"Oh, okay."
Rita Ludgate,Okay.
Rita Ludgate,What can I get you to drink? Ooh.
Rita Ludgate,"Come in, for gosh sake."
Rita Ludgate,Thank you so much.
Rita Ludgate,"Oh, you have no idea how nice it is to meet you."
Rita Ludgate,Rita Ludgate.
Rita Ludgate,"Oh, Ron."
Rita Ludgate,Okay.
Rivers,I'm sick of all the drama with this band.
Rivers,I'm going back to rabbinical school.
Rivers,To play in a band like Mouse Rat that brought such joy to so many was... Truly was a mitzvah.
Rivers,"I should mention, I'm a rabbi now."
Rivers,I quit.
Robert Mathis,"What's up, girl?"
Ron Dunn,You're surrendering to the Earth Mother.
Ron Dunn,"Now, stare into the fire and picture your spirit animal."
Ron Dunn,Baby snow owl.
Ron Dunn,Our spirit animals connect us to the natural world.
Ron Dunn,"Well, hello, gentlemen."
Ron Dunn,You need to remain open to their message.
Ron Dunn,It's like Moz once said.
Ron Dunn,What brings you out on this fine evening?
Ron Dunn,"""Hold on to your friends."""
Ron Dunn,Morrissey.
Ron Dunn,Ron.
Ron Dunn,"I agree with Ron, Leslie."
Ron Dunn,That was beautiful.
Ron Dunn,All depends on whether your conception of time is linear or circular.
Ron Dunn,"Hello, Ron."
Ron Dunn,I play for the Super Spinners.
Ron Dunn,"Oh, yeah."
Ron Dunn,I'm sure our souls have collided in one lifetime or another.
Ron Dunn,"Every time we lose a compadre, our collective lantern gets a little bit dimmer."
Ron Dunn,The thirst only grows worse.
Ron Dunn,Death makes brothers of us all.
Ron Dunn,I sure am sorry about your loss.
Ron Dunn,Let's role play.
Ron Dunn,"You're hanging onto that anger for dear life, compadre."
Ron Dunn,I couldn't help but overhear.
Ron Dunn,Oh.
Ron Dunn,"So, what's got your goat there, friend?"
Ron Dunn,They believed it had mystical powers.
Ron Dunn,"The Wamapoke called it ""mattapiqua."""
Ron Dunn,That's a good start.
Ron Dunn,I can tell by the indigo on your Chiclet that you've been drinking blueberry wine.
Ron Dunn,"Nice to see you, Ron."
Ron Dunn,"I've always found that when my soul aches with loss, it's best to turn to Eastern wisdom."
Ron Dunn,"In my experience, the only ""constant"" is change."
Ron Dunn,Nobody.
Ron Dunn,"Whenever my hair feels it has completed its journey, it simply sheds itself off."
Ron Dunn,"And I love you, my brother."
Ron Dunn,Dunn.
Ron Dunn,"Uh, that's a complicated question."
Ron Dunn,Am I?
Ron Dunn,Watch.
Ron Dunn,"Welcome back, old friend."
Ron Dunn,"As long as that new town were open to the ideals of communal living, everyone pitches in towards a common good."
Ron Dunn,"In the immortal words of Cat Stevens, ""If you want to be free, be free."""
Ron Dunn,You've already emerged from your cocoon.
Ron Dunn,Giving in to hate is like drinking saltwater.
Ron Dunn,"Now the question is, will you fly?"
Ron Dunn,"Ah, cool."
Ron Dunn,Yerba matte tea.
Ron Dunn,Same goes for all chickens.
Ron Dunn,Sweetened with stevia.
Ron Dunn,No need to curse.
Ron Dunn,"Whatever you do, I won't fight back."
Ron Dunn,"That's awful kind of you, Leslie, but I'm afraid those are a little too sweet for me."
Ron Dunn,I unhooked from that big sugar train over 30 years ago.
Ron Dunn,"Taurus and Capricorns never mix, do they? Just remember, Ron."
Ron Dunn,Fair enough.
Ron Dunn,I should have seen it.
Ron Dunn,It's an allnatural plant extract.
Ron Dunn,I believe a man's feet should remain uncaged.
Ron Dunn,"Oh, come on."
Ron Dunn,Slowly working toward full freegan vegan.
Ron Dunn,You're safe now.
Ron Dunn,My trusty sandals.
Ron Dunn,"There, there, baby snow owl."
Ron Dunn,You sure? This thing runs on vegetable oil and bat guano.
Ron Dunn,Actually cleans the air as it drives.
Ron Dunn,You don't know Meat Is Murder? It's one of the best songs ever written about industrialized beef consumption.
Ron Dunn,"If you really want to cleanse yourself of that anger, take that check and send it into the flames."
Ron Dunn,"Well, I love the outdoors, love nature."
Ron Dunn,And up into the air with your screams.
Ron Dunn,Recycling and composting and the like.
Ron Dunn,I'm a yoga nut.
Ron Dunn,And I'm a nut nut.
Ron Dunn,"They make delicious milks, man."
Ron Dunn,"And I'm a vegan, of course."
Ron Dunn,I'm a big believer in environmental conservation.
Ron Dunn,The Smiths.
Ron Swanson,That is what has happened.
Ron Swanson,I'm only gonna ask you this once.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,It's just like my brother's.
Ron Swanson,What is going on with my birthday?
Ron Swanson,He's an officer in the Air Force.
Ron Swanson,"Perhaps we could skip ahead, and just hit the highlights?"
Ron Swanson,Bacon wrapped shrimp.
Ron Swanson,I wasn't offering.
Ron Swanson,That's all I have to say.
Ron Swanson,You can't hack into a typewriter.
Ron Swanson,"No, Ann's right."
Ron Swanson,"Now, to most people, this story would seem boring."
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,"Well, looks like there won't be any balloons for the birthday boy."
Ron Swanson,I am lineman for the county and the Wichita lineman Is still the line
Ron Swanson,"My office, now."
Ron Swanson,I'm all for that.
Ron Swanson,Don't care.
Ron Swanson,We're a team.
Ron Swanson,I would like to volunteer to do the park survey myself.
Ron Swanson,I would never be able to find a worse assistant.
Ron Swanson,Mine is right here.
Ron Swanson,There is no street parking at my house.
Ron Swanson,That's called a conversation.
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, that's enough!"
Ron Swanson,Good gravy.
Ron Swanson,How much did you pay for this?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you should know by now that I live my life according to a certain set of principles, and I do not deviate from them."
Ron Swanson,Let's get Annabel Bloosh person.
Ron Swanson,"If Leslie is going for a hook, we should, too."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you little sneak."
Ron Swanson,"It's a bold capitalistic gambit, son."
Ron Swanson,"But nothing ventured, nothing gained."
Ron Swanson,Good God.
Ron Swanson,"Terry, what's Leslie up to?"
Ron Swanson,I do not.
Ron Swanson,Thank you for my new silver-backed friend.
Ron Swanson,I like him very much.
Ron Swanson,"I will call him ""9,000 dollars of taxpayer money the gorilla."""
Ron Swanson,Fair enough.
Ron Swanson,I just don't want to lose April.
Ron Swanson,"No, I don't care about their relationship."
Ron Swanson,Give me the list.
Ron Swanson,That woman really knows her way around a penis.
Ron Swanson,I'll help you.
Ron Swanson,"So, what's Leslie up to?"
Ron Swanson,You may think so.
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Ron Swanson,And the metaphor you chose was planting ficuses in your front yard?
Ron Swanson,You're welcome.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,I don't know the names of the other department heads.
Ron Swanson,Nice to meet you.
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron.
Ron Swanson,You must be April's sister.
Ron Swanson,"It's like doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours."
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Go.
Ron Swanson,No more delays.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,It's been nice talking to you.
Ron Swanson,"Go, Ann."
Ron Swanson,"Good luck, you two."
Ron Swanson,When will this be over?
Ron Swanson,Is April around?
Ron Swanson,"Nothing to drink, thanks."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Mr. Ludgate."
Ron Swanson,Nice try.
Ron Swanson,You don't work for me.
Ron Swanson,"I'm not telling you how much money I have, where it's hidden, or which precious metals and/or gemstones it may or may not take the form of."
Ron Swanson,She screwed up my entire life today.
Ron Swanson,She quit on me.
Ron Swanson,You might want to check her house.
Ron Swanson,"Chris, Ann wants to ask you something right now."
Ron Swanson,Okay?
Ron Swanson,"Time to go, sir."
Ron Swanson,"Our marriage was always a complete disaster, but we did have that."
Ron Swanson,I know Tom has been losing to me on purpose.
Ron Swanson,"On the other hand, this is a pretty sweet-ass gun."
Ron Swanson,"It would be an honor, and the first time I won't regret walking down the aisle."
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, Deputy."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Wendy."
Ron Swanson,"Well, you and Tom really turned the party around."
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, get in here now! Your work is appreciated."
Ron Swanson,But I like Tom.
Ron Swanson,I'd hate for you to have to go back to Canada.
Ron Swanson,All that socialized medicine up there.
Ron Swanson,He doesn't do a lot of work around here.
Ron Swanson,He shows zero initiative.
Ron Swanson,He's not a team player.
Ron Swanson,He's never one to go that extra mile.
Ron Swanson,No worries.
Ron Swanson,Tom is exactly what I'm looking for in a government employee.
Ron Swanson,Eat some corn.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, that's good."
Ron Swanson,That gorilla was a gift from a very determined co-worker whom I respect.
Ron Swanson,And there's a certain code of honor that accompanies gift-giving.
Ron Swanson,"Well, since we had to jettison the bulk of the wood, this is the biggest I could make it."
Ron Swanson,Did you try [bleep]?
Ron Swanson,I think I might be able to help you.
Ron Swanson,""" The first letter of the name of each mural with a heart on it will spell out the clue."
Ron Swanson,Nice party.
Ron Swanson,Or some or something.
Ron Swanson,"Politically, no, I don't support Chavez."
Ron Swanson,"Knope, follow me."
Ron Swanson,I despise him and everything that he does.
Ron Swanson,Now!
Ron Swanson,Son.
Ron Swanson,That is one hell of a costume.
Ron Swanson,Let's check out the murals.
Ron Swanson,I'm a simple man.
Ron Swanson,That seems like an invasion of privacy.
Ron Swanson,So it learns information?
Ron Swanson,Wait.
Ron Swanson,I figured it out.
Ron Swanson,"The letters unscrambled say, ""No food finer."
Ron Swanson,Clue three at J.J.'s Diner.
Ron Swanson,""" How many clues are there, exactly?"
Ron Swanson,"The point is, I ended up withdrawing all four requests to have you fired, because, ultimately, I'd rather work with a person of conviction than a wishywashy kissass."
Ron Swanson,That was the worst thing you were.
Ron Swanson,"No, you haven't."
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Take it easy.
Ron Swanson,"""Thank you, Old Gus, for brightening our lives, our hearts, and most importantly, our shoes."""
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,We're fine.
Ron Swanson,We're fine.
Ron Swanson,"You may have wandered into unknown terrain, but you're still you."
Ron Swanson,About me?
Ron Swanson,Right.
Ron Swanson,"I would say no to something you wanted to do, and you'd ignore me or go over my head and do it anyway."
Ron Swanson,"That's why you're my favorite, Tom."
Ron Swanson,Ha!
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Jeremy."
Ron Swanson,The thing I love about Tammy is she calls me on my crap.
Ron Swanson,"'Cause you're a kid, and kids always need money."
Ron Swanson,Am I right?
Ron Swanson,"You were insubordinate, stubborn, a pain in my ass, and, worst of all, bubbly."
Ron Swanson,You look like you could use 20 dollars.
Ron Swanson,That is a beautiful sweater vest.
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,Have Gun Will Travel reads the card of a man A knight without armor in a savage land.
Ron Swanson,Turns out the crotch blinder was inside you all along.
Ron Swanson,My exwife Tammy is back.
Ron Swanson,"The first year you worked here, you drove me nuts."
Ron Swanson,April.
Ron Swanson,"So, Marlene, it is true that you have won this award."
Ron Swanson,"I like pretty, dark haired women and breakfast food."
Ron Swanson,Yes?
Ron Swanson,"One day, Magnus, I will wear you as a jacket."
Ron Swanson,"Took a shot at the bastard, and he stuck his antlers through the door of my meat shed."
Ron Swanson,"The only celebrities I recognize are furniture maker Garry Knox Bennett, designer of the notorious and Magnus, the five-by-five bull elk I saw near my cabin two years ago."
Ron Swanson,"April, you take Leslie's office."
Ron Swanson,Understood?
Ron Swanson,I have no interest in consorting with celebrities.
Ron Swanson,just tell us the damn word.
Ron Swanson,Just make them feel like they've been heard.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, you can head home early."
Ron Swanson,I got it from context.
Ron Swanson,I knew that couldn't have been you.
Ron Swanson,You don't have the vocabulary.
Ron Swanson,That's why I refuse to write my signature in cursive.
Ron Swanson,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,"Right, now the four of us are gonna divvy up all these meetings."
Ron Swanson,"Today, I got the real thing."
Ron Swanson,"However, if they are not able to do it, which seems likely, as they're in their 90s, you and Leslie are choice number two."
Ron Swanson,Ralph Piatkowski and his wife Helen.
Ron Swanson,Perhaps I can be of service.
Ron Swanson,I tried to fire you four times.
Ron Swanson,"Andy, you're in the conference room."
Ron Swanson,I should have taken a picture of it.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ann."
Ron Swanson,Am I early?
Ron Swanson,"He's the Maitre D' at Mulligan's Steakhouse, and he knows me better than anyone."
Ron Swanson,A naked Tammy made me breakfast this morning.
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,I'm a pirate.
Ron Swanson,You're a doctor.
Ron Swanson,I meant your costume.
Ron Swanson,"If you need to boot again, the trash can's on your right."
Ron Swanson,"Also, here's Tom."
Ron Swanson,I like your costume.
Ron Swanson,It seems like her allergies are kicking in.
Ron Swanson,My name is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Ann, do you have any Mounds?"
Ron Swanson,We're cool.
Ron Swanson,I'm not an idiot.
Ron Swanson,I suppose you just need to figure out whether it's a path you truly wanna walk.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, no."
Ron Swanson,"On nights like this, when the cold winds blow, and the air is awash in the swirling eddies of our dreams, come with me and find safe haven in a warm bathtub full of my jazz."
Ron Swanson,A smooth and silky evening to you all.
Ron Swanson,But this stock photo I bought at a framing store isn't real.
Ron Swanson,"I refuse to lather Marlene up, kiss her ring like everybody else."
Ron Swanson,Marlene is a woman.
Ron Swanson,She has worked in the government for three decades.
Ron Swanson,Thirty years.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, it is."
Ron Swanson,"Properly applied, that's how long a good varnish should last."
Ron Swanson,"Now I will take your calls, apparently."
Ron Swanson,Instead I'll be delivering a speech of facts.
Ron Swanson,It will be enjoyable.
Ron Swanson,All proceeds will go toward building a park.
Ron Swanson,I am here to tell you about a black tie gala fundraiser for Pawnee Commons happening tonight.
Ron Swanson,Because all I can find are Almond Joys.
Ron Swanson,And almonds give me the squirts.
Ron Swanson,I prefer quality over flash.
Ron Swanson,Is a celebrity necessary?
Ron Swanson,"No, we're good."
Ron Swanson,Don't care.
Ron Swanson,Every guy needs that.
Ron Swanson,All hands on deck.
Ron Swanson,"So basically, we're completely swamped."
Ron Swanson,You're in politics.
Ron Swanson,What did you expect?
Ron Swanson,Ooh.
Ron Swanson,Are these the same kind of chips?
Ron Swanson,You can't even spell vocabulary.
Ron Swanson,There are a lot of Jeremy Jamms along the path you're walking.
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.
Ron Swanson,How much do you think Ann would miss this sconce?
Ron Swanson,Same.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need more Ron Swansons.
Ron Swanson,"Grapes of Wrath, chocolatechip ice cream, and Johnny Cash."
Ron Swanson,Next caller.
Ron Swanson,Come to the gala.
Ron Swanson,"Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat, and cats are pointless."
Ron Swanson,Next thing you want to do is ditch the Terrier and get yourself a proper dog.
Ron Swanson,That'll mask the scratches.
Ron Swanson,Don't trust big banks or small banks.
Ron Swanson,Take a walnut and rub it into the legs of your table.
Ron Swanson,Don't sass me.
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead, caller."
Ron Swanson,This is Ron.
Ron Swanson,Let's keep it down out there.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,So you talked to Tammy?
Ron Swanson,Great question.
Ron Swanson,What's it like to stare into the eye of Satan's butthole?
Ron Swanson,Banks are Ponzi schemes run by morons.
Ron Swanson,You're lonely.
Ron Swanson,I am not a sore loser.
Ron Swanson,"We'll split up, cover more ground."
Ron Swanson,Move.
Ron Swanson,"It's just that I prefer to win, and when I don't, I get furious."
Ron Swanson,Employee!
Ron Swanson,Good morning.
Ron Swanson,Your house isn't haunted.
Ron Swanson,Next caller.
Ron Swanson,My girlfriend's kids love it.
Ron Swanson,"I've seen three movies in my life Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton, and Herbie Fully Loaded."
Ron Swanson,That's as complicated as it should be to open a business in this country.
Ron Swanson,"""Yes, thank you."""
Ron Swanson,Would you like to buy them?
Ron Swanson,"Whatever happened to, ""Hey, I have some apples."""
Ron Swanson,It's pretty funny.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I guess there's nothing to do but spend the entire night methodically solving this puzzle."
Ron Swanson,"Listen, I was trying to buy this handcrafted mahogany wood model of a B25 Mitchell Panchito aircraft."
Ron Swanson,You slept with Brendanawicz?
Ron Swanson,"I'm Ron Swanson, and I am still taking your calls hopefully, about tonight's gala."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, again."
Ron Swanson,Ever.
Ron Swanson,Neither am I.
Ron Swanson,He now has that satisfied look that only comes with the pride of labor.
Ron Swanson,"This is the best day I've ever spent in a government building, and luckily my son was here to share it with me."
Ron Swanson,You're on the air.
Ron Swanson,Shouldn't you be taking her to lie down somewhere?
Ron Swanson,They were gonna put flecked linoleum over this beautifully preserved knotty red pine.
Ron Swanson,It's red pine.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, look, John."
Ron Swanson,You've aged horribly.
Ron Swanson,That didn't take long.
Ron Swanson,I did.
Ron Swanson,"Most people in this world, John, are ass[bleep]."
Ron Swanson,April!
Ron Swanson,What's wrong with you?
Ron Swanson,Wouldn't know never been hungover.
Ron Swanson,"Either way, well done, John."
Ron Swanson,"Look, Tammy and I don't work."
Ron Swanson,We are oil and water.
Ron Swanson,"Or oil, and TNT, and C4, and a detonator, and a butane torch."
Ron Swanson,Nothing good will come... Wait.
Ron Swanson,"She's here, isn't she?"
Ron Swanson,"She has a bad hangover, which she is pretending is allergies."
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,You live for this kind of stuff.
Ron Swanson,Let's get this over with.
Ron Swanson,"Please call now if you have questions about tonight's gala or one of my other interests Woodworking, uh, novels about tall ships, meat, that sort of thing."
Ron Swanson,It does.
Ron Swanson,"I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks, and go to sleep."
Ron Swanson,"After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, panfried in salted butter."
Ron Swanson,Or he pooped.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Only 22 clues left to go.
Ron Swanson,"""Follow me to the sheltered snow."
Ron Swanson,Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.
Ron Swanson,"Congratulations, Ben."
Ron Swanson,"I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings."
Ron Swanson,"People did them, and they are here now."
Ron Swanson,Some are small.
Ron Swanson,Some are big.
Ron Swanson,I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.
Ron Swanson,This room has several paintings in it.
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,Shut up and look at me!
Ron Swanson,Is that what you wanna hear?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, everyone."
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman."
Ron Swanson,All right!
Ron Swanson,"Welcome to ""Visions of Nature."""
Ron Swanson,We have 91 more meetings!
Ron Swanson,"Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further."
Ron Swanson,"You forgot to paint a painting, son."
Ron Swanson,Take this compass.
Ron Swanson,All great adventurers need one.
Ron Swanson,Round up whoever's free.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna do all of these today.
Ron Swanson,There she is.
Ron Swanson,Is this a hunting game?
Ron Swanson,End of speech.
Ron Swanson,"My question is, what the hell?"
Ron Swanson,I thought it was very big of you to not bend when Tammy promised you the vote.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Indeed, I do."
Ron Swanson,"If you'd like, I could offer you some pointers."
Ron Swanson,"Hunting, Donna, is about silence, balance, and patience."
Ron Swanson,This is truly a fine panda game you made.
Ron Swanson,Well done.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Where the hell are you going?
Ron Swanson,No way.
Ron Swanson,How do I get my quarters?
Ron Swanson,"""Check out this great offer."""
Ron Swanson,"I hate riddles and other such nonsense, I want that on the record."
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,I hate them both.
Ron Swanson,"On my deathbed, my final wish is to have my ex-wives rushed to my side, so I can use my dying breath to tell them both to go to hell one last time."
Ron Swanson,I want my money back.
Ron Swanson,Would I get married again?
Ron Swanson,"If you don't believe in love, what's the point of living?"
Ron Swanson,"But something wicked with a book is my exwife, from the library."
Ron Swanson,Which means I'm the one that succumbs.
Ron Swanson,"And I went to this website, and this ad popped up that said ""Hey, Ron Swanson!"""
Ron Swanson,""" Good God."
Ron Swanson,That woman is good.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, absolutely."
Ron Swanson,Would they not smell us?
Ron Swanson,"This gun is lightweight, there's no sight, and we are far too close to these deer."
Ron Swanson,I honestly believe that she was programmed by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness.
Ron Swanson,"Well, the game is absurd."
Ron Swanson,Who's next?
Ron Swanson,Thanks for coming in.
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,That bitch of an ex-wife is working for the library now.
Ron Swanson,That is perfect.
Ron Swanson,The worst person in the world working at the worst place in the world.
Ron Swanson,Great.
Ron Swanson,Will you?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,It's been a very rewarding day.
Ron Swanson,I also helped a child perform a tracheotomy on his elderly uncle.
Ron Swanson,I won't.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Not machines.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,"No, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, I was talking to these ribs."
Ron Swanson,"Ann, take your meetings in the courtyard."
Ron Swanson,"And there are not many people-- I mean, we were workplace proximity acquaintances for many years."
Ron Swanson,"And so, I thought I thought, maybeâ¦"
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,That woman is my nightmare.
Ron Swanson,"I'll take that steak to go, please and thank you."
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,I have a joke for you.
Ron Swanson,"Well, if you'd held them here instead of that conference room, I would have come to more meetings."
Ron Swanson,Establishing this national park right next to Pawnee is quite an accomplishment.
Ron Swanson,This is a fine piece of land you saved.
Ron Swanson,That horrifying Lifestyle Newsletter filled with vegan recipes and pointless tchotchkes?
Ron Swanson,"I... Well, first of all, I would be working for the federal government--"
Ron Swanson,Give me five minutes before the next one.
Ron Swanson,Keeping this crap off my desk.
Ron Swanson,"I've got to tell you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,But only because you were doing that one thing.
Ron Swanson,"But for the life of me, I cannot figure out what."
Ron Swanson,"My first day of college, my father dropped me off at the steel mill."
Ron Swanson,I am at something of a personal crossroads.
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, son."
Ron Swanson,"I once made the mistake of not talking to you at such a moment, and I do not intend to repeat that error."
Ron Swanson,I wish this office had only walls.
Ron Swanson,"I suppose I had simply accomplished everything I wanted to, and there seemed to be little point in continuing."
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's the problem."
Ron Swanson,The government in this town is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently.
Ron Swanson,"You know it's an uphill battle, but you love the struggle."
Ron Swanson,My kids are growing up.
Ron Swanson,"I would also add that you've already done a hell of a lot to make this town better, and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard work."
Ron Swanson,My days in an office feel like a waste.
Ron Swanson,I find it hilarious.
Ron Swanson,I disagree.
Ron Swanson,I would like to turn my attention to something that would make me feel useful.
Ron Swanson,I am not sure.
Ron Swanson,What do you want him to do?
Ron Swanson,"Well, there must be dozens of people gunning for this job."
Ron Swanson,Am I even qualified?
Ron Swanson,"Whatever's going on here, stop it immediately."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Time to go to work.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have to make a couple more adjustments."
Ron Swanson,"But I hitched a ride, enrolled, and learned a lot."
Ron Swanson,April was supposed to be the moat that kept the citizen barbarians away from Swanson Castle.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,How many more meetings?
Ron Swanson,Whole thing only took me about 20 minutes.
Ron Swanson,"Any moron with a crucible, an acetylene torch, and a cast-iron waffle maker could have done the same."
Ron Swanson,And just forged and shaped the rings.
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,Cooled it in antifreeze.
Ron Swanson,Clearing my throat.
Ron Swanson,People who buy things are suckers.
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't want you to ruffle any feathers.
Ron Swanson,To whom?
Ron Swanson,"Though hopefully not too fine, as I am not looking for any new friends."
Ron Swanson,He's quite a looker.
Ron Swanson,A handsome gentleman.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, I encourage it."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I can't thank you enough for sticking your nose where it didn't belong."
Ron Swanson,He didn't think I should go to college.
Ron Swanson,I don't care that you text all day and sleep at your desk.
Ron Swanson,End of speech.
Ron Swanson,When do I start?
Ron Swanson,I hired you to do one thing.
Ron Swanson,Instead she blew up the castle and stabbed me in the face.
Ron Swanson,Rangers.
Ron Swanson,My name is Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Your job, and mine, is to walk this land and make sure no one harms it."
Ron Swanson,"If you show up on time, speak honestly, and treat everyone with fairness, we will get along just fine."
Ron Swanson,Just one.
Ron Swanson,"You like fixing this town, Leslie, you always have."
Ron Swanson,Slainte.
Ron Swanson,Pleasure doing business with you.
Ron Swanson,We made love.
Ron Swanson,"You support them, win, lose, or draw."
Ron Swanson,That's what you do when you care about someone.
Ron Swanson,"Fine, a ballpark figure."
Ron Swanson,"Another word for ""jokes"" is ""lies."""
Ron Swanson,I do not lie.
Ron Swanson,Let's go back to the party.
Ron Swanson,"But seeing you pick on this pathetic, defenseless little man..."
Ron Swanson,That's enough.
Ron Swanson,I do not need some drawn-out legal expedition to tell me what I knew when I was eight.
Ron Swanson,Here's my original will.
Ron Swanson,"Do whatever lawyer nonsense you have to to make it official, and I will sign it."
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Ron Swanson,I was right not to be threatened by you.
Ron Swanson,"Therefore, I do not joke."
Ron Swanson,Reminded me what kind of a monster you are.
Ron Swanson,You drive.
Ron Swanson,"But to me, it was immensely satisfying because I enjoy fixing radiators."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I am returned."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,That's going to work?
Ron Swanson,"That'll do, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no, that's not necessary."
Ron Swanson,You know what I mean?
Ron Swanson,Again.
Ron Swanson,"It was so intense, I didn't know where my flesh stopped and hers began."
Ron Swanson,"Why are you working the permits desk, and why was that child clubbing your nuggets?"
Ron Swanson,I've had 11 whiskeys.
Ron Swanson,You almost had me.
Ron Swanson,Got a sec?
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,Just pay attention to the lecture and enjoy.
Ron Swanson,You really shouldn't have dug that out of the dumpster.
Ron Swanson,"You had a dream, and we wanted to support your dream."
Ron Swanson,We did it because we care about you.
Ron Swanson,What am I in for here?
Ron Swanson,Just give me whatever the Board thinks is fair.
Ron Swanson,"Don't get emotional, Vaughn."
Ron Swanson,You're embarrassing yourself.
Ron Swanson,Thank God!
Ron Swanson,They are a handsome bunch.
Ron Swanson,"Diane and I are especially proud, because Ivy was just accepted at Stanford University."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I will take it into consideration.
Ron Swanson,Then plant the damn ficuses yourself.
Ron Swanson,Thank you again.
Ron Swanson,"I sold some of my gold, and officially diversified my portfolio."
Ron Swanson,We didn't talk.
Ron Swanson,You'd have more success if he planted ficuses in your backyard.
Ron Swanson,I've seen your house.
Ron Swanson,I did.
Ron Swanson,Effective immediately.
Ron Swanson,I resign as chairman.
Ron Swanson,"That was it, right?"
Ron Swanson,Did you ever participate in meditation with Chris?
Ron Swanson,We didn't volunteer to help you because we wanted to wrap ourselves in personal glory.
Ron Swanson,"As long as I'm here, can I ask you a question?"
Ron Swanson,Weird.
Ron Swanson,Knope.
Ron Swanson,Make yourself useful and hand me that crescent wrench.
Ron Swanson,So did I.
Ron Swanson,It is perfect craftsmanship.
Ron Swanson,I calculate the cost of my labor at 38 dollars.
Ron Swanson,I can send the bill to you?
Ron Swanson,Here are some papers Leslie requested.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I imagine so."
Ron Swanson,"Not sure where I would go, really."
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,Damn it to hell!
Ron Swanson,Obviously keep it over a low flame to achieve a nice temper.
Ron Swanson,Pour it into a mold.
Ron Swanson,Liquefied the metal.
Ron Swanson,"I removed the sconce Fired up my grandfather's torch, heated up the pieces in a cast-iron bucket."
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure I'm interested in that.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, son, I am."
Ron Swanson,First joke ever.
Ron Swanson,Don't care for it.
Ron Swanson,Death does not scare me.
Ron Swanson,Get on with it.
Ron Swanson,"No, I am sure."
Ron Swanson,I can't hold this smile forever.
Ron Swanson,Megaphone.
Ron Swanson,Monday.
Ron Swanson,"The bigger ones will be tougher, like ""bring all of this crumbling to the ground."""
Ron Swanson,"Some are simple like ""take down traffic lights"" and ""eliminate the Post Office."""
Ron Swanson,"I mean, I have so many ideas."
Ron Swanson,What I am worried about is spoiling my children.
Ron Swanson,I look ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,"I don't want 'em to be the kind of people who never work, live off their trust funds, who buy their wooden furniture."
Ron Swanson,I am not interested in that.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, that should do it."
Ron Swanson,I'll handle this.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,I'm here for the interview about tonight's gala.
Ron Swanson,It's your wedding day.
Ron Swanson,Shut your damn mouth.
Ron Swanson,That has never been true.
Ron Swanson,The swing is fixed!
Ron Swanson,"Bully for you, Knope."
Ron Swanson,I had not considered that.
Ron Swanson,"My friend, I don't think you understand what a bad idea this is."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I think that maybe you are on to something."
Ron Swanson,I'm going to type every word I know!
Ron Swanson,Rectangle.
Ron Swanson,America.
Ron Swanson,Wow.
Ron Swanson,"I will leave my children $50 apiece for the cab home from my funeral and a steak dinner, end of discussion."
Ron Swanson,I'd never lose to a boar.
Ron Swanson,"If my secret got out, this office would be waist deep in women's undergarments."
Ron Swanson,Butthole.
Ron Swanson,I was not joking.
Ron Swanson,Here is your personnel file.
Ron Swanson,See for yourself.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Ron Swanson,"Benjamin, after thinking about what you said, I've decided to leave each of my children 5% of my fortune."
Ron Swanson,So what? I've tried to fire you.
Ron Swanson,Dismissed.
Ron Swanson,Keep reading.
Ron Swanson,Thank you all for being here.
Ron Swanson,But I do need to promote this event.
Ron Swanson,What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?
Ron Swanson,Let's get started.
Ron Swanson,"Also, if something should happen to Diane and me, we decided that the kids should go to the most important people in our lives."
Ron Swanson,Just sit there and don't ruin the city.
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry to hear that.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Ron Swanson,"Chris, I feel I should remind you that I do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist."
Ron Swanson,My musical career is private.
Ron Swanson,Absolutely not.
Ron Swanson,"So, please, keep it to yourself."
Ron Swanson,The only other people who know are Tom and April.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I am Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I have a twin brother.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,I am Duke Silver.
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Ron Swanson,You want a drink?
Ron Swanson,I will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it means I'm able to further limit reckless government spending.
Ron Swanson,Did you get that soda refill I asked for?
Ron Swanson,"That said, you'd be a fool not to pick me."
Ron Swanson,I'll give you that one.
Ron Swanson,The two of us.
Ron Swanson,But if you do it again
Ron Swanson,"Where the hell are you sending me, Knope?"
Ron Swanson,Alert the media.
Ron Swanson,Do whatever you want.
Ron Swanson,Enough of this.
Ron Swanson,"Corinthian leather, solid mahogany frame with what I believe are handcut mortise and tenon joints pinned with oak."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, what the [bleep]?"
Ron Swanson,I hope Andy does too.
Ron Swanson,Lagavulin all around? Don't bother answering.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I haven't relieved myself in five hours, so, if you'll excuse me."
Ron Swanson,That's a nice chair.
Ron Swanson,All set?
Ron Swanson,And you look very beautiful.
Ron Swanson,Your friendship means a lot to me.
Ron Swanson,You are a wonderful person.
Ron Swanson,"Before we go inside, I'd like to say something."
Ron Swanson,High and tight.
Ron Swanson,I've never willingly been here later than 5:04 p.m.
Ron Swanson,I am already pouring.
Ron Swanson,"Call FEMA, I don't care."
Ron Swanson,It's not rocket science.
Ron Swanson,How we doing?
Ron Swanson,"Hey, who wants to see me climb a tree?"
Ron Swanson,You don't know that.
Ron Swanson,But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.
Ron Swanson,Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying.
Ron Swanson,You don't have to drink yours.
Ron Swanson,May you restâ¦ in jazz.
Ron Swanson,I would rather never play again than have everyone know my secret.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,I have to kill Duke Silver.
Ron Swanson,I am ending my secret musical career.
Ron Swanson,Kindly get your groin off my desk.
Ron Swanson,Do not bother me with this again.
Ron Swanson,"Goodbye, Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.
Ron Swanson,"Plus, the whole thing is a scam."
Ron Swanson,"I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss, and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me."
Ron Swanson,"Nah, too much hassle."
Ron Swanson,I found this typewriter next to the courtyard dumpster.
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,"I know how much you enjoy paperwork, but don't hover."
Ron Swanson,Just go and get married.
Ron Swanson,"Well, please, don't worry about me."
Ron Swanson,"According to the complaint, you yelled it at five year old girls."
Ron Swanson,Morning.
Ron Swanson,An old Underwood 5 with original carriage return.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"Well, you're getting the better end of that deal."
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Ron Swanson,I took the quiz in your book about what kind of person I am.
Ron Swanson,I'm a Ron.
Ron Swanson,"I've never presented a bride on her wedding day, so I'm not 100% sure of the duties involved, but I don't think you're supposed to punch a man in the mouth during the service."
Ron Swanson,"Well done, you two."
Ron Swanson,Strong handshake.
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, women like scars."
Ron Swanson,"Shows you survived an attack, and they'll assume the attack was from a man."
Ron Swanson,I command you to do nothing.
Ron Swanson,To true love.
Ron Swanson,May we both find it.
Ron Swanson,"Not so fast, Shirley."
Ron Swanson,I was so careful.
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ron Swanson,Wedding present from Jerry.
Ron Swanson,"I just have to thaw the meat, season it, and grill it up."
Ron Swanson,So it's going to be a few hours.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, God."
Ron Swanson,I never Aha!
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Jack."
Ron Swanson,"Took her home, polished her up and bought a brand new ribbon off of electronicbay.com"
Ron Swanson,Just tell me what Leslie is planning.
Ron Swanson,"I like the kid, and I have the money."
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ron Swanson,"I don't want to seem overdramatic, but I don't really care what happens here."
Ron Swanson,"I'll take that bet at any odds, for any amount of money, over any length of time stretching from now into infinity."
Ron Swanson,Challenge accepted.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, Leslie, what do we do when we get this angry?"
Ron Swanson,Sit here.
Ron Swanson,Go do that in your office.
Ron Swanson,Sit here.
Ron Swanson,"There will be alcohol there, so I will go, as well."
Ron Swanson,And we'll wait for these guys to show up.
Ron Swanson,"Live your life how you want, but don't confuse drama with happiness."
Ron Swanson,"I choose ""sit here."""
Ron Swanson,"April, no--that stuff will melt the shell off a garden snail."
Ron Swanson,"You of all people should know that, Lauren."
Ron Swanson,"Second, there are only three ways to motivate people money, fear, and hunger."
Ron Swanson,The tracks do.
Ron Swanson,"First of all, you don't ""steer"" a locomotive."
Ron Swanson,"Or talk to anyone, or learn anyone's name."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Councilman."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, Leslie, snow cone lady."
Ron Swanson,I see you're about to play a round of publicly subsidized minigolf.
Ron Swanson,This ends now.
Ron Swanson,Enough.
Ron Swanson,I love you too.
Ron Swanson,"He's a nice man who's good with kids, and he seems to be smart and patient."
Ron Swanson,"JJ's has very good breakfast food, so it should remain open."
Ron Swanson,Please do not approach me on the street after this event and attempt to talk to me.
Ron Swanson,Our similarities begin and end with this single issue.
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"And you, you're going back to hell."
Ron Swanson,I don't see what the problem is.
Ron Swanson,I will give you a certain amount of gold in exchange for a recreational vehicle.
Ron Swanson,"Mom, you're going back to the farm."
Ron Swanson,This will be my new home.
Ron Swanson,The address is wherever it is parked.
Ron Swanson,Silence.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, darling."
Ron Swanson,I've been busy destroying most of my personal effects and threatening a postal worker.
Ron Swanson,Nectar of the gods.
Ron Swanson,What hounds?
Ron Swanson,"I honestly don't care, but I'm just gonna say it."
Ron Swanson,I'm on a mission to get off the grid.
Ron Swanson,Call off the dogs.
Ron Swanson,I like Joe.
Ron Swanson,I suppose you wouldn't consider moving.
Ron Swanson,I've heard the school system in the tunnels beneath Yucca Mountain is adequate.
Ron Swanson,Mind if I join you?
Ron Swanson,What I do like is breakfast food.
Ron Swanson,I tried not to notice anything when I worked here.
Ron Swanson,Did he?
Ron Swanson,"If we're going to lie to them, I will not let you lie to them."
Ron Swanson,We are not saying I was the problem.
Ron Swanson,Why can't the problem have been that I was reasonable and you were at fault?
Ron Swanson,Why do I have to be stubborn?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"And you'll be spending another $100 million, at least, to construct the building, roads, plumbing, electrical."
Ron Swanson,Call it off.
Ron Swanson,My company inspected all the buildings.
Ron Swanson,"They are disgusting, I grant you, but the guts are solid."
Ron Swanson,That sounds good.
Ron Swanson,It made it really annoying to stand in my doorway.
Ron Swanson,What about my office and its many walls?
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"I got a second box of donuts, if anybody-- What the [bleep] is this?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, you seemed like you wanted a friend."
Ron Swanson,You could.
Ron Swanson,But donating it will give you some good PR.
Ron Swanson,Which you desperately need.
Ron Swanson,It'll work.
Ron Swanson,Then you'll be secure in the knowledge that you gave it your best shot.
Ron Swanson,I loved that pillar.
Ron Swanson,Let's go with that.
Ron Swanson,And she's a bitch.
Ron Swanson,When is this over?
Ron Swanson,PR.
Ron Swanson,Which you could thenâ¦
Ron Swanson,They need you to get down there right away.
Ron Swanson,Tommy boy.
Ron Swanson,This is a great friend of mine.
Ron Swanson,He is a fellow who works in the building and he is named Dennis.
Ron Swanson,"Let me tell you something, Tom."
Ron Swanson,"He strongly enjoys japanese culture, and I thought he might wanna go with you to the thing."
Ron Swanson,You suck at Scrabble.
Ron Swanson,Someone is on fire in Ramsett Park.
Ron Swanson,"What the hell, Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,What if we have an emergency and have to get out of here?
Ron Swanson,I thought I was supposed to lay the ceremonial wreath.
Ron Swanson,"You're worse than my exwife, and she's terrible at Scrabble."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I will."
Ron Swanson,I'll keep it right here.
Ron Swanson,"It snaps right in, snug and secure."
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, good."
Ron Swanson,Why is Councilman Howser doing it?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,It's possible.
Ron Swanson,But I do really think they will go for it.
Ron Swanson,"And based on what I see from this vantage point, I do not like most of you."
Ron Swanson,And?
Ron Swanson,Let me know the second Donna returns.
Ron Swanson,He was my counterpart from the Eagleton Parks Department.
Ron Swanson,"Money, fear, hunger."
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ron Swanson,File!
Ron Swanson,You can eat when you have finished.
Ron Swanson,I need these blue folders done now.
Ron Swanson,This is the top priority.
Ron Swanson,Begin filing these blue ones.
Ron Swanson,I wanna help you take 'em down.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, stop filing those red folders at once."
Ron Swanson,How can I stop it?
Ron Swanson,"I don't know how this was delivered to me, but it cannot happen again."
Ron Swanson,"Ebony was due to a clerical error, but it ended up being an interesting year of reading."
Ron Swanson,"We only ever subscribe to two magazines, Reader's Digest and Ebony."
Ron Swanson,"Well, in my opinion, not enough people have looked their dinner in the eyes and considered the circle of life."
Ron Swanson,"I am not a spy, and I would never reveal classified information."
Ron Swanson,My family has had a single P.O. box for several generations.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Mother [bleep].
Ron Swanson,"Tell me what to do, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,No one is safe from these bastards.
Ron Swanson,So I destroyed the robot.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Mmm, mmm, mmm, me want more pointless social programs."
Ron Swanson,I think the wood model is best
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,What the hell is happening?
Ron Swanson,No comment.
Ron Swanson,Now I can get some real work done.
Ron Swanson,The world is a nightmare.
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,"Yummy, yummy, yum."
Ron Swanson,We need to talk.
Ron Swanson,This is a flying robot I just shot out of the sky after it delivered a package to my house.
Ron Swanson,The package was addressed to my son.
Ron Swanson,Who is four years old and does not own a Gryzzl doodad.
Ron Swanson,Somehow the robots looked at Diane's computer and learned something about my child and then brought him a box of presents.
Ron Swanson,But I know Gryzzl is dead set on owning the entire parcel.
Ron Swanson,I do not like rallies.
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure this plan will work.
Ron Swanson,This is an extreme invasion of privacy.
Ron Swanson,No need to discuss it with me.
Ron Swanson,Sounds private.
Ron Swanson,"And if I am, she tries to everything up."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,A fair point.
Ron Swanson,"But we did just have lunch last week, so I feel like we've spent enough social time together for the foreseeable Ever."
Ron Swanson,"Even though I'm a firm believer in the free market, and your failure as a businessman is ultimately to blame, it's still a travesty your diner is closing."
Ron Swanson,For some godforsaken reason that man is suddenly determined to hang on with me.
Ron Swanson,What is wrong with him?
Ron Swanson,My ex-wife Tammy likes to check in every so often and make sure I'm doing okay.
Ron Swanson,"You think I'd leave my gold in a locked safe buried underground, where anyone could find it? You don't know me at all."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Tammy."
Ron Swanson,I'm sure there are others.
Ron Swanson,I can't think of anything more noble to go to war over than bacon and eggs.
Ron Swanson,That's just one way it might be good.
Ron Swanson,"Instead, you'd contribute to society like a man."
Ron Swanson,"You would no longer be a government parasite, sucking the lifeblood from honest, hardworking people."
Ron Swanson,But you might consider the upside of losing your job.
Ron Swanson,"Chris, I'm not one for positive thinking or visualization or meditation or really anything in the world that you believe in."
Ron Swanson,That's decoy gold.
Ron Swanson,You're worrying over nothing.
Ron Swanson,Did you not hear me say there was no need to discuss it with me?
Ron Swanson,Maybe a drink will help.
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,"C'mon, Knope."
Ron Swanson,How about we go drown our sorrows in some waffles?
Ron Swanson,"Also, if I leave you alone, I'm pretty sure you'll die."
Ron Swanson,I'm always game for a brisk walk.
Ron Swanson,I'll join you.
Ron Swanson,How is that possible?
Ron Swanson,"This was sent to Ron Swanson at Diane's address, where I've lived for less than a month."
Ron Swanson,That really means a lot to me.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, friend."
Ron Swanson,"More wine, less talking."
Ron Swanson,They've been sent by the Governor.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, let's begin the barbecue."
Ron Swanson,Who or what is Penny Saver?
Ron Swanson,I have some great red birch with a nice spalting.
Ron Swanson,I already have some scale wainscoting.
Ron Swanson,They outrank everyone.
Ron Swanson,"I am submitting this menu from a Pawnee institution, JJ's diner, home of the world's best breakfast dish, The Four Horsemeals of the Eggporkcalypse."
Ron Swanson,There's no fight to be had here.
Ron Swanson,"We will take four bottles, please, and thank you."
Ron Swanson,I don't drink alcohol from that portion of the color spectrum.
Ron Swanson,Put some alcohol in your mouth to block the words from coming out.
Ron Swanson,The right to privacy is very important to me.
Ron Swanson,"That's that horrible kid who used to prank us all the time, right?"
Ron Swanson,"A wise woman once told me that whenever you and I team up, good things happen."
Ron Swanson,"Also, they called three hours ago, said they approved the plan, and asked me to begin drawings for the renovation."
Ron Swanson,Well said.
Ron Swanson,"""It doesn't."""
Ron Swanson,You must be Mrs. Burkiss.
Ron Swanson,Please leave me alone.
Ron Swanson,I am.
Ron Swanson,"I did, indeed."
Ron Swanson,Let's start with the facade.
Ron Swanson,Was the limestone locally hand-hewn?
Ron Swanson,Fascinating.
Ron Swanson,"What's ""cholesterol""?"
Ron Swanson,But tell me--
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Ron Swanson,I think you're being hard on yourself.
Ron Swanson,I'll be fine.
Ron Swanson,But don't worry about me.
Ron Swanson,I couldn't help but notice from afar that you are both acting like weirdoes.
Ron Swanson,I further suspect you have not yet talked about what happened.
Ron Swanson,I only meant to say that there's no shame in declaring how you feel to a person you cherish.
Ron Swanson,I am sorry if I caused a problem because the two of you make a good team.
Ron Swanson,"If you'll excuse me, I missed out on the food, and was denied a fascinating conversation about Michigan limestone."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I don't know, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,"No, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,"No, thank you."
Ron Swanson,"I live the way I live, I eat the things I eat, and I'll die the way I'll die."
Ron Swanson,I have never lied about anything in my life.
Ron Swanson,"Though, I suppose you could construe camouflage as a lie."
Ron Swanson,Tom wanted to convey that he likes you a great deal.
Ron Swanson,So he said that he could imagine marrying you and living on an island with your kids.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Now, do you know where I can find those little ham balls?"
Ron Swanson,Another stupid government rule.
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,"Then when you're 18, you can drink, gamble and become a libertarian."
Ron Swanson,Listen to your teachers and read all the books you can.
Ron Swanson,"All I'm saying is, keep an open mind for a while."
Ron Swanson,"It's also a place that costs the taxpayer 9,000 dollars in annual subsidies."
Ron Swanson,"I am not doing any of that, which is the point."
Ron Swanson,Continue with your awkward close quarters gyrating.
Ron Swanson,"Well, it seemed appropriate at the time."
Ron Swanson,I was only
Ron Swanson,I'm very sorry.
Ron Swanson,I'm a libertarian.
Ron Swanson,Forget this happened.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, children."
Ron Swanson,I legitimately believe that.
Ron Swanson,But I'll be damned if I don't properly honor the expression of romantic love.
Ron Swanson,"Well, no, I am not a liar."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, here's the situation."
Ron Swanson,"You're absolutely right, and I will bow out immediately."
Ron Swanson,"So, April wants to leave."
Ron Swanson,I always knew she would tire of government.
Ron Swanson,Took long enough.
Ron Swanson,We build things.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, let me show you around."
Ron Swanson,This is a door.
Ron Swanson,"These, of course, are walls."
Ron Swanson,What else?
Ron Swanson,What else?
Ron Swanson,"Very good question, April."
Ron Swanson,Ah.
Ron Swanson,"Don, this is Andrew and Benjamin."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, suppose the cat's out of the bag."
Ron Swanson,I have a brother.
Ron Swanson,One brother.
Ron Swanson,Tour is over.
Ron Swanson,Answer her.
Ron Swanson,Indeed.
Ron Swanson,"Meet our vice president, Don Swanson."
Ron Swanson,What kind of blade did he use?
Ron Swanson,This chair is almost caning itself.
Ron Swanson,Somebody just told me you were queen of the gays.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that is disappointing."
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry to see you go.
Ron Swanson,I've really come to think of you as a companion.
Ron Swanson,Canada.
Ron Swanson,Here's a hint no more departments.
Ron Swanson,Her name is Tammy Swanson and she's a serious bitch.
Ron Swanson,Have fun last night?
Ron Swanson,I found a way to reduce government spending by 85%.
Ron Swanson,Great news!
Ron Swanson,You are pandering to get a vote.
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,Talk.
Ron Swanson,Bully for you.
Ron Swanson,I just got a phone call.
Ron Swanson,They want you to go on Pawnee Today.
Ron Swanson,Chris!
Ron Swanson,"No, I don't suppose I would."
Ron Swanson,You.
Ron Swanson,That Marcia Langman from the family thing is calling for your resignation.
Ron Swanson,You gotta go on and defend yourself.
Ron Swanson,That's funny.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I doubt that."
Ron Swanson,I am a liar.
Ron Swanson,"Lucy, I have something to tell you."
Ron Swanson,So you'll write a new paper?
Ron Swanson,"Bully for you, son."
Ron Swanson,"More importantly, do you have tri-tip for tonight?"
Ron Swanson,"Because if not, I brought my own."
Ron Swanson,I love weddings.
Ron Swanson,"Good food, the celebration of romantic love, and most of all, churches."
Ron Swanson,"Say what you will about organized religion, those bastards knew how to construct an edifice."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,This went poorly.
Ron Swanson,I admit there was a time when that sort of behavior would've driven me wild.
Ron Swanson,Think.
Ron Swanson,What are you saying?
Ron Swanson,Which is why this is pointless.
Ron Swanson,April will not be participating in your pointless course because she has more important things to do like not participating in your pointless course.
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, Terry!"
Ron Swanson,I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.
Ron Swanson,But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing.
Ron Swanson,"Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing."
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,So enjoy yourself now.
Ron Swanson,"I just grab a few donuts, sit back, and enjoy the show."
Ron Swanson,"I've been head of the Parks department for 12 years, and I never had any ""management training"" course."
Ron Swanson,There must be a way out of here.
Ron Swanson,"She's buying you snow cones, and tomorrow you're voting on an issue that she cares about."
Ron Swanson,And you believe Lucy will be happy with this gift?
Ron Swanson,Who caught you guys?
Ron Swanson,She's had enough.
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Ron Swanson,I won't be playing.
Ron Swanson,I'm simply here to remind Councilman Jamm that this ridiculous play palace costs the taxpayers thousands of dollars a year.
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,Congratulations.
Ron Swanson,I do not approve of this.
Ron Swanson,"You and I both know that in my entire adult life, I have never checked a book out of the library."
Ron Swanson,"I think if you would know one thing about me, it would be that I prefer laying wreaths to lighting torches."
Ron Swanson,I would rather bleed out than sit here and talk about my feelings for 10 hours.
Ron Swanson,I have cried twice in my life.
Ron Swanson,"Once when I was seven, and I was hit by a school bus."
Ron Swanson,I'll simply punch my fist through a window.
Ron Swanson,I've always liked that Lucy.
Ron Swanson,Glad things are going well.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, there is."
Ron Swanson,And then again when I heard that Li'I Sebastian had passed.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"His memory will live on, as today we light a fire that will burn on for eternity."
Ron Swanson,You don't say.
Ron Swanson,"They always try to shake things up, and their ideas are terrible, and it brings City Hall to a grinding halt."
Ron Swanson,This is my favorite part about having a new city manager.
Ron Swanson,Excellent idea.
Ron Swanson,"But I am in a healthy relationship now, Tammy."
Ron Swanson,I have the police on standby.
Ron Swanson,This Allison Gliffert thing may have hit an eight.
Ron Swanson,"""Walk back"" sounds like lying."
Ron Swanson,A seven is when I lock you in your office until you cool down.
Ron Swanson,I try to steer you back to safety.
Ron Swanson,"Barbecues should be about one thing good, shared meat."
Ron Swanson,"Don't call me, ""Man."""
Ron Swanson,It's horrifying.
Ron Swanson,"If it reaches a six, like for example the incident with the girls' soccer uniforms back in '05â¦"
Ron Swanson,Every summer Leslie throws a barbecue to thank the Parks and Maintenance staff.
Ron Swanson,"I observe your behavior, and if it's a five or below, I say nothing."
Ron Swanson,"I have never told you this, but I actually have a ten-point scale for how insane you are being."
Ron Swanson,Is this what you want to do?
Ron Swanson,Look at me.
Ron Swanson,Terry.
Ron Swanson,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Ron Swanson,Have a seat.
Ron Swanson,"Then, I am going to snap you in half."
Ron Swanson,I am going to break out of here.
Ron Swanson,Stop.
Ron Swanson,Can you autograph this one for me?
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, son, the small hamburgers!"
Ron Swanson,And the prosecution rests.
Ron Swanson,It's your move.
Ron Swanson,"Think very carefully, son."
Ron Swanson,"One day, this year or maybe the next, you're gonna be somewhere else."
Ron Swanson,"Nice to have, but any foreman with half a brain doesn't need to look at them."
Ron Swanson,"Control yourselves, Gergiches!"
Ron Swanson,They're like blueprints for a house.
Ron Swanson,I normally don't get involved in people's personal affairs but something about a wedding... I'll just say it.
Ron Swanson,Tom is quite taken with you.
Ron Swanson,Yes!
Ron Swanson,"He said he'd ""marry you tomorrow."""
Ron Swanson,Blueprints for the future are a fool's errand.
Ron Swanson,"A lovely, intelligent, self-possessed pediatric surgeon named Wendy."
Ron Swanson,Clear the late charges and cut the crap.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Ron Swanson,"And most of all, there will be no [Bleep] vegetables."
Ron Swanson,There will be no adult men in costumes.
Ron Swanson,There will be no giant soap bubble guns.
Ron Swanson,"Absolutely, my dear."
Ron Swanson,"I am off to have a mid-morning pre-lunch with my lady friend, but I will be back in time for lunch."
Ron Swanson,"Ladies, ladies."
Ron Swanson,There will be no froofy desserts.
Ron Swanson,Prepare to experience true freedom and bliss.
Ron Swanson,"We did things your way, now we're gonna do it my way."
Ron Swanson,"Why, Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for sharing, Jenny."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, do you maybe see a problem with what you've done?"
Ron Swanson,"Donna, you know as well as I do these city manager shakeups always peter out."
Ron Swanson,The important thing is the dam is never happening and your dream has been crushed.
Ron Swanson,I am not.
Ron Swanson,Good meeting.
Ron Swanson,Places are for being.
Ron Swanson,Because of your interview.
Ron Swanson,End of discussion.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,You blathered on for 10 minutes about social safety nets and honest governance and improving lives.
Ron Swanson,Basic nonsense.
Ron Swanson,Wherever it's headed now.
Ron Swanson,Mmhmm.
Ron Swanson,We can decorate our offices as they are in real life.
Ron Swanson,"No, that was not it."
Ron Swanson,"After I said you were full of it, you got very angry and scrunched up your face and said, ""Excuse me, sir, but I disagree."""
Ron Swanson,Did you let me have it.
Ron Swanson,"That was one of your top 10 tirades, I'd say."
Ron Swanson,I am Donna's work proximity associate.
Ron Swanson,My name is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Joe."
Ron Swanson,You were pounding your fist and shaking.
Ron Swanson,"If you help me get off the grid, I will let both of you go home early."
Ron Swanson,Food is for eating.
Ron Swanson,I'll talk to a man with a ponytail.
Ron Swanson,I'll watch a foreign film.
Ron Swanson,What was that tone?
Ron Swanson,"""Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky."""
Ron Swanson,"So far, so accurate."
Ron Swanson,"""If we were to work together, she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other."""
Ron Swanson,"No, I didn't."
Ron Swanson,I remember that part.
Ron Swanson,"It says, ""Hire her."""
Ron Swanson,Did you hear that?
Ron Swanson,Also we're cancelling all of your ongoing projects.
Ron Swanson,Hello!
Ron Swanson,People ought to have the right to be left alone.
Ron Swanson,Hello!
Ron Swanson,I wanna get completely off the grid.
Ron Swanson,Janitor!
Ron Swanson,Tread lightly.
Ron Swanson,"I'm onto you, friend."
Ron Swanson,Dam's dead.
Ron Swanson,Hey!
Ron Swanson,"Please, Mr. Janitor."
Ron Swanson,"If you just look over here for two seconds, I'll do anything."
Ron Swanson,Have a nice day.
Ron Swanson,You called me a heartless thug.
Ron Swanson,Can I hear it?
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Ron Swanson,I would rather work with a person like that than with a milquetoast yes-man.
Ron Swanson,I need to ask you for a favor.
Ron Swanson,Another bureaucrat ate it.
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Craig is studying yoga."
Ron Swanson,These are the only dry clothes I could find.
Ron Swanson,"When I walked in this morning and saw the flag was at halfmast, I thought, ""All right."""
Ron Swanson,I feel extremely angry.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,I'm re-gifting.
Ron Swanson,"It's against, like, three laws and a dozen health codes."
Ron Swanson,But then I found out it was Li'I Sebastian.
Ron Swanson,I doubt it.
Ron Swanson,She's also not brief.
Ron Swanson,This is gonna take forever.
Ron Swanson,"It's just us, I hope."
Ron Swanson,You left.
Ron Swanson,"Then a month later, you took Terry with you."
Ron Swanson,We may destroy this government one day after all.
Ron Swanson,"Keep it up, Filo."
Ron Swanson,That is one compelling argument.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, son."
Ron Swanson,"If there's one thing Leslie's not, it's sloppy."
Ron Swanson,Halfmast is too high.
Ron Swanson,I see.
Ron Swanson,Show some damned respect.
Ron Swanson,Should be one more thing in that file.
Ron Swanson,"No, pig Tom."
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Tom."
Ron Swanson,Barbecue is postponed until I can go pick up some meat from the Food 'n' Stuff.
Ron Swanson,Liar.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,I understand this problem well and agree to this exchange of services.
Ron Swanson,Tammy two once seduced a coroner and had me declared legally dead just so she could get a discount on a plane ticket.
Ron Swanson,That was the real reason I hired you.
Ron Swanson,Those brownies were damn good.
Ron Swanson,Also the budget is 600 dollars.
Ron Swanson,"Amen, we need to send that glorious beast into the great beyond with a display that rivals the Super Bowl Halftime Show."
Ron Swanson,"Donna, my two ex-wives are the worst people in the world."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, don't push it."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I will be providing several slabs of my world famous Swanson ribs."
Ron Swanson,Your Tammy?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, playtime is over."
Ron Swanson,I'm getting out of here once and for all.
Ron Swanson,"They require volunteers, so I want you to come with me to my daughters' public elementary school to help make costumes."
Ron Swanson,Part of the unity concert is a youth revue about the history of Pawnee.
Ron Swanson,"Keep your voice down, woman!"
Ron Swanson,"You were tough and honest, and you stood up for what you believed in, even though it might've killed your chance to get the job."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, for God's sake."
Ron Swanson,I forgot what I wrote.
Ron Swanson,Why would anyone need more than three lines?
Ron Swanson,"Girls, Ron's got sharp tools now."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,How many more questions are you going to ask me?
Ron Swanson,I will build a small wood model of the parks department.
Ron Swanson,I have an idea.
Ron Swanson,I know I saw it.
Ron Swanson,Ah-hah!
Ron Swanson,Detonator.
Ron Swanson,I asked Jerry to come in.
Ron Swanson,The partially defused Claymore mine you gave me 10 years ago.
Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"I'm being held as a prisoner against my will, and I have the right, as a citizen of the United States, to blow a hole in that [bleep] door and walk out as a free man."
Ron Swanson,It's in the Constitution.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?
Ron Swanson,Too late.
Ron Swanson,Here we go.
Ron Swanson,Fire in the hole!
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna use it to blow a hole in this damn door so I can get out of here.
Ron Swanson,"That new intern wasn't working out, so I got rid of him."
Ron Swanson,"If you don't like it, go to that new place, Complete Food."
Ron Swanson,"Once again, noted."
Ron Swanson,That is not the whole story of why I left.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, your time is up."
Ron Swanson,"Plus, Ben buttdialed me last night."
Ron Swanson,I'd like to think I know you pretty well.
Ron Swanson,We've worked together for a while now.
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,See you tomorrow morning.
Ron Swanson,The Bulge.
Ron Swanson,It's behind my house.
Ron Swanson,Hydrax cookies? Did you know there was a off-brand Hydrox? I did not. They're not bad.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Go away.
Ron Swanson,"For a libertarian such as myself, it's philosophically horrifying. They also really cheap out on snacks."
Ron Swanson,That was you?
Ron Swanson,"If you'll excuse me, Joe, I have to finish hogging out the cheeks on these lap joints."
Ron Swanson,The name of the store is Food and Stuff.
Ron Swanson,"I do, indeed."
Ron Swanson,"Are you hearing me, son? Jerry will come in once a week, and everyone will get to watch him eat and talk to him about anything he might do or say or fart."
Ron Swanson,That was well played.
Ron Swanson,"They sell food, and they sell stuff."
Ron Swanson,I have also asked Jerry to come in a couple hours a week until we find a permanent replacement.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"I'm describing a person, not something complicated like a wooden sailing ship or proper dovetail technique."
Ron Swanson,"Once a year, every branch of this government meets in a room and announces what they intend to waste taxpayer money on."
Ron Swanson,Yay.
Ron Swanson,He does have a business where he rents out his clothes to 12 year olds.
Ron Swanson,"Well, half grown."
Ron Swanson,He's a grown man.
Ron Swanson,Tom can take care of himself.
Ron Swanson,The Hoover Dam is a travesty.
Ron Swanson,I'm very busy here.
Ron Swanson,"What did you do now, Joe?"
Ron Swanson,Uh-oh.
Ron Swanson,And I won't be able to stop him.
Ron Swanson,"I also believe in cutting useful projects, future projects, and past projects."
Ron Swanson,Do you expect me to make a chair out of transistor chips and small wires?
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you'll argue against it with your trademark vigor.
Ron Swanson,Why would you think that?
Ron Swanson,She hasn't lived there for five years.
Ron Swanson,Stand up for yourself.
Ron Swanson,You don't want to be a whipping boy.
Ron Swanson,"Well, is whining going to do anything about it?"
Ron Swanson,How?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Present.
Ron Swanson,"Look, the defunding of the minigolf course is on the agenda for the city council meeting tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,I believe in cutting useless government projects.
Ron Swanson,"If you get caught, which you clearly will, Chris will fire you."
Ron Swanson,I can make room in my schedule.
Ron Swanson,You mean to tell me I have had a toy on my desk for 10 years?
Ron Swanson,Nice.
Ron Swanson,That's not the whole story.
Ron Swanson,She definitely loves Ann.
Ron Swanson,Jack London.
Ron Swanson,"""Ben"" And much larger, ""Ann."""
Ron Swanson,Make him proud.
Ron Swanson,What's all this?
Ron Swanson,I've personally put out several local fires at no cost to the taxpayer.
Ron Swanson,"Good God, woman."
Ron Swanson,Have you considered cutting the entire fire department?
Ron Swanson,"Chris, it would be my absolute pleasure."
Ron Swanson,I'm guessing it's my latest budget cut proposal based on your rage sweat.
Ron Swanson,Is that nuclear waste?
Ron Swanson,Unfortunately not.
Ron Swanson,The park you built is nice and people want to live next to it.
Ron Swanson,How did you get that?
Ron Swanson,The world needs apartment buildings.
Ron Swanson,"This is the memorial for Li'I Sebastian, not double coupon night at a strip club."
Ron Swanson,Jean-Ralphio is a clown.
Ron Swanson,This is a scandal waiting to happen.
Ron Swanson,You told me this was a genuine partially defused Claymore mine.
Ron Swanson,It will be Cute.
Ron Swanson,Why on earth would I get an intern?
Ron Swanson,"Usually, I only read nautical novels and my own personal manifestos, but I'm proud to make this exception."
Ron Swanson,"Tom only performs when there's someone to impress, so marooning him on Freak Island isn't helping anyone."
Ron Swanson,They're miserable.
Ron Swanson,"No, they won't."
Ron Swanson,My department has to go back to the way it was.
Ron Swanson,"So, it pains me to say this."
Ron Swanson,I mean that as a compliment.
Ron Swanson,You have come up with a plan so spectacularly horrible that it might ruin the entire department.
Ron Swanson,Chris.
Ron Swanson,It's so It's so beautiful.
Ron Swanson,And you made April assistant to everyone? You know who April hates? Everyone.
Ron Swanson,She had it installed over the weekend.
Ron Swanson,It makes me furious.
Ron Swanson,"As you requested, here is a picture of my son, at a recent moment in his life."
Ron Swanson,"And every year, she gets me something thoughtful and personal."
Ron Swanson,Protecting my son's privacy.
Ron Swanson,"What, I'm just gonna carry around pictures of my child, where anyone could see them?"
Ron Swanson,"Every year, I give Leslie the same present I give everyone: A crisp $20 bill."
Ron Swanson,I have no reaction to this.
Ron Swanson,"I do not pass judgment on the workings of private businesses, I just build their buildings."
Ron Swanson,"And frankly, if people are foolish enough to carry around a doodad that lets Gryzzl track their every move, this is what they get."
Ron Swanson,"This year, she outdid herself."
Ron Swanson,And Jerry can only function if no one's looking.
Ron Swanson,"You shine a light on him, and he shrinks up faster than an Eskimo's scrotum."
Ron Swanson,No need to worry.
Ron Swanson,How to build a cribbage board.
Ron Swanson,How to start a fire without matches.
Ron Swanson,"Everything running smoothly? You know, I'm happy to go back out there, demonstrate more of my skills."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Marcia Langman from the Society For Family Stability Foundation."
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, Knope."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have nothing to do with this, so."
Ron Swanson,I may have a compromise.
Ron Swanson,Just calm down.
Ron Swanson,"You won't ever hear me say this again, so savor this moment."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,You don't even know what they're going to do.
Ron Swanson,That's too much information.
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Ron Swanson,I've eaten a lot of food in a lot of restaurants.
Ron Swanson,Why is everyone else so bad at eating?
Ron Swanson,"Ah, nature."
Ron Swanson,"Soon, one of you will be ridiculed mercilessly."
Ron Swanson,The strong prey on the weak.
Ron Swanson,It's Social Darwinism.
Ron Swanson,"When one Jerry leaves, the office naturally selects a new Jerry to fill that role."
Ron Swanson,"Every place I've ever worked in has had a ""Jerry."""
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.
Ron Swanson,Get some sleep.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, thank you for your service."
Ron Swanson,I don't believe that's true.
Ron Swanson,"It directs you to this appendix, which reroutes you to this one, which says, in a subfootnote"
Ron Swanson,Pediatrician files confiscated and destroyed.
Ron Swanson,Anything I'm missing?
Ron Swanson,"It's like a big, fat, angry slob spending money it doesn't have on crap it doesn't need."
Ron Swanson,"Sure, what can I do you for?"
Ron Swanson,Is Star Wars the one with the little wizard boy?
Ron Swanson,I will speak with you for three minutes.
Ron Swanson,What the hell are you talking about?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, do I?"
Ron Swanson,"Amendment C, addendum 14."
Ron Swanson,Ben's right.
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna sign a legally binding document, you need to read it thoroughly."
Ron Swanson,I agree.
Ron Swanson,That's why the only contract I've ever signed was my Mulligan's Steakhouse Club Card.
Ron Swanson,"And even then, I used a fake name."
Ron Swanson,Les.
Ron Swanson,Les Vegetables.
Ron Swanson,Mission accomplished.
Ron Swanson,And I predicted that I would learn nothing from this process.
Ron Swanson,You just have to wait.
Ron Swanson,This is Ice Town all over again.
Ron Swanson,Look closer.
Ron Swanson,Check out the page I marked.
Ron Swanson,This is the 27th version of the Pawnee Gryzzl free wireless Internet thing agreement.
Ron Swanson,"I've spent a fair amount of time with Gryzzl's highpriced lawyers, and they do seem to, as they say, ""Keep it 100."""
Ron Swanson,"I am the director of the Parks Department, and this is a park."
Ron Swanson,I have a permit.
Ron Swanson,Not to worry.
Ron Swanson,We were work proximity associates.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I'd be fine with that. This government is diseased."
Ron Swanson,You can blow it up for a fun play ball.
Ron Swanson,"If you do a good job, I'll give you the bladder."
Ron Swanson,Which one of you youngsters wants to help me drain the blood from this animal?
Ron Swanson,Good point.
Ron Swanson,"A dog we're going to cook, chew, and swallow."
Ron Swanson,He's basically a dog.
Ron Swanson,Tom is very smart and incredibly loyal.
Ron Swanson,"I understand that it's hilarious, but that is his given, Christian name."
Ron Swanson,"So, what would you like to talk about?"
Ron Swanson,Seriously?
Ron Swanson,His name is Tom.
Ron Swanson,This is your dinner.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, all public photos of me recovered."
Ron Swanson,Nameplate removed from my office door.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, do not go on television."
Ron Swanson,You're right.
Ron Swanson,Why does anybody in the world ever eat anything but breakfast food?
Ron Swanson,Did he drug me?
Ron Swanson,We need to get Leslie something that erases the enormous emotional debt that has built up over years of this gift giving imbalance.
Ron Swanson,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a lady, two little girls, and an infant waiting for me."
Ron Swanson,Get out.
Ron Swanson,Sorry we couldn't help you work through your problems.
Ron Swanson,Nothing important.
Ron Swanson,Just thought you might want to have lunch.
Ron Swanson,Tomorrow?
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"I'll be taking the bus now, and I'll be paying in cash."
Ron Swanson,Excellent.
Ron Swanson,As luck would have it--
Ron Swanson,See you then.
Ron Swanson,"Think, people."
Ron Swanson,I remember.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Tom!"
Ron Swanson,Quite sure.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I do feel a little guilty."
Ron Swanson,"I will hold onto this for you until we get you licensed up, and then I'll take you for some target practice."
Ron Swanson,"You did, yes."
Ron Swanson,I'll also get out here and walk home.
Ron Swanson,"I waited for a while, but it was pretty easy to figure out what had happened."
Ron Swanson,What other traces of me exist in the world?
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Larry.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, April."
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Haverford, maybe one day you'll figure out how to spell a three letter word."
Ron Swanson,A new person in the office?
Ron Swanson,You made me wear a leather jacket.
Ron Swanson,Filo Pilo.
Ron Swanson,Anyone find any mistakes?
Ron Swanson,"Paul, if you ever see another one of these with my name on it, I want you to drive into the woods and bury it."
Ron Swanson,Amen.
Ron Swanson,Then you took April.
Ron Swanson,"I didn't want her to go, as she had become one of my closest workplace acquaintances."
Ron Swanson,But your offer was too good to pass up.
Ron Swanson,So I didn't try to stop her.
Ron Swanson,Then Tom left to run his business.
Ron Swanson,Donna left to run hers.
Ron Swanson,"One day, I looked up."
Ron Swanson,Just didn't recognize anyone.
Ron Swanson,So I made a decision.
Ron Swanson,An unthinkable decision.
Ron Swanson,Really puts things in perspective.
Ron Swanson,It's always nice to see the kids at the end of a long day.
Ron Swanson,Passing the buck the last refuge of the cowardly and blackhearted.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Your life seemed pretty hectic.
Ron Swanson,This is him right here.
Ron Swanson,"This two toned, lightweight model is perfect for a skinny, little thing like you."
Ron Swanson,"That there is a Sig Sauer .22 caliber Mosquito, manufactured in Switzerland for their pussy police force."
Ron Swanson,I hate projects.
Ron Swanson,"We just spent 12 hours together, woman."
Ron Swanson,I have a small object for you.
Ron Swanson,"Call it an official peace offering, I suppose."
Ron Swanson,"What the [bleep] are you doing, Perd Hapley?"
Ron Swanson,The frame is the gift.
Ron Swanson,"When my company took on the Morningstar development, and I realized it meant bulldozing Ann's old house, I salvaged her front door."
Ron Swanson,Then I stripped off all the terrible paint and lacquer-- People really don't know how to finish wood properly.
Ron Swanson,And I made it into this frame for you in the event that you and I everâ¦
Ron Swanson,That seems unnecessary.
Ron Swanson,I don't know what happened.
Ron Swanson,I declined his invitation.
Ron Swanson,Let Tom know we haven't found anything.
Ron Swanson,He started laughing.
Ron Swanson,"And the next thing I knew, we were at lunch."
Ron Swanson,How about you buy me a meal? You hungry?
Ron Swanson,"JJ, a few months ago, I came in here and began eating eggs."
Ron Swanson,"They were delicious, so I ordered more."
Ron Swanson,"Before long, I believe I had eaten"
Ron Swanson,Everyone start thinking of ideas.
Ron Swanson,I believe Leslie said to organize these by year.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,Stop this!
Ron Swanson,I don't have any projects.
Ron Swanson,Work proximity associateships.
Ron Swanson,It is money.
Ron Swanson,Do not burn that check.
Ron Swanson,I was gonna ask you for a job.
Ron Swanson,In the federal government.
Ron Swanson,Because it doesn't exist because that's nonsense because you're an adult.
Ron Swanson,Just saying it out loud feels dirty.
Ron Swanson,A week.
Ron Swanson,She should know how to responsibly handle and discharge a weapon.
Ron Swanson,She's an adult now.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you know how new city managers are."
Ron Swanson,"Honestly, Leslie, it's fine."
Ron Swanson,It was a punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written.
Ron Swanson,My time in government work was over.
Ron Swanson,"Sure, I loved shutting things down and bleeding the rotting beast from the inside."
Ron Swanson,Open mine.
Ron Swanson,"But it was time for me to leave, and I didn't feel like explaining why to you or anyone."
Ron Swanson,"Everything that happened after, the fight we had, not giving you a heads-up when my company took on the Morningstar development and bulldozed the nurse's old house, I do regret that."
Ron Swanson,I had a good run here.
Ron Swanson,"But after you and Tom and Donna and April and Terry left, when I looked around this office, nothing was the same."
Ron Swanson,You'll have to be more specific.
Ron Swanson,Ah.
Ron Swanson,That won't be necessary.
Ron Swanson,Ann was getting a little chummy.
Ron Swanson,Beat that.
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's nice."
Ron Swanson,I guess.
Ron Swanson,"But it turns out, much to my surprise, there is actually one place in Europe that is worth seeing: these tiny islands off the coast of Scotland, where God's chosen elixirs are distilled, barreled, and prepared for consumption."
Ron Swanson,Choose wisely.
Ron Swanson,You stupid.
Ron Swanson,Big swing and a miss.
Ron Swanson,"That you love her and you understand that it's her life, and geography will never change your feelings."
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,All my life I've avoided Europe and its multitudes of terribleness.
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, you need to get your tooth fixed."
Ron Swanson,Where do I start?
Ron Swanson,These will not be necessary.
Ron Swanson,"You can't force friendship, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"All right, party time."
Ron Swanson,It takes time.
Ron Swanson,Just let business be business and government be government.
Ron Swanson,"When a business fails, it dies, and a new, better one takes its place."
Ron Swanson,It's beautiful and brutal and should be left alone.
Ron Swanson,The free market is a jungle.
Ron Swanson,There is not.
Ron Swanson,"And it should never be defined by the terms ""liberal"" or ""conservative."""
Ron Swanson,"One, get rid of Tammy, or two, lobotomy and castration."
Ron Swanson,So you have two choices.
Ron Swanson,"If you don't take care of the problem now, it's only gonna get worse."
Ron Swanson,The one at the very end.
Ron Swanson,Son of a bitch.
Ron Swanson,"Stop, please."
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Ron Swanson,"I was never here, and you will never speak of this again"
Ron Swanson,A man after my own heart.
Ron Swanson,It's Ron.
Ron Swanson,"If you're watching this, it means that once again you have danced with the devil."
Ron Swanson,"Right now, you're probably thinking, ""Tammy's changed."""
Ron Swanson,"""We'll be happy together."""
Ron Swanson,I don't know what she thought I'd get out of that.
Ron Swanson,"""Oh, were my love yon lilac fair, with purple blossoms to the spring, and I, a bird to shelter there, when wearied on my little wing, how I would mourn when it was torn by autumn wild and winter rude, but I would sing on wanton wing, when youthful may its bloom renewed."""
Ron Swanson,"""Love, Leslie."""
Ron Swanson,"""As you sit here and gaze upon the waters, please read out loud the poem by the great Scotsman Robert Burns."""
Ron Swanson,"""Dear Ron, you have now reached the cliffsides overlooking the islands."""
Ron Swanson,This is worth the trip.
Ron Swanson,I'll drive you back.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, enough is enough."
Ron Swanson,But you're only thinking that because she's a monstrous parasite who entered through your privates and lodged herself in your brain.
Ron Swanson,"What is wrong with you, woman?"
Ron Swanson,Come on.
Ron Swanson,I once thought I had a friend.
Ron Swanson,"No, Lane 22."
Ron Swanson,Settle down.
Ron Swanson,Then it turned out he was the single worst person I have ever met.
Ron Swanson,Thank you for everything you've done for the children of this area.
Ron Swanson,You are mistaken.
Ron Swanson,Remove the graphic.
Ron Swanson,Tom?
Ron Swanson,"No, no you didn't."
Ron Swanson,"I'm not mad, I just want to know"
Ron Swanson,"So, who broke it?"
Ron Swanson,Hire Very Good Building Company for your construction needs.
Ron Swanson,Or do not.
Ron Swanson,"I sure have had some fun making things with you, son."
Ron Swanson,I am not a beggar.
Ron Swanson,This is a waste of time.
Ron Swanson,"and I said that you'll get a lot of job offers in your life, but you only have one hometown."
Ron Swanson,"I believe I said that I thought we worked well together, and that I might disagree with your philosophy but I respected you."
Ron Swanson,You people have no idea what you're talking about.
Ron Swanson,"Do whatever the hell you want, what do I care?"
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,She did indeed.
Ron Swanson,Its only legal use is to strip varnish off of speedboats.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, it was."
Ron Swanson,End of commercial.
Ron Swanson,"That is incorrect, in a number of ways."
Ron Swanson,You cannot eat it.
Ron Swanson,The wood does not taste like cherry.
Ron Swanson,And England okay and France terrible.
Ron Swanson,It's what makes America great.
Ron Swanson,It moves our country forward.
Ron Swanson,"Capitalism is the only way, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"I know what I'm about, son."
Ron Swanson,And I'll have the number eight.
Ron Swanson,Libertarianism is all about individual liberty.
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,No can do.
Ron Swanson,It was getting a little chummy around here.
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,I predict ten minutes from now they'll be at each other's throats with war paint on their faces and a pig head on a stick.
Ron Swanson,It burned my hand so I punched it.
Ron Swanson,I broke it.
Ron Swanson,"No, who broke it?"
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, remove this man before I commit an act of violence against him."
Ron Swanson,My contract is very specific.
Ron Swanson,I do not have to answer that question.
Ron Swanson,"This week, I am making a shadowbox frame, which can be used to display an object of great value."
Ron Swanson,This one is constructed with American cherry wood.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I don't think so.
Ron Swanson,"I just came down to see the effects of your government intervention, and I've got to hand it to you You really turned this place around."
Ron Swanson,"I don't like to give out my address to anyone, much less have it on an official record."
Ron Swanson,Beep!
Ron Swanson,I didn't shave it off.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, no, don't drink that."
Ron Swanson,"Ah, councilwoman."
Ron Swanson,"In honor of your neverending quest to personally babysit each and every American citizen, I went to Paunch Burger and got myself a Number two Double Bacon Grenade Deluxe, hash browns, chili cheese fries, and one poached egg."
Ron Swanson,It rubbed off.
Ron Swanson,Knope!
Ron Swanson,My office!
Ron Swanson,Now!
Ron Swanson,From friction.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Ron Swanson,I also picked up a 64ounce Sweetums Sugar Splash.
Ron Swanson,Are you high?
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, I love this country so much."
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,"You never did ask me for permission, did you?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, I'm sorry to burst your ka- bubble, but I just had my ass ka- handed to me by the City Manager."
Ron Swanson,And now this entire department is ka- screwed.
Ron Swanson,Please don't.
Ron Swanson,What the K- [bleep] were you thinking?
Ron Swanson,I would prefer that she ask me for my permission so I can say no.
Ron Swanson,You don't smoke.
Ron Swanson,This is our song.
Ron Swanson,I didn't think it was relevant.
Ron Swanson,Can you turn the radio off?
Ron Swanson,What in the name of all that is holy is that smell?
Ron Swanson,You need six pins to win.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, come on."
Ron Swanson,Shut your damn mouth.
Ron Swanson,"If I don't get a solid five, it kills my sunny disposition."
Ron Swanson,I have to nap up.
Ron Swanson,That's horrible.
Ron Swanson,Well... Here you go.
Ron Swanson,Which is water that's lying about being milk.
Ron Swanson,Skim milk.
Ron Swanson,There's only one thing I hate more than lying.
Ron Swanson,"Unfortunately, every single word out of their mouths was a lie."
Ron Swanson,Tom and April were excellent witnesses in my defense.
Ron Swanson,There most certainly is.
Ron Swanson,What is happening?
Ron Swanson,What do I have to do?
Ron Swanson,I'm here.
Ron Swanson,I got it!
Ron Swanson,It's been kind of a crazy night.
Ron Swanson,We use it to burn warts off of the mules!
Ron Swanson,Take me back to Tammy.
Ron Swanson,I like saying no.
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Ron Swanson,It lowers their enthusiasm.
Ron Swanson,That woman is tough.
Ron Swanson,What flavor ice cream would you and the children like?
Ron Swanson,I'm always on duty.
Ron Swanson,"13,000 for orthodontic surgery, 6,000 for enamel repair, and 46 million for psychological damages."
Ron Swanson,He's suing me.
Ron Swanson,Apparently councilman Jeremy Jamm is not pleased that I punched him in the face on the night of Leslie's wedding.
Ron Swanson,Neither.
Ron Swanson,I'm a parent.
Ron Swanson,It's no trouble at all.
Ron Swanson,But I respect the effort.
Ron Swanson,"That's a kind offer, Andrew, but I won't be hiring an attorney."
Ron Swanson,I don't like you.
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron Swanson!
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Diane."
Ron Swanson,I'll be out here if you need me.
Ron Swanson,Can I take a message?
Ron Swanson,He stepped out.
Ron Swanson,My exwife Tammy two.
Ron Swanson,I want this night to get Krazzy.
Ron Swanson,She's here.
Ron Swanson,Not me.
Ron Swanson,"I'm coming home soon to relieve you, give you a little break."
Ron Swanson,"I'll represent myself, as I do in all legal matters and livestock auctions."
Ron Swanson,"I'm getting some for a 30-year-old who works for me, so I can bring some home for you too."
Ron Swanson,Aghh!
Ron Swanson,"In 1994, I gave her a nickname."
Ron Swanson,"It's unrepeatable, but it stuck."
Ron Swanson,It's my proudest accomplishment.
Ron Swanson,"It's ""The Iron [bleep] of Pawnee."""
Ron Swanson,I don't know what the hell these other crackpots are doing.
Ron Swanson,My mind was blank.
Ron Swanson,There were no thoughts in my head whatsoever.
Ron Swanson,"I just stood there, quietly breathing."
Ron Swanson,"And no, I was not meditating."
Ron Swanson,I can smell the sulfur coming off her cloven hooves.
Ron Swanson,An athletic competition where both parties are competing their hardest is certainly more honorable than whatever this charade is.
Ron Swanson,"All told, we were in there about six hours."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"My only official recommendations are U.S. Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton Salt, and the C.R Laurence Fein two inch, axe style scraper oscillating knife blade."
Ron Swanson,I won't publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively and I really believe in it.
Ron Swanson,"This way, please."
Ron Swanson,I hear it has a dope aftertaste.
Ron Swanson,Get me a shot of Snake Juice.
Ron Swanson,I want this night to get crazy.
Ron Swanson,"Setting up for our press conference, which will take place immediately after yours."
Ron Swanson,"April, could you call maintenance please?"
Ron Swanson,Get me a refill.
Ron Swanson,Councilwoman.
Ron Swanson,It's ensconced forever in the shadowbox we made earlier.
Ron Swanson,"Son, we spent four days making that."
Ron Swanson,"Literally everything is a weapon, son."
Ron Swanson,"That folder, in my hands, is far deadlier than this bow in yours."
Ron Swanson,That's your will?
Ron Swanson,"You need that many pages to say, ""Give my stuff to my wife""?"
Ron Swanson,It doesn't have to be.
Ron Swanson,I've had the same will since I was eight years old.
Ron Swanson,"But so much is changing, and I've never been a fan of change."
Ron Swanson,Salvatore was a constant in my life.
Ron Swanson,Oh [bleep].
Ron Swanson,Collie was the fourth round.
Ron Swanson,No need to discuss any further.
Ron Swanson,The man who kills me will know.
Ron Swanson,Ms. Porter.
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, stop speaking to this man."
Ron Swanson,He is the worst human being on Earth.
Ron Swanson,This is from the Isle of Islay in Scotland.
Ron Swanson,This is as eastern as my wisdom gets.
Ron Swanson,I hate you so much.
Ron Swanson,"So, she's found something to strengthen her bid."
Ron Swanson,"The three most useless jobs in the world are, in order, lawyer, congressman, and doctor."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, who is this person?"
Ron Swanson,They really do.
Ron Swanson,You will be the face of the Gryzzl bid.
Ron Swanson,It's like a fairy tale.
Ron Swanson,And then he'd always ask me about the same thing.
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,It was perfect.
Ron Swanson,I can't delay this forever.
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Ron Swanson,"The three most important people in a man's life are his barber, his butcher and his lover."
Ron Swanson,I have lost one of those.
Ron Swanson,"Here's a tenner, Sal."
Ron Swanson,"As you know I don't believe in tipping, so I will collect my change from your wife."
Ron Swanson,I had an appointment with Salvatore scheduled for Tuesday.
Ron Swanson,Look how raggedy my hair is.
Ron Swanson,"What am I supposed to be, some kind of rock star?"
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Mark."
Ron Swanson,"This is Beth, my exwife Tammy's better looking sister."
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Ron Swanson,My exwife Tammy cheated on me.
Ron Swanson,Then we divorced.
Ron Swanson,What's going on?
Ron Swanson,"Andy, this was delicious."
Ron Swanson,"Then last week, I ran into her sister Beth here."
Ron Swanson,"Turns out she hates Tammy, too, so we've started dating."
Ron Swanson,Pass.
Ron Swanson,"I sat in the same chair, Salvatore put the same cape over me."
Ron Swanson,A press conference?
Ron Swanson,Where is this lawyer you speak of?
Ron Swanson,Euro trash.
Ron Swanson,I like that.
Ron Swanson,"It is, indeed, a garbage continent."
Ron Swanson,"I like your hairdo, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"Please, talk more about how you hate Europe and bicycles."
Ron Swanson,That's [bleep] milk.
Ron Swanson,"Apology accepted, and then I have no reaction to anything else you said."
Ron Swanson,"You wrote him an email about riding your dragons to Pelennor Fields and signed it ""Dimple Broadbelt of Buckland."""
Ron Swanson,Who is Todo Toadfoot?
Ron Swanson,No further questions.
Ron Swanson,"Go, team!"
Ron Swanson,We're all going out together.
Ron Swanson,You don't know what you're talking about. What are you doing here?
Ron Swanson,There is only Doc McStuffins.
Ron Swanson,There is no quiet anymore.
Ron Swanson,"Silence, the absence of noise, one single moment undisturbed by the sounds of a children's TV program called Doc McStuffins."
Ron Swanson,"I love being a father, but there are a few things I miss."
Ron Swanson,Spending the day outside alone sounds like a dream.
Ron Swanson,Mmmhmm.
Ron Swanson,Ugh.
Ron Swanson,I really don't need--
Ron Swanson,"So, Typhoon, what do you like to do for fun?"
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Ron Swanson,"I'd go to a banquet and honor of those Somali pirates, if they served bacon wrapped shrimp."
Ron Swanson,"Terry, what is Leslie up to?"
Ron Swanson,Absolutely.
Ron Swanson,How is Leslie doing with her quest?
Ron Swanson,"Come on, we better get you to a dentist."
Ron Swanson,Are you hurt?
Ron Swanson,Unless That's exactly what she wants me to do.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I'm just gonna leave early and go home.
Ron Swanson,I'm ending this right now.
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's my birthday on Friday."
Ron Swanson,I don't want to get into it.
Ron Swanson,"No, it has nothing to do with her work."
Ron Swanson,"Send Leslie somewhere on an assignment, a conference or something, and make her take April and freeze their bank accounts."
Ron Swanson,With pleasure.
Ron Swanson,Stop talking and get out.
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,I enjoy government functions like I enjoy getting kicked in the nuggets with a steeltoe boot.
Ron Swanson,There's a rumor going around that Chris has a killer witness.
Ron Swanson,But this hotel always serves bacon wrapped shrimp.
Ron Swanson,Tom?
Ron Swanson,That's my number one favorite food wrapped around my number three favorite food.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you about ready to go, my love?"
Ron Swanson,I paid him $8.
Ron Swanson,Same exact thing every time.
Ron Swanson,I've seen Salvatore the first Tuesday of the month for the past four decades.
Ron Swanson,"Well, my grandmother was missing that tooth, and she was the most beautiful woman on her oil rig."
Ron Swanson,Don't you want to get your tooth fixed?
Ron Swanson,And can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklings?
Ron Swanson,Let us know how it went.
Ron Swanson,Goody.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, take him out and shoot him."
Ron Swanson,Catching the number 12 bus to Satan's butthole?
Ron Swanson,"No kidding, Donna."
Ron Swanson,Tammy One.
Ron Swanson,You are an adult.
Ron Swanson,Those are two completely different pictures.
Ron Swanson,"If you're all right, I'm gonna head back to the park."
Ron Swanson,The receptionist says she'll fit you in as soon as there's an opening.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I respect that, see you later."
Ron Swanson,I am putting him down.
Ron Swanson,A fine trophy.
Ron Swanson,I think I'll keep it in the office.
Ron Swanson,He is now peeing.
Ron Swanson,"I get it, I get it, what's the point?"
Ron Swanson,What was your favorite part of that?
Ron Swanson,All I wanted was two hours where I got to forget that I was a parent.
Ron Swanson,I am not your dad.
Ron Swanson,Give me it.
Ron Swanson,We're gonna spend 11 days in my cabin in the woods.
Ron Swanson,I'll stand.
Ron Swanson,What about that giant list of things April was doing?
Ron Swanson,"That's really good, son."
Ron Swanson,"Ann said you had a big party, sombreros, karaoke."
Ron Swanson,I didn't do anything for my office.
Ron Swanson,Let's get this over with.
Ron Swanson,Made from the finest corn ever grown on American soil.
Ron Swanson,That's Swanson family mash liquor.
Ron Swanson,Why is there a gorilla guarding this gingerbread house?
Ron Swanson,I like where I am.
Ron Swanson,"I'm very grateful, Chris, but I think I'm going to turn down the job."
Ron Swanson,"After I steal this cable feed, I will repay the cable company for the service we used."
Ron Swanson,It's fine.
Ron Swanson,What exactly will you be cutting?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, it's done, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,And how much of it?
Ron Swanson,"Tammy and I are in love, and we're gonna start a family together."
Ron Swanson,"If you want to go, we can go."
Ron Swanson,"In fact, she's ovulating."
Ron Swanson,It doesn't look like much.
Ron Swanson,"So if you'll excuse us, we're heading off on our honeymoon."
Ron Swanson,You rented Rashomon?
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, please."
Ron Swanson,That would be like giving food to a mortally wounded animal instead of slitting its throat and properly utilizing its meat and pelt.
Ron Swanson,The government should not prop up a failed business.
Ron Swanson,"Look, I love a good dog as much as the next guy, but this building doesn't allow animals."
Ron Swanson,What's going on here?
Ron Swanson,I like Andy.
Ron Swanson,You are an unstoppable good idea machine!
Ron Swanson,Have you told anyone?
Ron Swanson,"Bye, Zuzu."
Ron Swanson,And there are some pretty intellectual conversations down at Barrett's Hardware.
Ron Swanson,"This is a bailout, and I don't like it."
Ron Swanson,"His business is failing, and you're bailing it out."
Ron Swanson,He is not up to snuff.
Ron Swanson,This man is a failure.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, I'm leaving."
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, son."
Ron Swanson,Don't recall.
Ron Swanson,"I was talking to Andy about you, and he made me realize that I need you back at work."
Ron Swanson,That sounds like the government meddling in private enterprise.
Ron Swanson,I want you to come back.
Ron Swanson,Come back.
Ron Swanson,Come back to work.
Ron Swanson,It's a whole new meat delivery system.
Ron Swanson,"Andy, take him outside."
Ron Swanson,"Last frame, go."
Ron Swanson,"No, it can't be."
Ron Swanson,Explain yourself.
Ron Swanson,Allow me to elaborate.
Ron Swanson,"And I, for one, refuse to let her turn this town into a socialist hellscape."
Ron Swanson,This action by Councilwoman Knope is nothing more than a thinly veiled government bailout.
Ron Swanson,"No, I am here to express an opinion."
Ron Swanson,What did this little birdie tell you is going to happen for my birthday?
Ron Swanson,I slept here.
Ron Swanson,He is peeing.
Ron Swanson,I'm holding the dog.
Ron Swanson,Just keep him outside.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Andy, wait up!"
Ron Swanson,"Hup, hup, hup!"
Ron Swanson,"Death is natural, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,And that includes the men.
Ron Swanson,I'm surrounded by a lot of women in this department.
Ron Swanson,"We're born, we survive as long as we're useful, and then we're killed, either by our body's natural decay or by those younger and stronger."
Ron Swanson,Carl.
Ron Swanson,"Donna, Andy, this is Carl."
Ron Swanson,He owns the deli right next to my barber Salvatore's shop.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,What happened?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Last frame, your turn."
Ron Swanson,We haven't finished yet.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Well, Paul just called."
Ron Swanson,They're on their way.
Ron Swanson,Straight down the middle.
Ron Swanson,"No hook, no spin, no fuss."
Ron Swanson,Anything more and this becomes figure skating.
Ron Swanson,"Son, people can see you."
Ron Swanson,Fourth floor.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, gents."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Let us out immediately.
Ron Swanson,Felt like I had outgrown it.
Ron Swanson,I was 12 years old.
Ron Swanson,Epic and private.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,And hazelnuts.
Ron Swanson,Cowardice and weak willed men.
Ron Swanson,"You can wait at that table, and someone will be here sometime."
Ron Swanson,I have an uncle who does yoga.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Lovemaking and woodworking.
Ron Swanson,Never went again.
Ron Swanson,No!
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"You're welcome, Steve."
Ron Swanson,The only thing the voters need to know about you is your name.
Ron Swanson,Allison and I already had a good talk about the power of the hard earned dollar.
Ron Swanson,"You're wasting your time, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,""" I wrote ""tom."
Ron Swanson,"And even that, I go back and forth on."
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, he's right."
Ron Swanson,Well said.
Ron Swanson,I appreciate it.
Ron Swanson,That's John Locke.
Ron Swanson,"""Life, liberty, and property."""
Ron Swanson,Let's get started.
Ron Swanson,"Don't sass me, Burkiss."
Ron Swanson,"Lauren, my name is Ron Swanson, and I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know about the miserable, screwedup world of local government."
Ron Swanson,"What's your name, ma'am?"
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need a different metaphor to give this nine year old.
Ron Swanson,"It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teat until they have sore, chapped nipples."
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,What's it on?
Ron Swanson,It's unsettling having you just sit there.
Ron Swanson,"Look, little girl, can we postpone this for another day?"
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,You don't have to tell them a damn thing.
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Ron Swanson,One.
Ron Swanson,"All we're asking is that you meet with her, and seriously consider her for the job."
Ron Swanson,"Well, this is uncomfortable."
Ron Swanson,What the [bleep]?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,You're not that good at scrapbooking.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I had hoped you'd choose a more dignified trade like masonry or logging."
Ron Swanson,"But you are out of local government, and that's a step in the right direction."
Ron Swanson,Well.
Ron Swanson,"She is an exceptional human being, who married a well meaning goofball."
Ron Swanson,Then bully for you.
Ron Swanson,"The one I gave you years ago when you were my assistant, for emergencies."
Ron Swanson,Good talk.
Ron Swanson,"I have had a cold before, I need no help, so if you don't mind"
Ron Swanson,I am a grown man.
Ron Swanson,Please turn the thermostat up to 90 and leave me alone.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for your concern, I will be fine."
Ron Swanson,I was wrong.
Ron Swanson,"The children were sniffling, which I believed to be due to the sad nature of the film."
Ron Swanson,"Last night, I watched a movie with Diane and the girls in which an orange fish is separated from his father."
Ron Swanson,"If you intend to move, I suppose you should return the spare key to my house."
Ron Swanson,Please don't hold anything Andy did against April.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, I'm asking you as a man to stop this immediately."
Ron Swanson,Where are you going?
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Ron Swanson,Only when I'm losing.
Ron Swanson,Which is true.
Ron Swanson,I suffer from a disorder called sleep fighting.
Ron Swanson,I answered some of them.
Ron Swanson,"Picked her up in my truck, we slow-danced to a Merle Haggard song, and then I left early to go to my shift at the quarry."
Ron Swanson,I attended prom with Susan Hofler.
Ron Swanson,It is intended for welding and filling air ships.
Ron Swanson,I'd like to object again to being brought here against my will.
Ron Swanson,Stop wasting helium.
Ron Swanson,"They try to learn something from it, and they move on."
Ron Swanson,"When a good person does something bad, they own up to it."
Ron Swanson,You know what makes a good person good?
Ron Swanson,I'll give you $40.
Ron Swanson,Would like to help me screw some angle irons onto some 2x4s?
Ron Swanson,I was subcontracted by the government to construct a lighting rig.
Ron Swanson,It's not that simple.
Ron Swanson,Allison.
Ron Swanson,"No, you're not."
Ron Swanson,I'm your boss.
Ron Swanson,One shelf.
Ron Swanson,But thank you.
Ron Swanson,That does not apply to this situation at all.
Ron Swanson,I am only here because I owe Leslie a thousand favors.
Ron Swanson,We use the Towsend Method.
Ron Swanson,It's tried and true.
Ron Swanson,I think you might be right.
Ron Swanson,But getting a good person out of government is a worthwhile endeavor.
Ron Swanson,I will help.
Ron Swanson,"But first, I'm going to need some grub."
Ron Swanson,Vaughn.
Ron Swanson,Lon.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"No, that's insane."
Ron Swanson,Over.
Ron Swanson,I wanted to let you all know that I will be throwing the annual Parks Department employee appreciation barbecue.
Ron Swanson,I've got this covered.
Ron Swanson,Watch the cage.
Ron Swanson,He's not joking.
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Last name?
Ron Swanson,You go keep your eye out for Tom.
Ron Swanson,"Is that your name, or are you telling me you're finished talking?"
Ron Swanson,Dunn and done.
Ron Swanson,"When recaning an old chair, one needs to make sure that one has all the right elements in place."
Ron Swanson,"Although I suppose she could use ""creative"" ways to organize and stack the vinyl sheeting."
Ron Swanson,Creativity is for people with glasses who like to lie.
Ron Swanson,It's a largescale storage unit for surplus vinyl sheeting.
Ron Swanson,Use that to protect your property.
Ron Swanson,This is a Claymore land mine.
Ron Swanson,"Hang on, hang on, I have something for you."
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ron Swanson,"You are, and this is not a joke, much smarter than most of the people who work in this building."
Ron Swanson,I've really enjoyed talking with you.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I guess it's time for you to head home."
Ron Swanson,"And that, Lauren, is how FDR ruined this country."
Ron Swanson,Under.
Ron Swanson,Over.
Ron Swanson,Over.
Ron Swanson,And you guessed it.
Ron Swanson,She'll be assistant to the head mulcher.
Ron Swanson,"I just spoke with Tim Hautner from the sawmill on my mobile telephone, and he's offering Allison a paying job."
Ron Swanson,Under.
Ron Swanson,"You're finished, Knope."
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ron Swanson,"Well, she'd have about six people reporting to her."
Ron Swanson,"When people get too chummy with me, I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don't really care about them."
Ron Swanson,"If she started soon, she could project manage our new warehouse in Snerling."
Ron Swanson,Capital gains tax.
Ron Swanson,Uhoh.
Ron Swanson,You think this Barney fellow will listen to what we have to say?
Ron Swanson,You're learning.
Ron Swanson,Why are you sitting weird?
Ron Swanson,Watch the cage.
Ron Swanson,"I assembled that cage and was paid for my labor, and I will use the money to buy shelter, fuel, and medicine."
Ron Swanson,Wendy and I are over.
Ron Swanson,"No, look at the cage that is holding all of those balloons."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,She's moving back to Canada.
Ron Swanson,It's too bad.
Ron Swanson,I just taught her how to whittle.
Ron Swanson,She made me this tiny sharpened stick.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Fishing is not that hard.
Ron Swanson,He's a grown man.
Ron Swanson,"Don't teach a man to fish, and you feed yourself."
Ron Swanson,We need to highlight April's strengths.
Ron Swanson,I thought we could update her resume.
Ron Swanson,This is the one she applied to Parks with.
Ron Swanson,It's just a signed photograph of a puppet named Alf.
Ron Swanson,"Please, no."
Ron Swanson,"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day."
Ron Swanson,I'm not big on charities.
Ron Swanson,"When I eat, it is the food that is scared."
Ron Swanson,"Usually, I take it neat, but I will make an exception in the name of health."
Ron Swanson,You're only as good as your word.
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,"But here I come, the government, and I get to take 40% of your lunch. And that, Lauren, is how taxes work."
Ron Swanson,"If you wanna throw it away in the garbage, that's your prerogative."
Ron Swanson,I like Ron.
Ron Swanson,"If you wanna eat all of it, great."
Ron Swanson,"Now, you should be able to do whatever you want to with this, right?"
Ron Swanson,This is your lunch.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Ron Swanson,Not interested.
Ron Swanson,"And worse, you're deliberately losing."
Ron Swanson,Just blow.
Ron Swanson,It's sawdust.
Ron Swanson,You could at least use mahogany.
Ron Swanson,Balsa wood?
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,"I need you to explain everything you do before you do it, so I can determine whether I will allow you Oh!"
Ron Swanson,"Before you begin, a few ground rules."
Ron Swanson,Losing on purpose is a form of lying.
Ron Swanson,April Ludgate-Dwyer.
Ron Swanson,She worked on the Gryzzl deal that you guys did the finances for.
Ron Swanson,Son.
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Ron Swanson,This bowling alley has my favorite restaurant in pawnee.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you tell me what she did for your last birthday?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, plenty."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have had just about enough of your stubborn behavior."
Ron Swanson,It's time for Tammy and me to bury the hatchet once and for all.
Ron Swanson,Everything will be fine.
Ron Swanson,I wasn't thinking at all.
Ron Swanson,Right there.
Ron Swanson,Right there.
Ron Swanson,Jerry forgot to vote.
Ron Swanson,"Wendy loves it, too."
Ron Swanson,"Drink this, now."
Ron Swanson,"Son, you should know that my recommendation is essentially a guarantee."
Ron Swanson,Don't try so hard.
Ron Swanson,Don't do that.
Ron Swanson,"In general, I try never to speak with people, but I have been drinking this Snake Juice thing, and it's damn good."
Ron Swanson,"We get the picture, son."
Ron Swanson,Congratulations.
Ron Swanson,Just daydreaming about punching Jamm in the face.
Ron Swanson,"If it were me, I would have just punched him in the face."
Ron Swanson,Bully for you.
Ron Swanson,My name is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,He looks like he could use a swift punch in the face though.
Ron Swanson,Never met him.
Ron Swanson,You should buy it.
Ron Swanson,But I'll support you either way.
Ron Swanson,"Chris, wait."
Ron Swanson,"I know this crap is important to you, so I should come clean."
Ron Swanson,"And boy, oh, boy, did you love Andy."
Ron Swanson,"""Woof, woof."""
Ron Swanson,It really is embarrassing.
Ron Swanson,How'd you remember?
Ron Swanson,Why here?
Ron Swanson,"I have always felt a certain kinship with April, and this is proof that I was correct."
Ron Swanson,"Not the nice things she said about me, the fact that I buried a large amount of gold under that same tree years ago."
Ron Swanson,I would like to punch you in the face again.
Ron Swanson,I have since moved it.
Ron Swanson,Or have I?
Ron Swanson,"But first, there's a hot, spinning cone of meat in that Greek restaurant next door."
Ron Swanson,I do.
Ron Swanson,The end.
Ron Swanson,I regret nothing.
Ron Swanson,"And when I punched him, he dropped so quickly, I thought he was diving towards the ground."
Ron Swanson,"He's incredibly frail, and his arms are weak."
Ron Swanson,"Truthfully, I barely registered his attack."
Ron Swanson,"And instead, he attacked me twice."
Ron Swanson,"On the night I punched councilman Jamm in the face, I warned him several times to back off."
Ron Swanson,So if you're looking for someone who enjoys meditation
Ron Swanson,I got nothing out of that experience at all.
Ron Swanson,Who's that gentleman?
Ron Swanson,Not the least of which is that you created a puzzle that even I couldn't solve.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,It's just the way I'm standing.
Ron Swanson,How will people ever respect me?
Ron Swanson,What if that testimony leaks?
Ron Swanson,You even called me a vegetarian.
Ron Swanson,And neither was yours.
Ron Swanson,But it wasn't the truth.
Ron Swanson,"Go back to the library, where you belong."
Ron Swanson,"Knope, what are these contracts?"
Ron Swanson,Please do your jobs.
Ron Swanson,And it was far preferable to spending another second with you.
Ron Swanson,I've made my point.
Ron Swanson,Leslie has made hers.
Ron Swanson,"Which way are you voting, Councilman?"
Ron Swanson,We need to win it.
Ron Swanson,You have lost your mind.
Ron Swanson,This is a competition.
Ron Swanson,The only reason anybody's going to this thing is because they're afraid of what Marlene'll do to them if they don't.
Ron Swanson,I'm more of a whiskey man.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Ron Swanson,Why are you doing this?
Ron Swanson,You could both take a lesson from Andrew.
Ron Swanson,"He told the truth about everything he was asked, even when it was humiliating for him."
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,A triple crib-- sounds like an interesting woodworking challenge.
Ron Swanson,Congratulate us.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, yeah."
Ron Swanson,"Would you like oak or pine? I'll make both, and you can choose."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,But don't tell her I told you.
Ron Swanson,You can go visit her tomorrow morning.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, she's fine."
Ron Swanson,"April's in the hospital, sick with the flu."
Ron Swanson,What are you talking about?
Ron Swanson,"Damn, if that isn't delicious."
Ron Swanson,Hit me.
Ron Swanson,"But more importantly, you've dishonored yourselves."
Ron Swanson,You committed perjury.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I'd like to see that."
Ron Swanson,"I'm gonna call you both back in that room, and you'll recant your testimony."
Ron Swanson,"If you're looking for trouble, take it somewhere else."
Ron Swanson,I don't like to get involved in people's personal
Ron Swanson,"An hour ago, a giant fireball consumed my entire face."
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you will both raise a wonderful child with whom I will profoundly disagree on nearly everything.
Ron Swanson,For many reasons.
Ron Swanson,I will be sorry to see you leave this town.
Ron Swanson,What matters is that I trust you and admire you as a person.
Ron Swanson,"Tim Hautner, who owns the sawmill out on Lowell Drive, is a personal friend."
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,"You don't know what you're mixed up in, son."
Ron Swanson,This isn't about you.
Ron Swanson,It's about me.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you get a paying job for the summer?
Ron Swanson,I respect your father too much to let his daughter work for free for the government.
Ron Swanson,Amen.
Ron Swanson,He's just a kid chasing a goofy dream.
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,He's not savvy enough to manipulate the system like that.
Ron Swanson,That doesn't make any sense to me.
Ron Swanson,"Tom tries to get off the government teat, and we punish him."
Ron Swanson,They must have moved it during the remodel.
Ron Swanson,It's probably in basement storage.
Ron Swanson,To the basement!
Ron Swanson,"Do what, exactly?"
Ron Swanson,"Boys, think."
Ron Swanson,We are on a quest and we are not leaving until we get an answer.
Ron Swanson,I think I have the answer.
Ron Swanson,Tom's not scamming anyone.
Ron Swanson,To the shoeshine stand!
Ron Swanson,Or April doing anything unusual that day?
Ron Swanson,Do you remember anything about a key?
Ron Swanson,I built his sawmill.
Ron Swanson,I once did him a favor.
Ron Swanson,I see.
Ron Swanson,It's an impossible puzzle.
Ron Swanson,And I love puzzles.
Ron Swanson,"A minimal, unhelpful note, these appear to be human teeth."
Ron Swanson,And what is this?
Ron Swanson,Twilight: New Moon?
Ron Swanson,Donna likes those things.
Ron Swanson,Dollars to donuts this points us her way.
Ron Swanson,"Finally, a scavenger hunt worthy of my time."
Ron Swanson,Onward!
Ron Swanson,I'm sure I can get Allison a job at Tim Hautner's sawmill.
Ron Swanson,But I draw the line at corrupting America's youth.
Ron Swanson,I have tolerated Leslie's pro-government ways because her annoying kindness and generosity sneakily made me like her as a person.
Ron Swanson,He's always looking for bright young employees to give money to in exchange for honest work.
Ron Swanson,We have a wonderfully small number of clues.
Ron Swanson,One is this ticket.
Ron Swanson,Did you see this movie about vampires and such?
Ron Swanson,The teeth.
Ron Swanson,They're yours.
Ron Swanson,The chase continues!
Ron Swanson,I am very angry right now.
Ron Swanson,So let me get this straight.
Ron Swanson,What in God's name is freegan vegan?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, Joe seems like a good man, but at this point, I'm done talking about him."
Ron Swanson,You take that back.
Ron Swanson,"You have no interest in government work, and you slow everything down with your selfish attitude."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, leave him out of this."
Ron Swanson,"First, you take the cow to the killing floor"
Ron Swanson,The protein soaks up the sugar.
Ron Swanson,Eat up.
Ron Swanson,I brought some burgers and fries.
Ron Swanson,"Top of the morning, everyone."
Ron Swanson,Allison's father owns the hardware store I've been going to since before Allison was even born.
Ron Swanson,"And two years later, they banned missionary."
Ron Swanson,"In 1856, the city council banned all sexual positions except for missionary."
Ron Swanson,"I'd love for you to stick around, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,Is this everybody?
Ron Swanson,It'll be damn hard to replace you.
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman!"
Ron Swanson,Just crawl back into the dank hole you came from and leave my friends alone.
Ron Swanson,Allison Gliffert.
Ron Swanson,"I don't know what it is, but I'd like to eat the whole thing."
Ron Swanson,I change my house locks every 16 days.
Ron Swanson,That key has been useless since the second Tuesday after I gave it to you.
Ron Swanson,Glad to hear it.
Ron Swanson,"Ever since the Morningstar incident, you have been completely unreasonable."
Ron Swanson,Much obliged.
Ron Swanson,What brings you to the festering putrid stink hole on the armpit of freedom?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"What is on your foot, sir?"
Ron Swanson,It was an accident.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, my God, do you have any pride at all?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson,"If you don't mind, Councilman Milton, we just need to search this stand."
Ron Swanson,"""Hi Andy, I hate people, but you are okay"""
Ron Swanson,"""It's weird."""
Ron Swanson,"""Woof, woof."""
Ron Swanson,I no longer like Ron.
Ron Swanson,"""April."""
Ron Swanson,But I do know how many pounds of money I have.
Ron Swanson,I'm actually not sure how much money I have.
Ron Swanson,I think so.
Ron Swanson,I also have some money in palladium.
Ron Swanson,Do you know if one can pay court-ordered settlements in gold? All of my money's in gold.
Ron Swanson,I intend to do as the court orders.
Ron Swanson,That's it.
Ron Swanson,See me in my office.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you don't have to do this"
Ron Swanson,It was exactly as substantive as your presentation.
Ron Swanson,Go with your gut.
Ron Swanson,"I mean, you spend so much time worrying about this park, but really, who cares?"
Ron Swanson,Without having to reset the fence.
Ron Swanson,I guess it just slipped through the cracks.
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Carl."
Ron Swanson,Looking sharp.
Ron Swanson,They just boarded her up like she was some common warehouse.
Ron Swanson,Really.
Ron Swanson,"Yep, you got it."
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I'm tightening the valve stem into the valve shank.
Ron Swanson,I'm replacing the handle.
Ron Swanson,This is an elk hair.
Ron Swanson,Beautiful.
Ron Swanson,"And then tightening the set screw, which will hold it in place."
Ron Swanson,Now
Ron Swanson,It's a good feeling.
Ron Swanson,"Diane, that's my chair, right there."
Ron Swanson,A sense of accomplishment and pride.
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, I just love it so much."
Ron Swanson,Great.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna go around this house and fix everything I can find that needs fixing.
Ron Swanson,You wanna help?
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure I stand a chance.
Ron Swanson,Have some perspective.
Ron Swanson,"Really, but I don't want it."
Ron Swanson,You just violated rules number one and three.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie Knope, builder of parks."
Ron Swanson,How was canvassing?
Ron Swanson,Postpone?
Ron Swanson,Don't need it.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I don't need your approval.
Ron Swanson,You're doing this meeting.
Ron Swanson,You have my full support.
Ron Swanson,"I was talking to the city manager, exchanging ideas."
Ron Swanson,You lose your coffee privileges.
Ron Swanson,"Um, there's a mutual respect there."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,You don't deserve to wear it.
Ron Swanson,"Well, it is, but you're an ass [Bleep]."
Ron Swanson,"No, it's happening."
Ron Swanson,"Look, just do a good job tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,Okay?
Ron Swanson,We have to push this thing through.
Ron Swanson,Are you sweating through your suit?
Ron Swanson,The backboard is your friend.
Ron Swanson,"And together, we have decided to fast-track your project."
Ron Swanson,"She's here, isn't she?"
Ron Swanson,You flew all this way.
Ron Swanson,I can't believe there's even a flight?
Ron Swanson,"Welcome to the Indiana Fine Woodworking Awards, or as I like to call it, heaven."
Ron Swanson,But a man who's this worried about making all the right choices cares very much.
Ron Swanson,That's all that matters.
Ron Swanson,"Thanks, Tom."
Ron Swanson,You'll be a great father.
Ron Swanson,You want some help?
Ron Swanson,Whose hair is that?
Ron Swanson,Does the white whale actually symbolize the unknowability and meaninglessness of human existence? No.
Ron Swanson,It's just a [bleep] fish.
Ron Swanson,And that toxic crib you bought won't be the last mistake you make.
Ron Swanson,Fishing it is.
Ron Swanson,Good morning.
Ron Swanson,"Do you fish, April?"
Ron Swanson,Let me give you a piece of fishing advice.
Ron Swanson,"No, no."
Ron Swanson,"I said I don't When you have a fish on the line, you don't just drag it behind the boat."
Ron Swanson,You either reel it in or you cut him loose.
Ron Swanson,"They just forgot to unlock the door, that's all."
Ron Swanson,"Look, friend, I respect your slavish devotion to the free market, but you can't welch on a contract."
Ron Swanson,Take this uniform off.
Ron Swanson,"Yep, you truly are attempting to do it all."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do not think you should leave Europe right now."
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Ron Swanson,"Nobody has all the right answers in parenting, including me."
Ron Swanson,The crib I built.
Ron Swanson,I'm giving it to you and Ann.
Ron Swanson,It's perfectly safe.
Ron Swanson,I tested it by hitting it with my truck.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you choose, Knope hunting, fishing, or drinking?"
Ron Swanson,"Ooh, if you ladies will excuse me, there is a jack plane that needs my attention."
Ron Swanson,"No, I'm sure he gets swamped with attention all the time."
Ron Swanson,There's more than one crib tree in a forest.
Ron Swanson,I never dreamed that I would see him in the flesh.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, may I present Diane Lewis?"
Ron Swanson,He's the modern master of the Shaker style.
Ron Swanson,"Mary, mother of God."
Ron Swanson,"That's not a lesson, by the way, just a comment on lumber availability."
Ron Swanson,That's next.
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,It's brown.
Ron Swanson,"So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake."
Ron Swanson,Be my guest.
Ron Swanson,But did they ask you to bring a vegetable loaf or a cake?
Ron Swanson,"Diane, this is Leslie Knope."
Ron Swanson,That's Christian Becksvoort!
Ron Swanson,"Especially if he's a nice fish with a big, lovable fish heart."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, this is Diane."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Tom has changed.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Ron Swanson,"You've been gone for a while, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,That's the old Tom.
Ron Swanson,I'm ejected?
Ron Swanson,He picked up the laser and stared right into it.
Ron Swanson,That was Larry's fault.
Ron Swanson,"I'd be honored to, son."
Ron Swanson,I know more than you.
Ron Swanson,"He ran a business, sold it for a profit."
Ron Swanson,"When April and Andy married, I didn't get them a wedding present."
Ron Swanson,"In my experience, wedding presents are nothing more than kindling on a divorce bonfire."
Ron Swanson,"I'm the last person to want to deprive the world of more stew, but are you sure you wanna do this?"
Ron Swanson,"Two, three."
Ron Swanson,I am giving you a non-electronic book made of paper from a tree.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, look."
Ron Swanson,"So, where are you gonna put it?"
Ron Swanson,Carnage!
Ron Swanson,They cropped you out.
Ron Swanson,I'm tired of not being married to this woman.
Ron Swanson,But they'd be less stupid if they went to the right people.
Ron Swanson,The wedding's in four minutes.
Ron Swanson,"Don't worry, Leslie will deal with this and the sinkhole."
Ron Swanson,Come on in.
Ron Swanson,Uh There it is.
Ron Swanson,"Uh, thank you for this Uh, this all good night good."
Ron Swanson,"I made my first chair when I was five, but the quality of the wood was wanting, so when I turned nine, I used my factory wages to purchase some beautiful local walnut."
Ron Swanson,This award is the only one I'd ever give a damn about.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I didn't ask.
Ron Swanson,That doesn't mean it's over.
Ron Swanson,Are those women's sneakers?
Ron Swanson,"Right, Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna stay here, there are three rules you need to follow."
Ron Swanson,"Two, no talk about Ben."
Ron Swanson,Great job.
Ron Swanson,"Look, I know they've given you a hard time."
Ron Swanson,"Now, be a man, and sit on that girl's lap."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, we're already late."
Ron Swanson,There's no coin toss in basketball.
Ron Swanson,I certainly do.
Ron Swanson,"At some point, you're gonna have to trust him to do his job."
Ron Swanson,"He's also been working here for six years, and he's learned a lot from you."
Ron Swanson,"One, no talk about Tammy one."
Ron Swanson,"Diane, this is a piece of human garbage named Tammy, who is also my exwife."
Ron Swanson,I still think awards are stupid.
Ron Swanson,Shortest possible ceremony.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,"""Hey! You fast-tracked that, right?"""
Ron Swanson,Impossible.
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,There's a new wind blowing in government and I don't like it.
Ron Swanson,I'm not done with the chairs yet.
Ron Swanson,It is my belief that you never start a job you don't intend to finish.
Ron Swanson,"All of a sudden, there's all this federal money coming in, and Paul, the city manager, is telling us to build parks and start new community programs."
Ron Swanson,Great.
Ron Swanson,It's horrifying.
Ron Swanson,We're just building a crib.
Ron Swanson,Carnage!
Ron Swanson,Or yours.
Ron Swanson,It's not really my place.
Ron Swanson,You should take it.
Ron Swanson,Is that that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza?
Ron Swanson,Metaphors? I hate metaphors.
Ron Swanson,"That's why my favorite book is Moby Dick-- no froufrou symbolism, just a good, simple tale about a man who hates an animal."
Ron Swanson,"That's enough for today, I think."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, I'm not teaching you anything."
Ron Swanson,"I have something for you, son."
Ron Swanson,We have a public forum tomorrow.
Ron Swanson,What can I do for you?
Ron Swanson,I didn't think so.
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,But I think I found a way I can really help them make a home.
Ron Swanson,"Three, no talk."
Ron Swanson,"You, beanbag, come with me."
Ron Swanson,You've done--
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Ron Swanson,Come with me.
Ron Swanson,"When the mayor gets here, we'll do the photo-op, they'll be out of our hair, you'll get to build your park."
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, absolutely."
Ron Swanson,I'll take care of this trespasser.
Ron Swanson,"Belay that order, Carl."
Ron Swanson,"If a joint is properly fashioned, all you need to do is guide it into place."
Ron Swanson,After that whole conversation--
Ron Swanson,Yeah?
Ron Swanson,Nah.
Ron Swanson,You don't even know where it is.
Ron Swanson,It's unstable.
Ron Swanson,It's no good.
Ron Swanson,"Uh, sure, Paul."
Ron Swanson,I need small hands.
Ron Swanson,"You tried to shoot the moon, and you came up short."
Ron Swanson,Maybe not.
Ron Swanson,Maybe moving to Indianapolis just to get revenge on him is a really good idea.
Ron Swanson,Hmmâ¦
Ron Swanson,"""Regal Meagle Realty."""
Ron Swanson,Let me finish.
Ron Swanson,"So, five courses."
Ron Swanson,"I used to work in a sheet metal factory, but then a job came along at the tannery."
Ron Swanson,"The hours were better, and I would get paid."
Ron Swanson,"If I wanted to bring a large number of deviled eggs, but I didn't want to share them with anyone else, can you guarantee fridge space?"
Ron Swanson,"Also I'd have the chance to work with leather both before and after it was on the cow, which had always been a dream of mine."
Ron Swanson,"I didn't want to give up my sheet metal job, so I tried to do both jobs and finish middle school."
Ron Swanson,I now officially insist that you take a sabbatical.
Ron Swanson,"""Find your castle."""
Ron Swanson,"Fine, I suppose I could use some help."
Ron Swanson,"The point is, I was so tired, I tried to puncture an eight-gauge aluminum foil with a leather awl."
Ron Swanson,What the [bleep] is a German muffin?
Ron Swanson,"How big a buttload, son?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, the correct answer is ""Give it all back to the taxpayers."""
Ron Swanson,What do you think is the best use of our yearly budget?
Ron Swanson,I learned a lesson.
Ron Swanson,Tom Haverfords don't grow on trees.
Ron Swanson,Never halfass two things.
Ron Swanson,11
Ron Swanson,Wholeass one thing.
Ron Swanson,How many courses will there be?
Ron Swanson,I made some coffee.
Ron Swanson,I think we'll be okay.
Ron Swanson,Jerry's work is often adequate.
Ron Swanson,You're the only reason we all still have jobs.
Ron Swanson,You've done more for this group of people than anyone else.
Ron Swanson,"Frankly, it's a miracle we ever worked together without killing each other."
Ron Swanson,It seems you and I have fundamentally different philosophies.
Ron Swanson,I couldn't care less about the commendation.
Ron Swanson,"But Indianapolis is home to Charles Mulligan's Steakhouse, the best damn steakhouse in the damn state."
Ron Swanson,I have taken a picture of every steak I've ever eaten there.
Ron Swanson,Let's go for a walk.
Ron Swanson,Is this all the eggs we have?
Ron Swanson,You're not a one-hit wonder.
Ron Swanson,June 2004.
Ron Swanson,Eggs.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, what are you doing?"
Ron Swanson,"Porterhouse, medium rare, Bearnaise sauce."
Ron Swanson,"And actually cats, roughly twelve cats."
Ron Swanson,"No, my room is filled with cat hair and cat smell."
Ron Swanson,January 2000.
Ron Swanson,Hey.
Ron Swanson,"Where I come from, a man's word is sacred."
Ron Swanson,"You know what, I just had an idea for a new project."
Ron Swanson,So if you want to win that seat
Ron Swanson,Then commit yourself 100%.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, fine."
Ron Swanson,"No, no."
Ron Swanson,I'm not gonna find another you.
Ron Swanson,"I guess you're right, Tom."
Ron Swanson,"You know, sometimes you eat chicken and you get food poisoning and then, even the sight of chicken makes you sick?"
Ron Swanson,Take the job and leave me alone.
Ron Swanson,I also walked you down the aisle at your wedding.
Ron Swanson,I was your boss.
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,What do you believe should be the ultimate goal of this department?
Ron Swanson,"I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief."
Ron Swanson,Make sure you keep a firm pressure on the cranium.
Ron Swanson,Take it.
Ron Swanson,It's your job.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is ridiculous."
Ron Swanson,Listen up!
Ron Swanson,Why do I only date brunettes?
Ron Swanson,Leslie wanted to hire a contractor to build a stage.
Ron Swanson,I have to turn off the power for one minute.
Ron Swanson,I'll fire up the van.
Ron Swanson,Mm.
Ron Swanson,"They call this one ""The Enforcer."""
Ron Swanson,You were perfect.
Ron Swanson,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
Ron Swanson,Take a sabbatical.
Ron Swanson,February '96.
Ron Swanson,Deal.
Ron Swanson,"The steak, rib eye."
Ron Swanson,10
Ron Swanson,"The whiskey, Lagavulin 16."
Ron Swanson,"The lady next to me, a bitch."
Ron Swanson,"Specifically, my ex-wife, Tammy."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, this is the first time I ever went there."
Ron Swanson,"Competent enough to keep the bosses off my back, but selfish enough to slow down all the work."
Ron Swanson,What is the first move in any fight?
Ron Swanson,This is ridiculous!
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Miss Knope."
Ron Swanson,Ten hours.
Ron Swanson,You'll win.
Ron Swanson,"If there were more food and fewer people, this would be a perfect party."
Ron Swanson,Tammy One is my blonde chicken.
Ron Swanson,"If someone is interested in buying you out, it means you're doing something right."
Ron Swanson,"I say you continue to grow, accumulate power, find this investor, and buy his business to teach him a lesson."
Ron Swanson,How long have you been running power to this tent?
Ron Swanson,Now I'm gonna have to find a replacement for you.
Ron Swanson,Maybe you really do hate Andy.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Ron Swanson,"Fine, I'll clean up the shotgun shells, but the carcasses remain to fertilize my berry patch."
Ron Swanson,"I have to confess, I'm very honored by this nomination."
Ron Swanson,It's been a real whirlwind.
Ron Swanson,"I submitted it to the Indiana Fine Woodworking Association, who felt it merited consideration for an award."
Ron Swanson,"When I was finished, I thought it was a good chair."
Ron Swanson,"Recently, I made a chair."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,It's going very poorly.
Ron Swanson,How did you hear about that?
Ron Swanson,Okay?
Ron Swanson,This is ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,Perhaps you should let him do things his way.
Ron Swanson,"Like, you're crashing and burning."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Tom's project."
Ron Swanson,"Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint."
Ron Swanson,But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your coworkers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Ron Swanson,That was always the plan.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
Ron Swanson,"I hate all of this, which probably means it's good for your business."
Ron Swanson,You're right about that.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,They're deeply negative.
Ron Swanson,This might be the first time I've ever wanted to attend an event.
Ron Swanson,Uh.
Ron Swanson,What do I know?
Ron Swanson,Is that necessary?
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead and put that order in now, please, and thank you."
Ron Swanson,I am gonna have that third steak after all.
Ron Swanson,Get out.
Ron Swanson,"You're not taking ""no"" for an answer, are you?"
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Things are going very well with us.
Ron Swanson,It is not going well at all.
Ron Swanson,Just take the damn thing.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,"David Meyers, the Jewish guy who works at City Hall, once told me something."
Ron Swanson,"Come on up here, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,I'm bringing Diane.
Ron Swanson,"So, I would like to present this year's Dottie English Whatever Award to the person who actually deserves it, Leslie Knope."
Ron Swanson,"Every award, from the smallest trophy to the Nobel Prize, is nothing more than... Is nothing more than a great way to honor someone."
Ron Swanson,That's correct.
Ron Swanson,Kendra?
Ron Swanson,Why are you going?
Ron Swanson,I don't want it.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I think this could be really really good."
Ron Swanson,"You need to put a happy face on this, give me a few positive talking points, and whatever you do, avoid a vote."
Ron Swanson,What were we talking about?
Ron Swanson,"Nope, she'll be here."
Ron Swanson,Not 100% sure.
Ron Swanson,I left the Parks Department two years ago.
Ron Swanson,"I already checked Leslie, the transom is painted shut."
Ron Swanson,"I've never known what bangs are, and I don't intend to learn!"
Ron Swanson,The time has come to sell my cabin.
Ron Swanson,"All due respect Ms. Clack, stick a German muffin in it."
Ron Swanson,But I haven't had much luck finding a buyer.
Ron Swanson,You have your same hair.
Ron Swanson,"Now I work in the private sector, running my own building and development company."
Ron Swanson,So running for office.
Ron Swanson,How about just you?
Ron Swanson,"You've been thinking about work nonstop for years, it's time to rest."
Ron Swanson,"This is my idea. You're gonna shut your brain down and go to sleep, and I'm gonna stay out here and guard the door so you can't leave."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Right through here.
Ron Swanson,Come with me.
Ron Swanson,I do not think you should run again.
Ron Swanson,I have a lot of other people to meet with.
Ron Swanson,Would you consider coming back?
Ron Swanson,I'll be in touch.
Ron Swanson,Recycling?
Ron Swanson,"Nice form, son."
Ron Swanson,It's called Very Good Building and Development Company.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, everybody."
Ron Swanson,You are an hour and a half late for work.
Ron Swanson,Just a second.
Ron Swanson,I don't like dentists.
Ron Swanson,Continue.
Ron Swanson,I'm fine.
Ron Swanson,Just a little tooth pain.
Ron Swanson,And that was two years ago.
Ron Swanson,Put my boys back in.
Ron Swanson,Excuse us.
Ron Swanson,You live 3 miles from here.
Ron Swanson,This is nothing like Morningstar.
Ron Swanson,"Even if we had the dough, that bunco artist would just demand more, trust me."
Ron Swanson,The land has good sky.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"The fella who runs the hot stew stand in Lafayette Park is retiring, so Pawnee's new business liaison-- Tom-- went out and got the Indiana Brothers juice company to rent it out as a lemonade stand."
Ron Swanson,"Now, you're openly cheering for the other team?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, come on."
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,I wanted to convey the quality of our work without seeming flashy.
Ron Swanson,I'll see you boys later.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing here?
Ron Swanson,Get dressed.
Ron Swanson,"There's time, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you need to take a sabbatical."
Ron Swanson,"I have a woodshop, and I'm planning a little expansion."
Ron Swanson,Swansons! Are you prepared for whatever lies ahead?
Ron Swanson,"Before we proceed, do any of have any dietary restrictions? Correct, you do not."
Ron Swanson,First outing is right now.
Ron Swanson,I will be teaching you to dig a proper trench.
Ron Swanson,Does that sound like something you want to do?
Ron Swanson,"Several months ago, I was on a walk and found my crib tree."
Ron Swanson,"I approached the tree, murdered it, left it to cure in my woodshop, and have begun working it into a crib for my upcoming child."
Ron Swanson,"I value a good education, so I don't want to see Andy waste his time in college."
Ron Swanson,This will be no fun at all.
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna take a college course, Andrew, you should explore a new subject."
Ron Swanson,Mark Brendanawicz!
Ron Swanson,My crib will be safe because I'm building it with my own two hands.
Ron Swanson,Lending?
Ron Swanson,Makes it sound like I had a choice in the matter.
Ron Swanson,"Counteroffer you take me nowhere, and I talk to no one."
Ron Swanson,I never should've agreed to this or let you know that I have a cabin or gotten to know any of you.
Ron Swanson,Right this way is the exit.
Ron Swanson,April's going to take over some of Leslie's responsibilities.
Ron Swanson,Broaden your horizons.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I am sorry that I attended a public event."
Ron Swanson,"Of all my coworkers, he is one of a small number whom I do not actively root against."
Ron Swanson,"No, you don't, there's an old lollipop that's been stuck to the back since Tuesday."
Ron Swanson,Things are falling through the cracks.
Ron Swanson,Ad?
Ron Swanson,She moved in with me.
Ron Swanson,Attention.
Ron Swanson,"April, stop doing that."
Ron Swanson,More important and more important than anything in this godforsaken world is finding me an assistant.
Ron Swanson,That's not really necessary.
Ron Swanson,"Need my buddy, Mark the city planner, to sign off on the plans."
Ron Swanson,"No, the state auditors."
Ron Swanson,"Ugh, there I go getting all sappy."
Ron Swanson,I want meat!
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I've always been able to have one, but I've turned it down because it's a waste of money."
Ron Swanson,"In the eight years I've had this job, I've saved the taxpayers of this city more than 150 grand."
Ron Swanson,"Gentlemen, welcome to the Steak House of St. Elmo."
Ron Swanson,"But now, I need the taxpayers' money to save me from the taxpayers."
Ron Swanson,Post this at your college.
Ron Swanson,"Please be careful with it, it's my only copy."
Ron Swanson,I'm pretty sure you've worn that sweater four days in a row.
Ron Swanson,I accidentally told them what you were doing in an attempt to save some government jobs.
Ron Swanson,It's been a very strange day for me.
Ron Swanson,Tonight we eat something's flesh!
Ron Swanson,"You do it every week, and you forgot."
Ron Swanson,This is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Good girl.
Ron Swanson,"Believe me, I want this government cut to the bone. But I can't have you getting yourself fired, because then I'll have to acutally do stuff."
Ron Swanson,Go apologize.
Ron Swanson,Let go!
Ron Swanson,Let go!
Ron Swanson,Thank you very much.
Ron Swanson,"I came here to fix a pothole, not be mocked."
Ron Swanson,Thank you for the lemonade.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,You are here because you gave us money.
Ron Swanson,The state auditor who holds your very fate in his hands like a tiny bird.
Ron Swanson,This is unsafe.
Ron Swanson,Is the nurse upset?
Ron Swanson,What's happening now?
Ron Swanson,Now we will give you ribs.
Ron Swanson,You're just still upset about Morningstar.
Ron Swanson,My company has stimulated Pawnee's economy.
Ron Swanson,Also you will watch the debate.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Lucy."
Ron Swanson,Whoa!
Ron Swanson,"Tammy One forbade me from any kind of celebration, and Tammy Two thwarted me by calling in a bomb threat to the steakhouse."
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Ron Swanson,"When you do get your phone back, you will not stare at it when you're talking with another human being."
Ron Swanson,I stole nothing!
Ron Swanson,Leslie!
Ron Swanson,Anybody want to go to JJ's for some after dinner omelets?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,I understand your complaint.
Ron Swanson,I have to go now.
Ron Swanson,Please.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Shouldn't you take this up with Animal Control?
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Tom."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,Did you enjoy your second loud conversation with Ben?
Ron Swanson,"that's a very specific dream, son."
Ron Swanson,This is an excellent rectangle!
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, my friends know that I have a strict no call policy."
Ron Swanson,Now get out there and find me an assistant.
Ron Swanson,The songs just play one right after the other!
Ron Swanson,Gergich.
Ron Swanson,Tom put all my records into this rectangle!
Ron Swanson,"You've fallen into a classic trap, Christopher trying to fix a woman's problems instead of just listening to what they are!"
Ron Swanson,Knope! My office.
Ron Swanson,Have a good night last night?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, sounds good."
Ron Swanson,The asphalt will bear weight in an hour.
Ron Swanson,You forgot to file the weekly Parks Maintenance report.
Ron Swanson,That was last week.
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,We've been over this.
Ron Swanson,"If you're worried about swine flu, use hand sanitizer--"
Ron Swanson,The turtle flu?
Ron Swanson,Turtle flu.
Ron Swanson,I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.
Ron Swanson,Not sure.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Whoever wants to talk, go ahead, and we'll be out of here in a tight 15."
Ron Swanson,They're coming!
Ron Swanson,"Andy, come help me tamp this down."
Ron Swanson,I am not.
Ron Swanson,Madness indeed.
Ron Swanson,Holy Moses.
Ron Swanson,Seems like you have things under control.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Then call the Venezuelans and apologize.
Ron Swanson,Why would that matter?
Ron Swanson,Shut up.
Ron Swanson,That's okay.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,You don't need to know my last name.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Sanitation didn't empty this dumpster."
Ron Swanson,To the raccoons' delight.
Ron Swanson,"Not in this town, sweetheart."
Ron Swanson,"In this town, they're 24/ 7."
Ron Swanson,We can't have raccoons for the Christmas thing.
Ron Swanson,They'll hunt the kids for sport.
Ron Swanson,"Fess up, guys."
Ron Swanson,Who dropped the ball?
Ron Swanson,Anything more than that would be excessive.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, my name is Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, good, because I have to run a public forum, supervise the maintenance crews, and teach crafts at the senior center."
Ron Swanson,Simultaneously.
Ron Swanson,Twice.
Ron Swanson,"A pleasure to see you again, Mr. Luck."
Ron Swanson,Who's the lucky lady? Maybe she's an upbeat gal who's nuts about fitness.
Ron Swanson,We met briefly last year at our friend's bachelor party.
Ron Swanson,I also shook his hand.
Ron Swanson,It is so nice having her around.
Ron Swanson,"I normally don't answer that question, but since I respect your talent, I will tell you I am fine."
Ron Swanson,"When she explains it, it makes total sense."
Ron Swanson,Too bad.
Ron Swanson,You're a month behind on everything.
Ron Swanson,Would you please come help me tamp this down?
Ron Swanson,They're coming!
Ron Swanson,"And second, if you ever need to discuss your problems with someone find Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"I would have preferred a regular hamburger for eating, but this is very nice."
Ron Swanson,A bronzed hamburger.
Ron Swanson,Look a man in the eye when you speak with him.
Ron Swanson,"Perfect, Chris."
Ron Swanson,Just perfect.
Ron Swanson,That's me.
Ron Swanson,See ya Monday.
Ron Swanson,"I've been getting a lot of visitors recently, thanks to a stupid and worthless new push to make government officials more accessible to the public."
Ron Swanson,We've talked about this.
Ron Swanson,This is my hell.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing here?
Ron Swanson,But campaigning is a fulltime job.
Ron Swanson,I like her.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna be very candid with you all.
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,Right now you're working and 50 hours a week on the campaign.
Ron Swanson,You'd be surprised.
Ron Swanson,I'd like four more glasses of Lagavulin in liquid form.
Ron Swanson,"It's the lord's work you're doing, John."
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,It's a job that requires two men.
Ron Swanson,She lives for that crap.
Ron Swanson,Get to work.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Then I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.
Ron Swanson,Like what?
Ron Swanson,Do you see the problem here?
Ron Swanson,They're coming.
Ron Swanson,"Yesterday, she converted my bank account into a joint bank account with her."
Ron Swanson,We waited for you.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, everybody."
Ron Swanson,What happened to the steaks that were in there when they closed?
Ron Swanson,You have to take a leave of absence from the department.
Ron Swanson,Count down.
Ron Swanson,There's a bunch of messages waiting for you about a bunch of things I don't understand.
Ron Swanson,"It's time, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Potential problem.
Ron Swanson,"The previous owner of Lot 48, Norquist Properties, is claiming the government screwed them by illegally seizing the land."
Ron Swanson,I should have been here.
Ron Swanson,"Sir, were you sitting in that chair?"
Ron Swanson,"The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone."
Ron Swanson,"Great job, everyone."
Ron Swanson,She's really helping me out.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, thank God!"
Ron Swanson,You bought a machine that replicates an open window?
Ron Swanson,"I'd love a couple larger sizes, take it all the way up to five eighths."
Ron Swanson,Impressive handshake.
Ron Swanson,It did seem like an oversight.
Ron Swanson,"You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice."
Ron Swanson,Who's to say what works?
Ron Swanson,And both marriages ended in divorce And a burning effigy.
Ron Swanson,"Both times, I was a lot older than those two."
Ron Swanson,"By the time I was done, this 100-year-old piece of American-made cast iron was singing like a bird."
Ron Swanson,""" That does sound like me."
Ron Swanson,"Swanson method, where you close your eyes and fall asleep."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I got married twice."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you goofball."
Ron Swanson,And you're too smart to stay my assistant here forever.
Ron Swanson,"And I taught you well, but I don't like watching you wasting your brain."
Ron Swanson,No reason.
Ron Swanson,I begrudgingly admit that the 311 program is a moderate success.
Ron Swanson,"Not replacing Leslie, just picking up some slack."
Ron Swanson,I'm asking you to step up.
Ron Swanson,"Whenever you do move on, it should please you to know that-- God help me-- you've built a well-functioning government agency."
Ron Swanson,This is a weigh station on the road to bigger and better things.
Ron Swanson,We both know you're not gonna be here forever.
Ron Swanson,I know it wasn't the nurse.
Ron Swanson,"Can we hurry this up, please?"
Ron Swanson,Those kids are gonna do what they wanna do.
Ron Swanson,That's all anybody can do.
Ron Swanson,You need to take a sabbatical.
Ron Swanson,Hey.
Ron Swanson,"And it did collect a lot of food crumbs, which is very unsanitary."
Ron Swanson,Tammy pointed out that my face looked better without any hair on it.
Ron Swanson,"I, of course, am Duke Silver, and I would like to dedicate this first song To my duchess."
Ron Swanson,"It might be cold outside, but it's about to get warm all up in my jazz."
Ron Swanson,A mighty fine holiday evening to you all.
Ron Swanson,Please.
Ron Swanson,She's ejected?
Ron Swanson,"I brought you here because I want to show you something that almost no one knows about certainly not Tammy, and not even Leslie Knope."
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
Ron Swanson,"See? You know me pretty well already, but you're about to get to know me even better."
Ron Swanson,"Although, if you'd like to visit Europe, I like you so much, I'd be willing to risk it."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie is a wonderful, loyal friend, who is very important in my life, but I would sooner visit Europe than have something romantic happen between us."
Ron Swanson,"At this very moment, Leslie is throwing herself in front of a freight train named Tammy for me and you."
Ron Swanson,Do not stand too close when you light an exwife effigy.
Ron Swanson,"I'd rather you start a business or use your hands to farm, but right now, the department needs you."
Ron Swanson,The key to burning an exwife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohol from a safe distance.
Ron Swanson,I get to burn another effigy.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God, you're right."
Ron Swanson,"No, on the contrary."
Ron Swanson,"God, no."
Ron Swanson,Two more things.
Ron Swanson,"Protect your eyes, she's a gouger."
Ron Swanson,"And soon, it'll have to."
Ron Swanson,I need her.
Ron Swanson,Where's Diane?
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Evelyn Rowshlind, from the mayor's office."
Ron Swanson,Maybe someone else had a surprise party and actually remembered to invite him.
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, everyone."
Ron Swanson,"I could tell where you were going with that, and it was gonna be beautiful."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,"Well, better luck next time."
Ron Swanson,You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Time.
Ron Swanson,You have ten seconds.
Ron Swanson,Any luck?
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, you are."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, Leslie, what are we doing in Jerry's bathroom?"
Ron Swanson,So you screwed up a little.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Tammy ruins everything.
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,So what do I do? Tammy's waiting for me in my car.
Ron Swanson,"Keep your voice down, woman! Fine, we're friends."
Ron Swanson,This office can indeed function without you.
Ron Swanson,So does BaskinRobbins.
Ron Swanson,Don't deny it.
Ron Swanson,"I will not report you to the judge, but if you slip up again, you will have much more to fear than some feeble government employee in a robe."
Ron Swanson,"But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered."
Ron Swanson,Nice job on the water fountain.
Ron Swanson,"You will read this book from cover to cover, then you will assist me in repairing the damage to my car."
Ron Swanson,We do not.
Ron Swanson,Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees.
Ron Swanson,"I'm still not sure why the citizen decided to come speak with me in person, but I'm just happy to see a government program finally work."
Ron Swanson,It is called Auto Repair Manual: 1982.
Ron Swanson,It's why I hired them.
Ron Swanson,April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met.
Ron Swanson,"You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know."
Ron Swanson,You're my worst nightmare.
Ron Swanson,"You're pro government, you never stop talking, and you have blonde hair."
Ron Swanson,I don't think of you romantically.
Ron Swanson,That's ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't say we're close.
Ron Swanson,Officer Skorggel.
Ron Swanson,What's the surprise it would ruin?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, my first wife, Tammy, tried throwing me a surprise birthday party."
Ron Swanson,"They're independent people who have moved on to better things, just like you did."
Ron Swanson,Can I ask if this entire establishment is a practical joke of some kind?
Ron Swanson,Looking forward to it.
Ron Swanson,I didn't steal them.
Ron Swanson,What's happening?
Ron Swanson,That is all.
Ron Swanson,Right here.
Ron Swanson,They're long enough for five or six.
Ron Swanson,I simply took a skewer for one shrimp and added many shrimp to it.
Ron Swanson,Bacon wrapped shrimp?
Ron Swanson,This is the wrong way to consume alcohol.
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.
Ron Swanson,"Son, there's no wrong way to consume alcohol."
Ron Swanson,You need to take that?
Ron Swanson,"""A,"" I don't recall inviting you in here, and ""B,"" I did not like her."
Ron Swanson,She's not my type.
Ron Swanson,"Excuse me, everyone."
Ron Swanson,Her life is messy.
Ron Swanson,You owe me 20 bucks.
Ron Swanson,"Well, they're still together."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,The rules do not specify whether or not I'm allowed to listen to Willie Nelson on my headphones.
Ron Swanson,I fit seven on this one.
Ron Swanson,They call it a Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Time to go, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,This is my Halloween costume.
Ron Swanson,I'll be in the car.
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, are you aware that your bathroom faucet is leaking?"
Ron Swanson,There's an exposed wire above the bathtub as well.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, that is accurate."
Ron Swanson,Do you have a toolbox?
Ron Swanson,No home is complete without a proper toolbox.
Ron Swanson,Freddy Spaghetti.
Ron Swanson,Here's April and Andy's.
Ron Swanson,A hammer.
Ron Swanson,Half of a pretzel.
Ron Swanson,"If you like the debate, you'll give us more money."
Ron Swanson,Baseball card.
Ron Swanson,"Some cartridge that says ""Sonic"" and ""Hedgehog."""
Ron Swanson,A scissor half.
Ron Swanson,And a flashlight Filled with jellybeans.
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,It's a masterpiece.
Ron Swanson,"What is the meaning of this, nurse?"
Ron Swanson,"Listen, I will not pursue Diane."
Ron Swanson,The human resources department requires that I be available once a month to discuss workplace disputes with my employees.
Ron Swanson,End of story.
Ron Swanson,Really? You hate it here.
Ron Swanson,You're hired.
Ron Swanson,Come on back.
Ron Swanson,"Just take the job, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,Stamp the damn form.
Ron Swanson,I saw you spraying cologne samples at Macy's.
Ron Swanson,I gotta come clean.
Ron Swanson,Stamp the form.
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,Bring me the opposite of him.
Ron Swanson,I fixed her pothole.
Ron Swanson,Attagirl.
Ron Swanson,What is it?
Ron Swanson,"If you're here to complain about the pothole, I guarantee I did it correctly."
Ron Swanson,I'm not big on surprises.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,There we go.
Ron Swanson,Please stamp the form.
Ron Swanson,"Officer, did you see any sign of a passenger?"
Ron Swanson,"When I saw my friends hiding through the window, I drove to a gas station, called the cops and told them people had broken into my home."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,100
Ron Swanson,I want to punch you in the face so bad right now.
Ron Swanson,"Larry, salami!"
Ron Swanson,"Hump day, am I right, buddy?"
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Jer."
Ron Swanson,What do you say?
Ron Swanson,This department just doesn't work without you.
Ron Swanson,I'm begging.
Ron Swanson,Wonderful.
Ron Swanson,First rule no conversation lasts longer than 100 total words.
Ron Swanson,You have used 9.
Ron Swanson,I have used 20.
Ron Swanson,Continue.
Ron Swanson,I'm trying to get Tom back.
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, please Help me."
Ron Swanson,Why do you need to build your own crib?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, we'll go to my woodshop at lunch."
Ron Swanson,Take a seat.
Ron Swanson,"So, Jean-Ralphioâ¦"
Ron Swanson,Why do I want you as my assistant?
Ron Swanson,Is there anything I can do to make you feel okay about coming back?
Ron Swanson,Thank you for coming in.
Ron Swanson,We will talk.
Ron Swanson,Jerry scared all the fish away with his loud personal stories.
Ron Swanson,Got a call from some panicky morning joggers.
Ron Swanson,It's just a fuse.
Ron Swanson,We have nothing to eat.
Ron Swanson,Attention!
Ron Swanson,All I care about is that I'm the same.
Ron Swanson,"I'm proud of you, but also a bit fearful that we're verging on what I call ""feelings territory,"" so let's stare at the fire in silence."
Ron Swanson,This says you retired in 1968.
Ron Swanson,So Courtney.
Ron Swanson,No need.
Ron Swanson,"If I'm the same as I was a year ago, I'm happy."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I am usually not one for speeches."
Ron Swanson,"Normally, I'd be very proud of you for what you did."
Ron Swanson,Leslie's going around asking everybody if they're better off than they were a year ago.
Ron Swanson,This is a rare example where wasting a full day of work is a bad thing.
Ron Swanson,"We may be in for a good, old fashioned shakeup."
Ron Swanson,"So, goodbye."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I gave them to the kids."
Ron Swanson,I will take this.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,We need a bird's eye view.
Ron Swanson,"Why do you need to be constantly distracted, tom?"
Ron Swanson,Tremendous.
Ron Swanson,Ground mission failed.
Ron Swanson,I think so.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, he can't have gone that far. He's got the legs of Tom, the endurance of Jerry, and the diseases of Jerry."
Ron Swanson,Not to me.
Ron Swanson,"All of you, be quiet."
Ron Swanson,Enjoy your half day off.
Ron Swanson,"Enjoy the fact that your royal overlords are a frail, old woman and a tiny baby."
Ron Swanson,I thought you and Tom were working on your presentation.
Ron Swanson,JeanRalphio.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,"My fiancee and I would like to get married right now, right here."
Ron Swanson,Explain it to her later.
Ron Swanson,Accept it.
Ron Swanson,That's the most wonderful piece of paper in the world.
Ron Swanson,They love them.
Ron Swanson,"So, everyone apologize to everyone else."
Ron Swanson,Of course you do.
Ron Swanson,"Technically, I've known her since I was born."
Ron Swanson,Blaming Jerry won't save you.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, you're clearly at fault here."
Ron Swanson,"Well, you will not be hiring anyone because my department is just finishing up a major project."
Ron Swanson,Stop being a child.
Ron Swanson,"There are no sure things in life, son, but you two seem pretty solid to me."
Ron Swanson,"April, he loves you."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, she's mad because you said ""awesome sauce"" instead of ""I love you, too."""
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, we both know you were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of watching Little Sebastian."
Ron Swanson,You abandoned your friend?
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ron Swanson,That sounds good to me.
Ron Swanson,Please excuse us.
Ron Swanson,"Everything okay, Knope?"
Ron Swanson,He's a tourist.
Ron Swanson,"He vacations in people's lives, takes pictures, puts them in his scrapbook, and moves on."
Ron Swanson,All he's interested in are stories.
Ron Swanson,"Try the Sears Tower, friend."
Ron Swanson,"Basically, Leslie, he's selfish."
Ron Swanson,And you're not.
Ron Swanson,And that's why you don't like him.
Ron Swanson,"I believe she's referring to me, son."
Ron Swanson,"You're mistaken, ladies."
Ron Swanson,I see.
Ron Swanson,You call that a tower?
Ron Swanson,We don't have that in America.
Ron Swanson,I warned you about this.
Ron Swanson,Standard birth control methods aren't usually effective against a Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Rethink that move, son."
Ron Swanson,"Look, a clock."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, here's what I'm thinking."
Ron Swanson,"I was gonna wait until our anniversary, take you somewhere romantic, perhaps in a canoe most likely in a canoe."
Ron Swanson,Move along.
Ron Swanson,I believe you were going to do a presentation.
Ron Swanson,Why should I?
Ron Swanson,Do you want to cash in for this?
Ron Swanson,"I've got ribs, and I've got beef cheek."
Ron Swanson,"For the last time, no burgers yet."
Ron Swanson,"""'Tommy edamame' is back on the grid."""
Ron Swanson,"Hello, darling."
Ron Swanson,What a surprise.
Ron Swanson,Appreciate it.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"The advantages to being Leslie's boss is that she does everything herself, and there are never any problems."
Ron Swanson,"If you spend your life chasing them, you'll drive yourself nuts."
Ron Swanson,"I'm just saying that awards are political, and everybody has an agenda."
Ron Swanson,Good choice.
Ron Swanson,"""Tell everyone to light me up with their dijjies, gotta load 'em into my burner."""
Ron Swanson,Tammy One showed up.
Ron Swanson,"Out of the car, now."
Ron Swanson,What does Leslie think about all this?
Ron Swanson,"Hello, darling, what a surprise."
Ron Swanson,I'm being audited by the IRS.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not, playing music is something I like to keep private, along with my family, my conversations, and my whereabouts at all times."
Ron Swanson,That is very funny.
Ron Swanson,"""London at night."""
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,"I actually built a canoe for that purpose, but given the news, and given my significant feelings for you, now seems as good a time as any."
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, great story indeed."
Ron Swanson,So it is a nooner?
Ron Swanson,That's enough small talk.
Ron Swanson,What do you want?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"So, I think the award should go to Miss Knope, here."
Ron Swanson,I don't know if I can take all of the excitement.
Ron Swanson,That's what I called you to talk about.
Ron Swanson,"I'm Woman of the Year, Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,You ruin people's lives.
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Ron Swanson,"Porterhouse, rare, quickly."
Ron Swanson,I'm a practicing none of your [bleep] business.
Ron Swanson,I suppose I ought to go look for him.
Ron Swanson,Jerry's still out there.
Ron Swanson,What religion am I?
Ron Swanson,It took the horse 15 minutes.
Ron Swanson,It took us four hours to solve that maze.
Ron Swanson,"After the power came back on, we went and got him."
Ron Swanson,"We spotted him from the top of the Ferris wheel, at the center of the corn maze."
Ron Swanson,I don't need your help.
Ron Swanson,I can cut a new plinth with a less ironic inscription.
Ron Swanson,Right after I get a bratwurst.
Ron Swanson,Your desk is over there.
Ron Swanson,Taliban robes!
Ron Swanson,"It's very sweet, Leslie, and the national parks service is probably the only branch of government worth a damn, but Diane and I are quite happy raising our family here."
Ron Swanson,She's near.
Ron Swanson,I've had enough fun for one day.
Ron Swanson,Ann.
Ron Swanson,"Mmm, looks to me like you're in the Taliban."
Ron Swanson,I recalibrated the sights on all the rifles in the shooting gallery.
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to start off simple, and demonstrate how to extract oneself from a wrist grab."
Ron Swanson,Enough.
Ron Swanson,What are you eating?
Ron Swanson,Your commission.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna toss these in the dumpster outside.
Ron Swanson,I am sorry.
Ron Swanson,I have been a horse's ass.
Ron Swanson,And that is the end of what I have to say.
Ron Swanson,"I'll be showing you how to escape from a variety of situations, while inflicting maximum damage on your attackers."
Ron Swanson,Welcome to the emergency self-defense class.
Ron Swanson,"Over the last few months, I've remodeled the entire third floor wiring, heating and cooling, restored this red pine back to its original glory."
Ron Swanson,This is the best offer I've heard yet.
Ron Swanson,"Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a booth over there serving something called, ""fried sausage quilts,"" so I'm going to buy the booth."
Ron Swanson,Sold.
Ron Swanson,And I don't wanna see you digging around in there later.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you find it and we'll get right out of your hair.
Ron Swanson,You have your start-up money.
Ron Swanson,I'm in.
Ron Swanson,People who come in here to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel.
Ron Swanson,This sawed-off shotgun belonged to a local bootlegger.
Ron Swanson,Already done.
Ron Swanson,"When she walked past me this morning, I gave her a kind nod."
Ron Swanson,I've created this office as a symbol of how I feel about government.
Ron Swanson,"It's certainly possible, but this one's going to stick."
Ron Swanson,Trick or treat!
Ron Swanson,Another very strong candidate.
Ron Swanson,We'll be in touch.
Ron Swanson,Did you guys get a grant to do this? This is my basketball court.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, that's enough!"
Ron Swanson,"Sounds to me like you're ready to get back in the game, Courtney."
Ron Swanson,I had no idea how much you had in your system.
Ron Swanson,You're asking my permission to take a nooner?
Ron Swanson,"This is a real problem, tom."
Ron Swanson,You are an addict and you need to change.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, well, these girls didn't get a chance to go trick or treating so somewhere in this house there is some candy."
Ron Swanson,Pass.
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,I'll get to work right away.
Ron Swanson,No more talking.
Ron Swanson,"I like doing business with serious people, and when you removed yourself from the company of that moron, you showed me you're a serious person."
Ron Swanson,I don't want to see any double dribble.
Ron Swanson,Bobby Knight!
Ron Swanson,"No need, Tom."
Ron Swanson,"I will play, too, if only to prove that I can find more dirt on you than you can on me."
Ron Swanson,Did you get any sleep?
Ron Swanson,"Are you okay, son?"
Ron Swanson,Zorp is the lizard.
Ron Swanson,So he wrote a second book.
Ron Swanson,Maybe there was a 28 foot tall lizard with a volcano for a mouth who controlled the universe.
Ron Swanson,The sentimental people in this office will probably miss you.
Ron Swanson,Nice.
Ron Swanson,I don't want to see any three second violations.
Ron Swanson,"Congratulations, Knope."
Ron Swanson,The book was a big success.
Ron Swanson,I was told I had until July.
Ron Swanson,Maybe he could write a book to help people organize their offices.
Ron Swanson,"One day, he had an interesting idea."
Ron Swanson,My chairs take time.
Ron Swanson,"I was. Lou Prozotovich, their founder, was an office supply salesman."
Ron Swanson,"Who do you think I am, Thomas Hucker?"
Ron Swanson,"He said he liked ethnic girls, Tom."
Ron Swanson,Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Then Lou had another interesting thought.
Ron Swanson,Are you kidding me?
Ron Swanson,"Andy, April, check the corn maze."
Ron Swanson,"Which means for the next week, I can sit in this lawn chair, and read this book about old boats. Excuse me, I have to get back to work."
Ron Swanson,Today.
Ron Swanson,"Seriously, son, don't hurt her."
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,You're saying a women's organization made a mistake?
Ron Swanson,"I've missed an entire day of work, so at least some good came from this."
Ron Swanson,Are you broken?
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,"Well, it definitely said Ron Swanson in the letter."
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,You wanted to see me?
Ron Swanson,Camp Xena.
Ron Swanson,I'd like to talk about your future.
Ron Swanson,I almost got it.
Ron Swanson,I was pretty close.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you need to understand, we are heading for the most special place on earth."
Ron Swanson,"Look, Leslie, your job, which you're great at, is making me look good."
Ron Swanson,Which you've clearly done well because I'm getting an award.
Ron Swanson,Right?
Ron Swanson,"When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache, and I refuse to clean it because, every now and then, a piece of meat will fall into my mouth."
Ron Swanson,Be proud of yourself.
Ron Swanson,She gets it.
Ron Swanson,You deserve an award.
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna hit the can while he's up.
Ron Swanson,"Sounds great, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,"First of all, income tax is illegal."
Ron Swanson,"Second, Tammy is a psychological mastermind."
Ron Swanson,This is just another way for her to put her hand up my keister and control me like a puppet.
Ron Swanson,"That is, unless you want your old job back."
Ron Swanson,Are you dead?
Ron Swanson,You look like you're in rictus.
Ron Swanson,I'm still trying to find your replacement.
Ron Swanson,I just have one more quick interview.
Ron Swanson,He's on defense.
Ron Swanson,I'd rather be locked up.
Ron Swanson,Everything okay?
Ron Swanson,Why not?
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Ron Swanson,"Son, you just described a calculator."
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,"Good God, woman."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Ron Swanson,"Ethel Beavers, we would like a marriage license, please and thank you."
Ron Swanson,Deal?
Ron Swanson,Screw this.
Ron Swanson,"Not this one, obviously, this one belongs to me, but some other one."
Ron Swanson,"And if the shoe were on the other foot and you won the award, I would've congratulated you."
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's another way to play it."
Ron Swanson,"Because you currently owe me $16,000 for the wood."
Ron Swanson,There's no shame in attacking a criminal's beanbag.
Ron Swanson,Did you hit him in the beanbag?
Ron Swanson,"It's a smart move, son."
Ron Swanson,I need your opinion.
Ron Swanson,On whom?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, time to head back to the office."
Ron Swanson,Which of these objects most represents women for this portrait?
Ron Swanson,You're trespassing.
Ron Swanson,A pot?
Ron Swanson,Isn't it adorable?
Ron Swanson,"She's got a little briefcase, her cell phone."
Ron Swanson,"""I'm going to help my boss win an award."""
Ron Swanson,Fist to the throat?
Ron Swanson,How did you counterattack?
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Passed the buck to Donna.
Ron Swanson,Every socket set I've ever bought only goes up to half inch.
Ron Swanson,Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I've won an award.
Ron Swanson,Or this Deputy Director Barbie?
Ron Swanson,Some other lesser award.
Ron Swanson,I'm paying for it myself.
Ron Swanson,I'm doing my official portrait for the IUD Awards Dinner Program.
Ron Swanson,You did a great job solving that problem today.
Ron Swanson,What's that?
Ron Swanson,The leadership you displayed has gotten me thinking
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,Why did she tell me you did?
Ron Swanson,Please tell me he's meeting us at the restaurant.
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman!"
Ron Swanson,"No, this portrait is not official in any way."
Ron Swanson,Perhaps you're right.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you're still here?"
Ron Swanson,They're too strong for clippers.
Ron Swanson,"Every three weeks, I have to sand down my toenails."
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Ron Swanson,I'd rather sand down my toenails.
Ron Swanson,And teach kids that not only is government good but that there should be a Worldwide super government?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, yes."
Ron Swanson,Just hang on one second.
Ron Swanson,Or we could just--
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Jerry, you get along."
Ron Swanson,"The fourth floor, getting married."
Ron Swanson,"I've offered Tom his job back several times, and each time he's told me he's just too busy being an entrepreneur."
Ron Swanson,"I would wish you the best of luck, but I believe luck is a concept invented by the weak to explain their failures."
Ron Swanson,"Before you continue, please read this."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Jerry, check the field behind the parking lot."
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,"Okay apparently I'm gonna get any work done, how did this happen?"
Ron Swanson,Are you kidding?
Ron Swanson,"As far as I'm concerned, we could go up to the fourth floor right now."
Ron Swanson,We're getting pizza?
Ron Swanson,I have the Dorothy Every Time Smurf Girl Trophy for excellence in female stuff.
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Ron Swanson,"Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys into men, from men into gladiators, and from gladiators into Swansons."
Ron Swanson,"What do you have, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Carl."
Ron Swanson,Hustle back.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,Behold!
Ron Swanson,I want to help.
Ron Swanson,Wait.
Ron Swanson,The Swanson Pyramid of Greatness.
Ron Swanson,She's like a little dog with a chew toy.
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to teach everybody self-defense, so you can defend yourselves."
Ron Swanson,She's insatiable.
Ron Swanson,I haven't seen you tonight.
Ron Swanson,What happened?
Ron Swanson,That magnificent little horse is lost and he's probably scared and it's our fault.
Ron Swanson,Hang on. All of you listen to me.
Ron Swanson,I love powerful women.
Ron Swanson,It sounds about right.
Ron Swanson,I didn't realize you were a part of this.
Ron Swanson,Diane Lewis will you marry me?
Ron Swanson,JeanRalphio.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Leslie, you know I'm not sexist."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,That sounds like an efficient use of the free market.
Ron Swanson,Who else is joining you?
Ron Swanson,"Anything, my love."
Ron Swanson,"Ask me for anything in the world, and I'll give it to you, except a destination wedding."
Ron Swanson,"I like to keep my appointments, son, and I like others to do the same."
Ron Swanson,Looking forward to tomorrow.
Ron Swanson,I've said too much.
Ron Swanson,So I have a certain amount of money.
Ron Swanson,"Ever since I got my first job at the age of nine, I have put all my money into gold, which is currently at an all time high."
Ron Swanson,I'm always looking for new investments.
Ron Swanson,I admire the work ethic.
Ron Swanson,"""Our presentation""?"
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Still mulling.
Ron Swanson,It's a perfectly calibrated recipe for maximum personal achievement.
Ron Swanson,"Back to work, everyone."
Ron Swanson,"No, I haven't gotten down there yet."
Ron Swanson,Property rights.
Ron Swanson,"Fish, for sport only, not for meat."
Ron Swanson,Is that a travel pillow around your neck?
Ron Swanson,Fish meat is practically a vegetable.
Ron Swanson,Haircuts.
Ron Swanson,There are three acceptable haircuts.
Ron Swanson,High and tight.
Ron Swanson,"Well, we can't stand around all day congratulating me on receiving an award from some lousy women's organization."
Ron Swanson,No way.
Ron Swanson,Crew cut.
Ron Swanson,Buzz cut.
Ron Swanson,"Are the scissors broken in your house, son?"
Ron Swanson,"""The stripey thing""?"
Ron Swanson,"I'll give you $10,000 for the vans."
Ron Swanson,This isn't gonna be easy.
Ron Swanson,I've been fasting all day to save room for Mulligan's.
Ron Swanson,The young man has a lot of pride.
Ron Swanson,"Then two days ago, I saw him spraying cologne samples at Macy's."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I've been developing the Swanson Pyramid of Greatness for years.
Ron Swanson,"However, she cares way too much about crap like this, which is why I can't pass up this opportunity to tease her about it."
Ron Swanson,Bully for me!
Ron Swanson,Categories include Capitalism.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I will definitely think about it."
Ron Swanson,I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.
Ron Swanson,I'll match it.
Ron Swanson,They have an impeccable business model.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Like Chuck E. Cheese.
Ron Swanson,My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.
Ron Swanson,"Awards are stupid, which is why I fully intend to decline this nonsense, and recommend it go to Leslie because she works really hard, and I don't."
Ron Swanson,I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
Ron Swanson,I've been quite open about this around the office.
Ron Swanson,"God's way of determining who is smart, and who is poor."
Ron Swanson,Crying.
Ron Swanson,What's going on?
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's about time."
Ron Swanson,Acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon.
Ron Swanson,Rage.
Ron Swanson,When you fell in.
Ron Swanson,Poise.
Ron Swanson,I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.
Ron Swanson,Step up here.
Ron Swanson,Hide the children.
Ron Swanson,Both of them bitches.
Ron Swanson,Deal with your problems yourselves like adults.
Ron Swanson,"Well, this is great."
Ron Swanson,"Son, I love wildlife, but is a store the best place for it?"
Ron Swanson,Well played.
Ron Swanson,"Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha."
Ron Swanson,"Under sex, you wrote ""Yes."""
Ron Swanson,Now Keith.
Ron Swanson,"I'll be in my office, waiting for Tammy one."
Ron Swanson,"I'm heading home, so as not to have to be here anymore."
Ron Swanson,"If any of you need anything at all, too bad."
Ron Swanson,These people won't leave.
Ron Swanson,One guy even looked in the bathroom.
Ron Swanson,"When you get out, you may counterattack."
Ron Swanson,Work on the speech.
Ron Swanson,You could just open the door and let the actual smell of the pines in.
Ron Swanson,There's no need.
Ron Swanson,She'll find me.
Ron Swanson,She has the tracking ability and body odor of a bloodhound.
Ron Swanson,"When it comes to government hearings, the only type of witness I enjoy being is a hostile one."
Ron Swanson,That's why I intend to answer every one of their questions with a question.
Ron Swanson,"My office, first thing tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,Would I have stayed if I knew that?
Ron Swanson,"You're doing what, Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,Done.
Ron Swanson,First order of business.
Ron Swanson,Oops.
Ron Swanson,"Hey, little buddy!"
Ron Swanson,Everything okay?
Ron Swanson,"Now, relax, and let the Duke Silver Trio take you on a little journey to yourself."
Ron Swanson,That took a long time.
Ron Swanson,"As always, it is a thrill to be here, during this witching hour with you lovely ladies."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Dwayne."
Ron Swanson,I promised Leslie I'd hire her a new assistant so the department doesn't completely shut down while she runs for office.
Ron Swanson,"Andy, you are now Leslie's assistant."
Ron Swanson,No!
Ron Swanson,The department is doing fine without Leslie.
Ron Swanson,"Either we complete a government project which is abhorrent to me, or we bring a new person into the department, which repulses me to my core."
Ron Swanson,Reminds me of when my dad made me choose which of my pet calves to slaughter with my own hands for my sixth birthday.
Ron Swanson,"I couldn't choose, so I slaughtered both of them."
Ron Swanson,The point is she needs an assistant.
Ron Swanson,And they were delicious.
Ron Swanson,Start asking around
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,"Now, when your arms are pinned to your sides, use your legs to break free, instead of your neck, which is what Andy is trying to do."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, that's unnecessary."
Ron Swanson,I work hard to make sure my department is as small and ineffective as possible.
Ron Swanson,Would you have?
Ron Swanson,Oh! Do you know Latin?
Ron Swanson,Get out of here.
Ron Swanson,I'm just kidding.
Ron Swanson,Ouch.
Ron Swanson,I'll have your wife tonight.
Ron Swanson,I'm making the water fountain hygiene upgrade our number one priority.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Yay!
Ron Swanson,Couldn't find any takers for Chicago?
Ron Swanson,Got it.
Ron Swanson,"Well, cheer up."
Ron Swanson,I'd like to complete this project by tomorrow.
Ron Swanson,I could not be happier about this.
Ron Swanson,I think the entire government should be privatized.
Ron Swanson,Chuck E. Cheese could run the parks.
Ron Swanson,Everything operated by tokens.
Ron Swanson,"Drop in a token, go on the swing set."
Ron Swanson,"Drop in another token, take a walk."
Ron Swanson,"Drop in a token, look at a duck."
Ron Swanson,Say it.
Ron Swanson,"Just admit that when it comes to digging up dirt, I bested you in this game."
Ron Swanson,"Say, ""I bested you."""
Ron Swanson,What constitutes a promise?
Ron Swanson,"You got a new job, new challenges, all that crap you like."
Ron Swanson,"You will not, no."
Ron Swanson,Are we done?
Ron Swanson,You're a regular Paul Bunyan.
Ron Swanson,Amazing.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,She's got a point.
Ron Swanson,I feel like you're not listening to me.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Ron Swanson,Carry on.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ann Perkins."
Ron Swanson,I have good news for you.
Ron Swanson,Enjoy the rest of your evening.
Ron Swanson,We are close friends.
Ron Swanson,You have ruined a perfectly good barbecue with your demands and chatter.
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,"Your ambition was bound to take you away from the town you love sooner or later, and you can't have everything you want."
Ron Swanson,It's time for you to move up in the world.
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,"You know, with your courage and small frame, you'd make an excellent coal miner."
Ron Swanson,"Of course, I'd prefer you use your talents elsewhere."
Ron Swanson,"I know it's not easy to leave, but this job does seem perfect."
Ron Swanson,Nonsense.
Ron Swanson,I'm not gonna turn you in.
Ron Swanson,Stop.
Ron Swanson,You with me?
Ron Swanson,Your middle name is
Ron Swanson,"That's the way to shoot the ball, Chignoli."
Ron Swanson,"Sorry I squeezed your lights out there, son."
Ron Swanson,"And when she looked in the back of her car, she saw that even though it was her own private property, she would be forced to take it in for a state inspection!"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, look at me."
Ron Swanson,I'm just a kid.
Ron Swanson,Truce?
Ron Swanson,But I avoided going to the doctor.
Ron Swanson,Thanks for loving the Duke.
Ron Swanson,"Granted, it was a hilarious prank, and we all had a good laugh."
Ron Swanson,Not at all.
Ron Swanson,I just can't justify owning four cabins.
Ron Swanson,Two cabins.
Ron Swanson,"The new cabin I bought has a great tire swing for the girls, access to a lake for all the kids to play in."
Ron Swanson,"Plus, it doesn't have these razorsharp perimeter defense planks sticking out of the ground."
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,Make it 5%.
Ron Swanson,I don't want you getting any ideas about us being friends.
Ron Swanson,You can't take it with you people.
Ron Swanson,This is the best Old Fashioned I have ever had.
Ron Swanson,"Recently, I purchased a new cabin big enough for the whole family."
Ron Swanson,Where'd you find this bartender?
Ron Swanson,"It's so far away from civilization, the electric company is not even aware there's a structure there."
Ron Swanson,"You know, when I was 12, my brother shot me in the pinky toe with a nail gun."
Ron Swanson,You should.
Ron Swanson,I can teach you right now--
Ron Swanson,Take it.
Ron Swanson,"What's our plan here, Knope?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,I think I'm gonna turn in.
Ron Swanson,I don't have the material for s'mores.
Ron Swanson,Give me 30 seconds.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, thank you, son."
Ron Swanson,"Tomorrow, we'll go to my cabin in the woods."
Ron Swanson,Leslie Knope.
Ron Swanson,This is the work of a lunatic.
Ron Swanson,It's a flight of stairs that leads to nowhere.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you start work on that right away?
Ron Swanson,I have designed something very important.
Ron Swanson,Here.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,It was a blood bath--
Ron Swanson,You need to detox.
Ron Swanson,"If I tell you, then you won't have learned anything."
Ron Swanson,I believe you've arranged accommodations for these.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,"She was my math teacher in middle school and my babysitter, and she taught driver's ed."
Ron Swanson,Good God.
Ron Swanson,You earned it.
Ron Swanson,What the hell are you doing?
Ron Swanson,She's a hellacious nightmare.
Ron Swanson,These flutes are available for purchase.
Ron Swanson,"No, she's no hero, April."
Ron Swanson,Reminder.
Ron Swanson,You know what I mean.
Ron Swanson,Let's nail these women.
Ron Swanson,Keep this.
Ron Swanson,Are these peppers for consuming?
Ron Swanson,Hot.
Ron Swanson,"Don't do that, Tom!"
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Isn't there a men's gymnasium where you could do that?
Ron Swanson,You all set?
Ron Swanson,And you're Leslie [bleep] Knope.
Ron Swanson,That might be incredibly effective.
Ron Swanson,What say we just stand here in silence and think of ideas for projects?
Ron Swanson,You bet.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna give it a try.
Ron Swanson,I Hello.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Looks like you've got the handle on that torque wrench.
Ron Swanson,There's no way that you're paying him enough.
Ron Swanson,I hate paperwork.
Ron Swanson,"After a few weeks, the toe just kinda fell off."
Ron Swanson,"Sunday school, sex."
Ron Swanson,"I imagine you'll wanna tell everyone about this, but I have worked pretty hard to cultivate a certain authoritative, or intimidating image around the office."
Ron Swanson,"Look, Tom."
Ron Swanson,I have the toes I have.
Ron Swanson,Let's just leave it at that.
Ron Swanson,I'd like that very much.
Ron Swanson,That was nonsense.
Ron Swanson,We can watch the shadows get longer.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"So, come see me, come talk to me, come love with me, and maybe we can walk through fire together."
Ron Swanson,"And look for my new CD next month, ""The Memories of Now."""
Ron Swanson,"If you want more of the Duke, both my albums are for sale here, ""Smooth As Silver"" and ""Hi Ho, Duke""."
Ron Swanson,It's been a real gift making sonic love to you tonight.
Ron Swanson,You wanted to see me.
Ron Swanson,"The point is the doctor said if I had come in right away, they might've saved the toe."
Ron Swanson,You can't run away from your problems.
Ron Swanson,"She did, however, teach me everything I know."
Ron Swanson,Good night.
Ron Swanson,Don't worry.
Ron Swanson,"Now, come on."
Ron Swanson,By the late Lou Prozotovich.
Ron Swanson,I tell you what.
Ron Swanson,Now we're talking.
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Diane."
Ron Swanson,I really am.
Ron Swanson,They're skipping them across the pond.
Ron Swanson,"I've been alone most of my life by choice and kids, this is all new for me."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Tammy."
Ron Swanson,"Evening, gentlemen."
Ron Swanson,You write the speech.
Ron Swanson,But I'd like to become familiar with it if you give me a chance to prove myself.
Ron Swanson,I did bring the girls something.
Ron Swanson,It is a beautiful night for the end of the world.
Ron Swanson,I thought I could teach 'em to saw.
Ron Swanson,Congratulations to all of you for reaching the finish line.
Ron Swanson,The Zorpies are ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,"But, like the founding fathers, I believe in absolute freedom of religion."
Ron Swanson,Also their ceremonies require the playing of flutes.
Ron Swanson,I now realize that seems dangerous.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry is both the ""schlemiel"" and the ""schlimazel"" of our office."
Ron Swanson,Hail Zorp.
Ron Swanson,I happen to make flutes in my wood shop.
Ron Swanson,I didn't.
Ron Swanson,Which guy?
Ron Swanson,"It was a little scandalous, but everyone feared her, so they kept their mouths shut."
Ron Swanson,Leslie needs to butt out.
Ron Swanson,"The whole point of this country is, if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 43, you can."
Ron Swanson,You are free to do so.
Ron Swanson,And some grout cleaner.
Ron Swanson,We first took up together when I was 15.
Ron Swanson,"To me, that's beautiful."
Ron Swanson,Everybody knew everybody else.
Ron Swanson,I grew up in a very small town.
Ron Swanson,You just walked in here and started talking.
Ron Swanson,She helped deliver me.
Ron Swanson,"Just figure out what it is, express an interest in it, and divert his attention."
Ron Swanson,Everybody has something they're passionate about.
Ron Swanson,Breakfast food can serve many purposes.
Ron Swanson,"And if you were particularly amped up about a project, I'd take you to JJ's and distract you with waffles."
Ron Swanson,I once had you put together a brochure about different kinds of Indiana topsoil.
Ron Swanson,Sometimes I'd just give you busy work.
Ron Swanson,"I noticed you needed grout cleaner, so I brought that too."
Ron Swanson,What's his deal?
Ron Swanson,Never heard of him.
Ron Swanson,She was a candy striper at the hospital.
Ron Swanson,Also chocolates.
Ron Swanson,Tammy?
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Knope!"
Ron Swanson,I bought that cabin 18 years go for 2000 dollars. I do not care about the money.
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, what could possibly bring you to a children's performance-- preparing a ritual sacrifice of a newborn?"
Ron Swanson,"Leslie! Even though I didn't invite you, you came here anyway."
Ron Swanson,"I respect that, because you made a choice as a free American."
Ron Swanson,"I call this ""turf and turf."""
Ron Swanson,It's a 16-ounce T-bone and a 24-ounce porterhouse.
Ron Swanson,"Also, whiskey and a cigar."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American.
Ron Swanson,"That cabin served an important purpose for me, as a quiet refuge from the nonsense of modern life."
Ron Swanson,You just breached a Jaeger secret.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,I will smoke the entire thing outside.
Ron Swanson,"Even though it is bad for me, I am going to do it."
Ron Swanson,"Find me someone like that, and I'll happily sell."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, that was a Jaeger secret."
Ron Swanson,What would you use it for?
Ron Swanson,What's your point?
Ron Swanson,"It's freezing outside, so I will not be smoking this cigar."
Ron Swanson,"But rest assured, I could if I wanted to, because this--"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, my mom's name is Tammy."
Ron Swanson,I'd like the next owners to understand and share that purpose.
Ron Swanson,"Obviously, I'm just gonna decline it."
Ron Swanson,I despised them.
Ron Swanson,And then just twist away.
Ron Swanson,Now do you see how silly these things are?
Ron Swanson,"And while you're there, neither doodle nor jump."
Ron Swanson,Well done.
Ron Swanson,Flutes are 80 dollars apiece.
Ron Swanson,I don't hold hands.
Ron Swanson,Go sit in your office while I consider whether to turn you in to the judge.
Ron Swanson,And recorders are 150.
Ron Swanson,I don't want the damn thing.
Ron Swanson,That was Symphony for the Righteous Destruction of Humanity in E minor.
Ron Swanson,"Diane, why don't you take the girls for some ice cream while I dispose of this sewer dwelling gutter witch?"
Ron Swanson,You made a mistake.
Ron Swanson,Camp Athena was her idea.
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,She's the one who really deserves it.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Time to vote.
Ron Swanson,"All those who would like the bloated corpse of the government to keep running the snack bars at taxpayer expense, raise your hands."
Ron Swanson,Very good.
Ron Swanson,Very good.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, everybody."
Ron Swanson,She did all the work.
Ron Swanson,"Well, having you and the kids in my life has made me a different person."
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,How are things at the hospital?
Ron Swanson,Per household.
Ron Swanson,"Morning, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Did you have a good night?
Ron Swanson,About 83 cents.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I have a new idea."
Ron Swanson,I propose that we take all the money we made from the Harvest Festival and return it to the citizens.
Ron Swanson,This is what I did last night.
Ron Swanson,"After I got home, I drank six more glasses of whiskey and then I finished crafting this small harp, using a band saw, a spokeshave and an oscillating spindle sander."
Ron Swanson,You need to purge all of this garbage from your system.
Ron Swanson,Before postage.
Ron Swanson,"But wait, there's more."
Ron Swanson,"You'll notice I'm holding up yesterday's newspaper, so you can tell that I'm not lying."
Ron Swanson,"Talk about all the things you do on those screens, and let the words just float away into the fresh air, and then we will be done."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, sir."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, could you come into my office?"
Ron Swanson,"In this office, we treat each other with respect."
Ron Swanson,You are friends and coworkers.
Ron Swanson,Enough!
Ron Swanson,You're describing a hotel.
Ron Swanson,The open house is now closed.
Ron Swanson,Here are some photographs of me drinking the whiskey.
Ron Swanson,We are not accepting bids at this time.
Ron Swanson,Are we done?
Ron Swanson,"Get off my car, woman!"
Ron Swanson,I knew you couldn't get a wife as hot as her.
Ron Swanson,I knew it.
Ron Swanson,"You look sad, Knope."
Ron Swanson,Ready to go?
Ron Swanson,Set up shop in our office.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, take Leslie's desk."
Ron Swanson,You gotta be kidding me.
Ron Swanson,I'm fine.
Ron Swanson,Her visa was set to expire the day after you got married at the county courthouse in front of three strangers and no family.
Ron Swanson,Why would he want to tear down a perfectly good cabin?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, but Wendy was born in Ottawa, Canada."
Ron Swanson,It's a green card marriage.
Ron Swanson,Swansons have a preternaturally high tolerance for alcohol.
Ron Swanson,My old man used to put Wild Turkey on his Corn Flakes.
Ron Swanson,"I just found out, through some pretty impressive investigating, that your wedding was a sham."
Ron Swanson,Winning the game.
Ron Swanson,Kind of.
Ron Swanson,Do be seated and congratulate me.
Ron Swanson,Attagirl.
Ron Swanson,Tomato sauce.
Ron Swanson,You carry that with you all the time?
Ron Swanson,The sun sets in 95 minutes.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Ron Swanson,"A ""schlemiel"" is the guy who spills soup at a fancy party."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,There's no point.
Ron Swanson,It's a home run for the city.
Ron Swanson,Paul!
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, why must you stick your nose into everyone else's business?"
Ron Swanson,"Why don't you just tell us what our next project is, and I'll go camping by myself."
Ron Swanson,Lesson learned.
Ron Swanson,Stop sidebarring.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Next.
Ron Swanson,"We already paid for those vans, Mr. Butler."
Ron Swanson,$900 for one day.
Ron Swanson,Ten is tennis legend Steffi Graf.
Ron Swanson,"Wendy is a 7.4, which is too high for Tom, who is a 3.8."
Ron Swanson,I've established a scientifically perfect ten point scale of human beauty.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Diane."
Ron Swanson,I have brought you flowers.
Ron Swanson,There's more room in my life for fun.
Ron Swanson,And I like it.
Ron Swanson,Nice.
Ron Swanson,Bully.
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,I care about the people's right to consume whatever they want.
Ron Swanson,We're doing it.
Ron Swanson,It's called the ground when it's outside.
Ron Swanson,"It's like yoga, except I still get to kill something."
Ron Swanson,"A ""schlimazel"" is the guy he spills it on."
Ron Swanson,Fishing relaxes me.
Ron Swanson,I just wanna get the work over as soon as possible so I can do some fishing.
Ron Swanson,Let's get to the brainstorming!
Ron Swanson,Let's hustle.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, everybody."
Ron Swanson,See?
Ron Swanson,That was easy.
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,Just try to escape my attack.
Ron Swanson,Don't worry about that.
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to engage Andy in an attack hold, and he's going to try and break free."
Ron Swanson,Impressive.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure I am not.
Ron Swanson,You betcha.
Ron Swanson,"No, we're not worried about that."
Ron Swanson,Don't pull your punches.
Ron Swanson,We're fine and we sign off.
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,Unbelievable.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,He smoked pot.
Ron Swanson,"""Reconsider your life."""
Ron Swanson,You won't notice us at all.
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,"""Veganism is the sad result of a morally corrupt mind."""
Ron Swanson,She kept her mouth shut and now you're in the clear.
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,Because I believe it.
Ron Swanson,You did good.
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry I lost my temper before.
Ron Swanson,It was 'cause I was shot in the head by a moron.
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Ron Swanson,I work for the government.
Ron Swanson,Andrew That's now how grownups handle tough situations.
Ron Swanson,"We're not leaving, woman."
Ron Swanson,"Apology not accepted, moron."
Ron Swanson,You're a real stand-up guy.
Ron Swanson,Stop trying to get rid of us.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I said no.
Ron Swanson,Let me just call Tammy first and get permission.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Maybe the next time I'm at the doctor's office getting my prostate examined, you could come by and shoot me in the head!"
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,We have everything under control.
Ron Swanson,"If it's that important to your company, I'll do it."
Ron Swanson,I regret everything.
Ron Swanson,"Hang on a minute, Tom, I'm not done berating Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"""Annabel, could I be more jels of your lowlights right now?"""
Ron Swanson,"You didn't get a license? What kind of moron doesn't get a license? That's reckless endangerment, my son."
Ron Swanson,"That's a 25,000 fine dollars, minimum, and probably jail time."
Ron Swanson,"""I mean, O.M.Squee, talk about bangs envy."""
Ron Swanson,Of course I did.
Ron Swanson,I assume he saw my name and address at the bottom of the letter I nailed to his door.
Ron Swanson,"Well, proceed with your work."
Ron Swanson,We face our fears head on.
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Joan Callamezzo wants me to go on Pawnee Today to discuss my chairs with this Porter woman."
Ron Swanson,My son is several weeks old.
Ron Swanson,"Instead, why don't you go into the pet store and feed yourself to the snakes?"
Ron Swanson,I I don't know what happened.
Ron Swanson,That's a good shoeshine.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,From there.
Ron Swanson,"No, get it."
Ron Swanson,We gotta talk ourselves out of this late registration fee for the Parks van.
Ron Swanson,"Get my lunch for me, please."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need you to go up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles on the fourth floor.
Ron Swanson,April?
Ron Swanson,Eat.
Ron Swanson,Sad wall.
Ron Swanson,Move!
Ron Swanson,"They'll only talk to you or me, and I can't go, because I don't want to."
Ron Swanson,Godspeed.
Ron Swanson,This gambit has failed.
Ron Swanson,No!
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,He's quite familiar with the sound of power tools.
Ron Swanson,Please.
Ron Swanson,That'll be all.
Ron Swanson,"Well, okay, so, that was the problem."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, all."
Ron Swanson,A sad desk.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, hey!"
Ron Swanson,"To hell with you woman, goodbye."
Ron Swanson,You know?
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"Sometimes, a sound is just a sound."
Ron Swanson,"Welcome back, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I emitted a noise.
Ron Swanson,That's terrific.
Ron Swanson,"Thanks, you guys."
Ron Swanson,Let's eat!
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,Frankly.
Ron Swanson,The noise was involuntary.
Ron Swanson,"How about you shoot me in the head? Oh, wait, you already did that."
Ron Swanson,"Perhaps next time I'm enjoying some alone time in the men's restroom, you could invite yourself into my stall and shoot me in the head."
Ron Swanson,Andâ¦ that should do it.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, thank goodness for Michael."
Ron Swanson,"Victory over me, Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,One thing I promised myself when I buried gold in my backyard was that I'd never be a hoarder or a miser about it.
Ron Swanson,The rarest jewel of all.
Ron Swanson,"If I win, hamburgers remain in the commissary."
Ron Swanson,Cookoff later today in the courtyard.
Ron Swanson,"Attention, person who shot me in the head! I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna tear you apart."
Ron Swanson,Challenge accepted.
Ron Swanson,Delicious.
Ron Swanson,"If so, yes."
Ron Swanson,Is that a fried turkey leg inside a grilled hamburger?
Ron Swanson,Has the opposite effect on me.
Ron Swanson,I just wanted to make sure this pointless health crusade won't affect the only part of my job that I like.
Ron Swanson,I've eaten a commissary hamburger for lunch every day for 12 years.
Ron Swanson,Listen.
Ron Swanson,Why would anyone do that to themselves?
Ron Swanson,Got a second?
Ron Swanson,April?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, please."
Ron Swanson,I said it's a hernia.
Ron Swanson,I don't want a leather jacket.
Ron Swanson,Why not?
Ron Swanson,"I, Ron Swanson, any other damn thing you might need."
Ron Swanson,"Diane and I have been seeing a lot of each other, recently."
Ron Swanson,"Are you still on parole, by the way?"
Ron Swanson,"Hello, girls."
Ron Swanson,So we need to find proof of every tax deduction I've taken in the last five years.
Ron Swanson,It means what it means.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"How are the girls Yes, they are."
Ron Swanson,I'm safe.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,It's just a minor medical issue.
Ron Swanson,I have a hernia.
Ron Swanson,Christopher.
Ron Swanson,Bye.
Ron Swanson,Terrific.
Ron Swanson,Which is why the makers of carbonated water will soon know exactly where to find me.
Ron Swanson,"But more importantly, if you believe in something, you sign your name to it."
Ron Swanson,They're basically made of glass.
Ron Swanson,"""Encapsulate the spirit of melancholy."""
Ron Swanson,A vegan is gonna physically attack me?
Ron Swanson,"Just as we suspected, John."
Ron Swanson,What's gonna happen?
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Ron Swanson,What did you think they were gonna say to you?
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Ron Swanson,"You know, Leslie, the Super Bowl is in a couple of months."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, new plan."
Ron Swanson,Start over and speak differently.
Ron Swanson,"Everyone else makes this candy house, and I make myself useful elsewhere."
Ron Swanson,I usually watch it with my brothers.
Ron Swanson,Maybe you could come by at halftime and shoot me in the head.
Ron Swanson,"We repaired the valve stem seal, and now all that remains is to tighten down this packing nut."
Ron Swanson,I need to find someone to fill in for April.
Ron Swanson,"Now, I know I'm not going to find someone who's both aggressively mean and apathetic."
Ron Swanson,"There will be no sex today, Tammy."
Ron Swanson,"So, just sit here and do your thing."
Ron Swanson,"On principle, I never say anything that another person is obviously trying to get me to say."
Ron Swanson,"My first wedding ceremony took two hours, because after the priest said ""Repeat after me"" I fell silent."
Ron Swanson,"Rangers, as a reward for coming on this trip, I have gotten you each two gifts."
Ron Swanson,Go ahead.
Ron Swanson,Open 'em.
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, I was wondering if I could go to lunch with Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,"That is a canvas sheet, the most versatile object known to man."
Ron Swanson,"It can be used to make tents, backpacks, shoes, stretchers, sails, tarpaulins, and I suppose, in the most dire of circumstances, it can be a surface on which to make ""art."""
Ron Swanson,The second gift is the box itself.
Ron Swanson,You have 10 minutes to assemble a shelter using only your two gifts.
Ron Swanson,Go.
Ron Swanson,Superstraw.
Ron Swanson,What's new?
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,But I think I might know someone who will be just as ineffective.
Ron Swanson,April really is the whole package.
Ron Swanson,"To hell with you woman, goodbye."
Ron Swanson,It's a crotch blinder of my own design.
Ron Swanson,I love Food and Stuff.
Ron Swanson,It's where I buy all of my food.
Ron Swanson,That is tonight.
Ron Swanson,"""Be ice cream or be nothing."""
Ron Swanson,You're not mad?
Ron Swanson,"""Dear frozen yogurt, you are the celery of desserts."""
Ron Swanson,"So far I've written to a vegetable farm, several European ambassadors, a manufacturer of male cologne, and a nonfat frozen yogurt bar."
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Tonight is our next monthly community outreach public forum.
Ron Swanson,Leslie will be running it.
Ron Swanson,"Of course, my first act as City Manager will be to propose eliminating the Parks Department."
Ron Swanson,Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
Ron Swanson,Why would you call it that on your menu?
Ron Swanson,Although I expect a spirited debate with Leslie.
Ron Swanson,What is the nature of your work on this floor?
Ron Swanson,"I am composing strongly worded letters about things I disapprove of, and I am using the internet to get addresses where I can send them."
Ron Swanson,"Computers are mostly pointless, but that Yelp thing gave me a great idea on how to criticize people and places."
Ron Swanson,Speaking of bad reviewsâ¦
Ron Swanson,"Wait, wait."
Ron Swanson,Damn it!
Ron Swanson,"""Zero stars."""
Ron Swanson,I feel like I let you down.
Ron Swanson,Damn the man.
Ron Swanson,"Well, hey, your secret's safe with me."
Ron Swanson,I have decided not to attend this year.
Ron Swanson,You cannot make her wear a hair shirt.
Ron Swanson,You cannot make her whip herself.
Ron Swanson,Now this is a good idea.
Ron Swanson,This is not communist China.
Ron Swanson,I'm still incredibly sorry.
Ron Swanson,Who wants in?
Ron Swanson,"No, it's not."
Ron Swanson,What more could you guys possibly want her to do?
Ron Swanson,We've been over this.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I love you, too."
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Ron Swanson,Good luck.
Ron Swanson,You may continue.
Ron Swanson,And we need one more.
Ron Swanson,Well done!
Ron Swanson,"I do like the word ""business."""
Ron Swanson,You two more than deserve each other.
Ron Swanson,Come on.
Ron Swanson,Why did you enter at all?
Ron Swanson,It's in every newspaper.
Ron Swanson,The government is shut down.
Ron Swanson,"Wait Leslie loves romance, but she also loves being right."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Andy."
Ron Swanson,We still never talk sometimes.
Ron Swanson,"Is there something you used to disagree on, but you've since come around to her way of thinking?"
Ron Swanson,And I feel like the emptiness of my stomach is gonna lead to a pretty epic breakfast.
Ron Swanson,Best friend I ever had.
Ron Swanson,"I'm trying to teach my boys about rationing food, and your selfindulgent ethnic food court isn't helping."
Ron Swanson,I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name.
Ron Swanson,"Belay that order, Dana."
Ron Swanson,"Son, this horse has an honorary degree from Notre Dame."
Ron Swanson,I'm not interested in caring about people.
Ron Swanson,That's not my department.
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"Well, if we're lucky, this building will be empty for months."
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Ron Swanson,Mmm!
Ron Swanson,"No one got hurt, but there was an incident."
Ron Swanson,"First of all, everyone is fine."
Ron Swanson,Yes!
Ron Swanson,This isn't a steak.
Ron Swanson,How long will it take?
Ron Swanson,There is no substitute for the real thing.
Ron Swanson,"Fresh air, real weapons, an honest kill."
Ron Swanson,I don't like French words.
Ron Swanson,"Did that woman call my chair ""delicious""?"
Ron Swanson,Deal.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you know that wild goose chase you sent Ben on for Valentine's Day?"
Ron Swanson,Just have your tools and materials brought up here.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sure the government believed you when you told them that, and I tip my cap to you for profiting off their ignorance."
Ron Swanson,"But I'm offering you two months paid vacation and the ability to take credit for my work, which will be flawless."
Ron Swanson,I got all help I'll need right here.
Ron Swanson,I'm worried Chris doesn't have any.
Ron Swanson,"Since I am not a rabbit, no, I do not."
Ron Swanson,She'll get off your jock.
Ron Swanson,Are you still here?
Ron Swanson,That'll make her feel better.
Ron Swanson,Here's what you do.
Ron Swanson,Anything is anything.
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,Sad floor.
Ron Swanson,You don't have funding.
Ron Swanson,Can you sign off on my plans now?
Ron Swanson,Call the cops.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Good talk.
Ron Swanson,I didn't.
Ron Swanson,I did not.
Ron Swanson,Just the crows and the beef.
Ron Swanson,Mmmmmm.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Find one person here who you haven't helped by putting your life on hold.
Ron Swanson,"In this scenario, she will be coming at you pants-less."
Ron Swanson,I don't think so.
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Impossible.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Just wanted to tell you, I understand that city codes exist, and I know why they exist."
Ron Swanson,And most of my stuff.
Ron Swanson,Busy?
Ron Swanson,Problem solved.
Ron Swanson,How much are they?
Ron Swanson,Now neither of you has a tiara.
Ron Swanson,There.
Ron Swanson,It's art.
Ron Swanson,And I understand that you enforce them.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, well, let's just even things out."
Ron Swanson,"But this morning, I made the mistake of sneezing."
Ron Swanson,"And I've been ignoring it, successfully."
Ron Swanson,I've had it for a while.
Ron Swanson,I have a hernia.
Ron Swanson,Good deal.
Ron Swanson,It looked machine made.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso, I'm good, I got this."
Ron Swanson,I think we're gonna be fine.
Ron Swanson,Hey.
Ron Swanson,Remove it or it will begin to smell.
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Ron Swanson,"If you want to do anything more serious, you're gonna have to go through me."
Ron Swanson,"If you want to slap her on the wrist, go ahead."
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Ron Swanson,This seems like none of our business.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying."
Ron Swanson,I want to live in America.
Ron Swanson,I think Tom seems fine.
Ron Swanson,I don't want to.
Ron Swanson,"It's my property, my land, my shop."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you don't have to move to Eagleton."
Ron Swanson,"When I become City Manager, my job is yours."
Ron Swanson,It was too perfect.
Ron Swanson,This is America.
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Ron Swanson,"You know, Leslie just thinks you're a wounded animal, so her female instincts are kicking in."
Ron Swanson,"You want to live in North Korea, you can live in North Korea."
Ron Swanson,"We're done, let's go."
Ron Swanson,"So, after all that, it's really not that bad."
Ron Swanson,You're gonna get a letter in your file.
Ron Swanson,"It says, ""Dear Canada, [bleep] you."""
Ron Swanson,Canada.
Ron Swanson,How much postage does it take to send a letter to Canada?
Ron Swanson,"You've come a long way, son."
Ron Swanson,"And women are brought to him, maybe, when he desires them."
Ron Swanson,"The man is chosen based on some kind of IQ test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon."
Ron Swanson,"My idea of a perfect government is one guy, who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke."
Ron Swanson,I did it because I hate bureaucracy.
Ron Swanson,"No, I didn't do it for Leslie."
Ron Swanson,And hold! What was your mistake? You didn't check the armoire.
Ron Swanson,I'm confident that I'll-- Ouchie.
Ron Swanson,Tammy once camped out in my attic for six days awaiting my arrival.
Ron Swanson,She survived on rats and rainwater.
Ron Swanson,The government knows what it's doing.
Ron Swanson,Let's run it again!
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, please."
Ron Swanson,Don't worry about it.
Ron Swanson,"Act sad, let her pull the thorn out of your paw and wrap a bandage around it."
Ron Swanson,A couple city planners like to drink beer in the courtyard on Tuesday nights.
Ron Swanson,Are you still here?
Ron Swanson,"Now I'm using a jackhammer to remove the larger pieces, then I'll spray down the hole to settle the dust and fill it with cold patch asphalt."
Ron Swanson,For the last three years I have served as troop leader of the Pawnee Rangers.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,This is our handbook.
Ron Swanson,Just a reminder.
Ron Swanson,Tomorrow's a half day.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, Mark and I have to conduct the annual trail survey at Slippery Elm Park."
Ron Swanson,"Nice, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,Did you print this out? I heard the printer going.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, and if you have any questions about the details, feel free to shoot me an email."
Ron Swanson,I'm just making sure no one ever has to eat this.
Ron Swanson,Hunting trip?
Ron Swanson,"We're doing a trail survey, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"Another, please."
Ron Swanson,Explain.
Ron Swanson,Is this not rap?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, please."
Ron Swanson,I wrote the whole thing myself.
Ron Swanson,"Wait, I want to change my answer, I'll go with bolt cutters."
Ron Swanson,And I cracked the bottom of the toilet bowl.
Ron Swanson,"Look, Chris After the bar last night, I engaged in consensual activities with Linda."
Ron Swanson,I did not sleep for one second last night.
Ron Swanson,"Right, my love?"
Ron Swanson,Anything you say will stay between you and me.
Ron Swanson,"Just blurt them right out, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Is a gerbil marrying a rabbit?
Ron Swanson,I suppose you could do that.
Ron Swanson,You've accidentally given me the food that my food eats.
Ron Swanson,You could've just handed me a blank piece of paper.
Ron Swanson,There's been a mistake.
Ron Swanson,"Good God, man, what happened to you?"
Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Ron Swanson,Wildeness weekend is upon us.
Ron Swanson,There will be no video games.
Ron Swanson,There will be no Internet pads.
Ron Swanson,This weekend you have two parents: Me and Mother Nature.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andy."
Ron Swanson,"Now, would everyone please back off and just let me cook in peace?"
Ron Swanson,Sorry.
Ron Swanson,"Socket wrench sounds pretty good, actually."
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
Ron Swanson,Little brick building over on Liondale Road?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,We're fixing a pothole.
Ron Swanson,Monsters do not have souls.
Ron Swanson,These people are soft.
Ron Swanson,They're grill virgins.
Ron Swanson,"Ooh! Come on, come on, come on, come on!"
Ron Swanson,"Doubletime, you said?"
Ron Swanson,I like to not get involved in these matters or any matters of any nature.
Ron Swanson,Come on!
Ron Swanson,He is a monster.
Ron Swanson,"Nice touch, Haverford."
Ron Swanson,Over two phone calls came in unimpeded.
Ron Swanson,You sure?
Ron Swanson,Why? It's none of his business.
Ron Swanson,I would not have pegged you as a user of mouth tobacco.
Ron Swanson,"But by the time this day is over, they'll have been taken by the grill and delicately and tenderly shown the ways of flavorful meat love."
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, get your lunch, some water, and a 40 pound bag of asphalt."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, you know what?"
Ron Swanson,Dealer's choice.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna get 12 eggs and part of a dead animal.
Ron Swanson,My first exwife's name is Tammy.
Ron Swanson,"Look, it's not just a hunting trip, it's a tradition."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Donna, could you please give us a moment?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, Diane, for potholes, you want to speak with Public Works."
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's a work event, so legally I can't stop you from coming."
Ron Swanson,Someone will be there shortly.
Ron Swanson,I understand you've tried them four times.
Ron Swanson,Government is inefficient and should be dissolved.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Please hold while I transfer you.
Ron Swanson,And just like that the one tiny aspect of government I enjoyed was clubbed to death before my eyes.
Ron Swanson,"Just say your piece, son."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, hello again, Diane."
Ron Swanson,Nobody answered?
Ron Swanson,"I'd like to talk to Bill, man to man."
Ron Swanson,I have it too.
Ron Swanson,Jeremy.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, John."
Ron Swanson,"The usual, Marta."
Ron Swanson,Tammy's totally cool.
Ron Swanson,"She knows she has that card left to play, and you best believe she will."
Ron Swanson,"Excuse me, worker, bring me a bucket of beers and four hot dogs."
Ron Swanson,"Please, and thank you."
Ron Swanson,"Ah, [Bleep]."
Ron Swanson,He was pretty far gone.
Ron Swanson,Please do that for me.
Ron Swanson,"Well, all the more reason to wear it."
Ron Swanson,The first step is to cut out all sex.
Ron Swanson,"It might be a couple sizes too big for you, but you can just pad it."
Ron Swanson,"First, this is a chastity belt that I made by hand."
Ron Swanson,"Don't worry, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Let me buy you dinner.
Ron Swanson,Screwed the pooch?
Ron Swanson,I'll skip a few steps and speed things up.
Ron Swanson,"I hope you've made peace with your God, small electronic deer."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Uh, I, I do want that."
Ron Swanson,You understand what I'm saying?
Ron Swanson,It's going well so far but it's too early to tell.
Ron Swanson,I also do not want that.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, thanks to your annoying prying last year, I'm sure you remember my birthday's coming up."
Ron Swanson,I am. I am extremely happy because I don't think we should be wasting taxpayer money.
Ron Swanson,"I'd go home, drink some whiskey."
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,Who did this?
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,I like it.
Ron Swanson,It comforts me.
Ron Swanson,That'll win.
Ron Swanson,"This is the city council chambers, and that's you, next may."
Ron Swanson,There's beer in the cooler.
Ron Swanson,You can get water from that water fountain and use it to water down the beer.
Ron Swanson,"In any case, these people stepped up and helped me out, and that gave me another idea."
Ron Swanson,"I absolutely do not want to solve a series of riddles and clues, each more intricate than the last."
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I haven't been back.
Ron Swanson,I wish him good luck in his business.
Ron Swanson,"And yes, I will absolutely go back to get my shoes shined soon."
Ron Swanson,Tammy does not abide by the Geneva Convention.
Ron Swanson,It was a calzone.
Ron Swanson,"Second, you must protect yourself against chemical warfare."
Ron Swanson,"First, you leave no man behind."
Ron Swanson,"When it comes to Tammy, the code is the same as that of the battlefield."
Ron Swanson,That's all we can fit in here.
Ron Swanson,I will give you this gold bar if you say one unflattering thing about Tammy.
Ron Swanson,"In the time I've worked here, I've taken great pains to see as little of this building as possible."
Ron Swanson,I believe you mean Freddy Spaghetti's sauce.
Ron Swanson,"Turns out, I cannot make a gingerbread house, which would bother me if I were an 8-year-old girl."
Ron Swanson,It's food poisoning.
Ron Swanson,I think I'm a little old.
Ron Swanson,Ask her to bring some garlic salt.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, except for me."
Ron Swanson,"Every 30 days, I buy shotgun shells and cigarettes and send them home to my mom."
Ron Swanson,This is a gold bar.
Ron Swanson,I burned my tongue. Don't even care.
Ron Swanson,"Turns out the third floor is silent, empty, and completely free of government work."
Ron Swanson,I can't think of anything more beautiful to share with my son.
Ron Swanson,Good God.
Ron Swanson,"I don't, frankly, see why this is a topic for discussion."
Ron Swanson,"Uh Andy, you know, the thing the other day?"
Ron Swanson,I am... That... That... Was... I feel--
Ron Swanson,Never mention what again?
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,It was just an odd moment.
Ron Swanson,"Let's just, let's just not talk about it anymore."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,This place is a paradise!
Ron Swanson,"April, where have you been?"
Ron Swanson,Ooh!
Ron Swanson,I made this Tammy deprogramming kit in case I ever fell victim to her again.
Ron Swanson,Now you know.
Ron Swanson,But it occurred.
Ron Swanson,I didn't plan it.
Ron Swanson,If I had a toolbox I could take care of that faulty radiator.
Ron Swanson,I don't remember this.
Ron Swanson,What's the next task?
Ron Swanson,Could one of you please stop by the pet store and pick up some fish food for me?
Ron Swanson,Actually there is something.
Ron Swanson,My initials are private.
Ron Swanson,"Dear God, woman."
Ron Swanson,"I have no problem with strong women, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, easy."
Ron Swanson,"From what I've heard about Duke, he's kind of a private guy."
Ron Swanson,He doesn't want his nosy coworkers discussing his music with him or knowing that he exists.
Ron Swanson,"So, if you happen to see any memorabilia laying around, kindly and discreetly discard it."
Ron Swanson,"However, the Pawnee Rangers were founded because some boys want to go out into nature and learn traditional survival skills without being distracted by girls."
Ron Swanson,Why are you here?
Ron Swanson,Don't call me that.
Ron Swanson,What is Grain 'N Simple?
Ron Swanson,Good girl.
Ron Swanson,Get his number?
Ron Swanson,Who the hell is Forp?
Ron Swanson,Except hope Leslie doesn't lose by one vote.
Ron Swanson,Did you shoot me?
Ron Swanson,Nothing you can do.
Ron Swanson,"What are you doing, Andy?"
Ron Swanson,6
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,You just want Jamm to switch his vote.
Ron Swanson,We already have a stroller.
Ron Swanson,I have a problem.
Ron Swanson,This happens to be the studio where a local saxophone legend named Duke Silver records his albums.
Ron Swanson,I was shot in the head with a shotgun.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I'm just gonna stay angry."
Ron Swanson,I find that relaxes me.
Ron Swanson,Motion sensors.
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,It's not a competition.
Ron Swanson,This is a mess.
Ron Swanson,Crackpot convention.
Ron Swanson,I'm really in a pickle now.
Ron Swanson,The point is
Ron Swanson,"The point of a barbecue is not to do hokey, office joke theater."
Ron Swanson,The rangers won't let us come back next year.
Ron Swanson,"What is this, revenge for Morningstar?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, damn!"
Ron Swanson,"She is a sharp, confident, strong woman."
Ron Swanson,"Well, you better find out who it was."
Ron Swanson,"And then, purchase them a coffin, because I'm gonna rip them apart."
Ron Swanson,"No, I'm not wasting 20 year scotch."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I just gave her the day off.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I'm not making myself throw up.
Ron Swanson,Constantly.
Ron Swanson,I will bite you!
Ron Swanson,No!
Ron Swanson,"If there was something I could do for you, I would."
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,She says I can't go.
Ron Swanson,Let it fly.
Ron Swanson,What is Bloosh?
Ron Swanson,And in all the parks.
Ron Swanson,In the office.
Ron Swanson,My department is pouting because I didn't put on a puppet show based on the funniest email chain of the year.
Ron Swanson,Maybe you should try taking a walk... Out of my office.
Ron Swanson,But I washed them down with plenty of fluids.
Ron Swanson,Eight.
Ron Swanson,"Another, Dana, please and thank you."
Ron Swanson,"What I said was, ""Give me all the bacon and eggs you have."""
Ron Swanson,"Oh, gosh."
Ron Swanson,The polls are closed.
Ron Swanson,"When I look at my palm, I see a lady's mouth French kissing a dog."
Ron Swanson,Is that normal?
Ron Swanson,"I worry what you just heard was, ""Give me a lot of bacon and eggs."""
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you are a panic."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, may I use the restroom?"
Ron Swanson,"We got food poisoning, Tom."
Ron Swanson,How do you not have food poisoning?
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry.
Ron Swanson,There's no other way to say it.
Ron Swanson,Seven.
Ron Swanson,Stop this.
Ron Swanson,They're a bunch of career bureaucrats.
Ron Swanson,"I can handcraft 17 foot canoes out of western red cedar, but I can't glue two damn Graham crackers together!"
Ron Swanson,"Stop, or you lose the money."
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, I can't hear hippies."
Ron Swanson,I am.
Ron Swanson,Somebody shot me in the head!
Ron Swanson,I've been shot!
Ron Swanson,"Hey, you kids need any money?"
Ron Swanson,"Rule number one, do not point the weapon at a person."
Ron Swanson,"That includes your own face, Donna."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,"Now, every year, before we go on our first hunt, we do a toast."
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Ron Swanson,"So, grab a beer."
Ron Swanson,This will be fun.
Ron Swanson,To the hunt.
Ron Swanson,Look at that thing.
Ron Swanson,Please keep your voices down.
Ron Swanson,"The traditional toast is ""To the hunt!"""
Ron Swanson,And it is said by me.
Ron Swanson,"You all set, Mark?"
Ron Swanson,Shh.
Ron Swanson,This is fun.
Ron Swanson,Nature is amazing.
Ron Swanson,I came here for the same reason people go to the zoo.
Ron Swanson,"Ben, extension 7820."
Ron Swanson,How much is a Walkman nowadays? Probably more than $20.
Ron Swanson,Just let her tire herself out.
Ron Swanson,Ass.
Ron Swanson,Mmm The first time is so beautiful.
Ron Swanson,Why would you need to know something like that?
Ron Swanson,Poor little buddy.
Ron Swanson,Never written a thank you note before.
Ron Swanson,Here's $25.
Ron Swanson,Go buy yourself a Walkman.
Ron Swanson,Could be forever.
Ron Swanson,I have voided more than Tom's body weight in the last 12 hours alone.
Ron Swanson,Take--
Ron Swanson,Care-- Careful.
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron [bleep] Swanson.
Ron Swanson,He might have just disappeared off the earth.
Ron Swanson,I was born ready.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, you are right."
Ron Swanson,"I buy my burger ingredients at Food and Stuff, a discount food outlet equidistant from my home and my work."
Ron Swanson,I don't plan to buy anything here.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to my son, John middle name redacted Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,"Exactly like that, in that I wanted it, and then I took it."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, please."
Ron Swanson,I don't care that you're a girl.
Ron Swanson,I just don't like change.
Ron Swanson,Her children are loud.
Ron Swanson,"I like going to the same place with the same people, telling the same stories and seeing who can bag the most turkeys."
Ron Swanson,A hundred bucks says I bag more birds than you.
Ron Swanson,You're on.
Ron Swanson,Let's split up.
Ron Swanson,I do it better alone.
Ron Swanson,"If there's any unclaimed meat or cheese, I would like to claim it."
Ron Swanson,That would be mine.
Ron Swanson,Never felt better.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"John was born some time ago, weighing multiple pounds and several ounces."
Ron Swanson,Give me some warning!
Ron Swanson,What the hell?
Ron Swanson,"Doughnuts, go nuts."
Ron Swanson,Bully.
Ron Swanson,"April, Andrew Good morning to you both."
Ron Swanson,What does she call her?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Much like his father, he is a fan of silence."
Ron Swanson,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Ron Swanson,We do that the first time one of us hits something.
Ron Swanson,"No, no."
Ron Swanson,Do you understand?
Ron Swanson,"Good news, son."
Ron Swanson,You missed it.
Ron Swanson,That's fine.
Ron Swanson,You have just won a Ron Swanson scholarship.
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,I'm just glad you didn't end up inviting more of the motor--
Ron Swanson,Did you forget how to have a conversation?
Ron Swanson,I've been shot!
Ron Swanson,We have one activity planned: Not getting killed.
Ron Swanson,I will do all this work for you in the time allotted.
Ron Swanson,Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.
Ron Swanson,"I never thought I'd say this to you, son, but you may be overthinking this."
Ron Swanson,You could get fired.
Ron Swanson,April might get dismissed.
Ron Swanson,I have no control over my actions.
Ron Swanson,There's no shame in failure if you gave it an honest effort.
Ron Swanson,"We would just end up naked, and I'd give her your lot, and my house, and God knows what else."
Ron Swanson,I didn't sell my chairs to that website because I value my name.
Ron Swanson,The only thing that's important at the end of the day is what's on your gravestone-- Your name.
Ron Swanson,I'd be delighted.
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie is going to love it, I promise."
Ron Swanson,"The disciplinary committee is having a hearing tomorrow, and you're gonna have to testify."
Ron Swanson,We had a wonderful time.
Ron Swanson,Couldn't have been better.
Ron Swanson,Mm.
Ron Swanson,It's like she's crawled up inside of me.
Ron Swanson,Happy?
Ron Swanson,Cosmetics labs?
Ron Swanson,Do you think they got eaten?
Ron Swanson,"For example, sell the zoo animals."
Ron Swanson,June and November.
Ron Swanson,"When your kid screams ""I hate you,"" you don't sink to his level and yell ""I hate you"" back."
Ron Swanson,Twice.
Ron Swanson,How's it going?
Ron Swanson,I shook the man's hand.
Ron Swanson,"Again, I don't see the problem."
Ron Swanson,Tsk.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, for God's sake, you're the adult here."
Ron Swanson,"We're here to serve you, friend."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Just thought you needed some fresh air, even if that air is filled with the foul stench of European socialism."
Ron Swanson,Today is March 31st.
Ron Swanson,"So, then, how many meetings do I have today?"
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"So, where do you want this?"
Ron Swanson,She goes by Tammy.
Ron Swanson,"Indeed, I did."
Ron Swanson,Clear your head.
Ron Swanson,They're like those expiration dates that the government forces companies to put on yogurt and medicine.
Ron Swanson,Those dates are arbitrary.
Ron Swanson,"Good thing I've got a fire extinguisher, which, I can assure you, is totally up to your precious code."
Ron Swanson,Are you gonna tell a man that he can't fart in his own car?
Ron Swanson,It's just not an option.
Ron Swanson,It's the same liberty that gives me the right to fart in my own car.
Ron Swanson,Just give me a sec.
Ron Swanson,"Because of my libertarian beliefs, Leslie does 95% of the work."
Ron Swanson,So you should lay me off.
Ron Swanson,I'd be proud to be a casualty in this righteous war.
Ron Swanson,I strenuously object.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, which only I'm breathing."
Ron Swanson,We don't negotiate with weirdoes.
Ron Swanson,"It says ""Ron."""
Ron Swanson,This is my contribution.
Ron Swanson,Observe.
Ron Swanson,I don't think I can.
Ron Swanson,I'm telling you.
Ron Swanson,I'm just spitballing here.
Ron Swanson,I bet it does you some good.
Ron Swanson,Hooray.
Ron Swanson,Hm.
Ron Swanson,But then you made it worse.
Ron Swanson,I thought I told you not to make this worse.
Ron Swanson,She's 19 years old.
Ron Swanson,Leslie?
Ron Swanson,"Hey, take a walk."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,I'll replace this.
Ron Swanson,I suggest we sample a few more classes.
Ron Swanson,You're not challenging yourself.
Ron Swanson,Of course you are.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Watch yourself.
Ron Swanson,Weird restaurants?
Ron Swanson,"For what it's worth, I think you would make an incredible brunette."
Ron Swanson,There are plenty of other options.
Ron Swanson,Nothing beats hard work and determination.
Ron Swanson,"Boys, I'm trying to teach you something about nature and self reliance."
Ron Swanson,Miss Knope.
Ron Swanson,"And by the way, April thanked you."
Ron Swanson,"You choose a thankless job, you can't be upset when nobody thanks you."
Ron Swanson,I hope the rest of your day is cool beans.
Ron Swanson,So keep your tears in your eyes where they belong.
Ron Swanson,Salt water will warp the wood.
Ron Swanson,She volunteered.
Ron Swanson,"Lagavulin, neat."
Ron Swanson,The most important government work I've ever done-- sanding rat urine stains out of this floor.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing here?
Ron Swanson,Sorry.
Ron Swanson,It is gorgeous.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Brendanawicz, relax."
Ron Swanson,"Handmade at my woodshop, and you are correct."
Ron Swanson,Several times.
Ron Swanson,How's that zero dollar bid coming along?
Ron Swanson,"You know, in my experience with capitalism, people would normally expect money in exchange for their goods and land."
Ron Swanson,She nominated you for this award.
Ron Swanson,I'm not interested in letting someone else sell my work.
Ron Swanson,I can't resist her.
Ron Swanson,She wins.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that was easy."
Ron Swanson,Why don't you take out whatever you wrote about my chairs and put something in about RentaSwag instead?
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,I couldn't care less.
Ron Swanson,"What is wrong with you, woman?"
Ron Swanson,Stop hassling me.
Ron Swanson,Just end it.
Ron Swanson,"This forum, like all public forums, is a waste of time."
Ron Swanson,"Good God, these words."
Ron Swanson,"But given there's only 20 minutes until the end of human existence Also, no."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"When you vote tomorrow, we believe you should vote to rezone the land for commercial use."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Councilman."
Ron Swanson,"No, thank you, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,"April respects you, and so do many others."
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,It's complicated.
Ron Swanson,Finished with a wiping varnish that's a secret Swanson family recipe.
Ron Swanson,"No, the opposite."
Ron Swanson,He weighs eight pounds.
Ron Swanson,"Anyway, I have the girls again today, and they're asking to play with you."
Ron Swanson,You seem more like a Hanson.
Ron Swanson,"If you fire Leslie, you might as well just get rid of the department."
Ron Swanson,I thought your last name was Hanson for some reason.
Ron Swanson,I had to search the directory for quite a while.
Ron Swanson,"I don't know what you did to 'em, but it worked like gangbusters."
Ron Swanson,Here you are.
Ron Swanson,You've got to help me break up with her.
Ron Swanson,It's gonnaâ¦
Ron Swanson,"It took years of intense, focused hatred to get over her, and now I've undone all that great work."
Ron Swanson,"Not around her, I'm not."
Ron Swanson,You have to be the grownup.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, whoa."
Ron Swanson,Halt.
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,I have enjoyed parts of our time together.
Ron Swanson,It's It'II Hang in.
Ron Swanson,"Either way, can you help me?"
Ron Swanson,It's quarter-sawn zebra wood adjoined by floating tenons to the black walnut corner posts.
Ron Swanson,I don't want her to think I'm a wimp.
Ron Swanson,In the room.
Ron Swanson,I've heavily invested in gold which I've buried in several different locations around Pawnee.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,You won't find any bank statements either.
Ron Swanson,Did you not hear me when I said no?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, now you don't wanna get involved?"
Ron Swanson,Lord.
Ron Swanson,Where's the steak?
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"""I let Mark nail me and we're still friends."""
Ron Swanson,"""She's changed, Ron."""
Ron Swanson,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson,"""It's just coffee, Ron."""
Ron Swanson,"I'm out of activities, and they're playing with my land mine."
Ron Swanson,You're okay.
Ron Swanson,It's up to the Swanson Code.
Ron Swanson,Sure it is.
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's significant."
Ron Swanson,"Now, I respect you and your service to this town and your country, but what laws are we breaking exactly?"
Ron Swanson,"Why don't you take as many as you can, and I'll cover the rest."
Ron Swanson,More sex.
Ron Swanson,"Officer, I've been operating heavy machinery since I was eight years old."
Ron Swanson,Science is a miracle.
Ron Swanson,I'll do it.
Ron Swanson,"I can speak in full sentences, and I won't cry."
Ron Swanson,Moreâ¦
Ron Swanson,"Problem is, Leslie, the world's not ending tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,We have discussed a trade.
Ron Swanson,"That is my ideal conversation, aside from no conversation."
Ron Swanson,But that feels unlikely.
Ron Swanson,Not giving.
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,"However, to Leslie Knopeâ¦"
Ron Swanson,Thought that was best.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, um, I gave her the day off, Paul."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'm starving.
Ron Swanson,What in the devil's name is this?
Ron Swanson,Where are they going with the food?
Ron Swanson,I think we can manage.
Ron Swanson,Just give me your schedule and we'll cover for you.
Ron Swanson,"As such, I treat it with care and attention."
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, 10 items, and we'll knock this out."
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"Anywho, back to the old grindstone."
Ron Swanson,This is not government work.
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
Ron Swanson,Which meeting is this?
Ron Swanson,Kill me.
Ron Swanson,"I've made copies of Leslie's daily work schedule, so we'll just split into teams, and each team will take..."
Ron Swanson,Sadness.
Ron Swanson,No need to apologize.
Ron Swanson,The sun's going to rise right over there.
Ron Swanson,Your group is better.
Ron Swanson,"Nobody said ""library."""
Ron Swanson,Tammy's got me taking baby aspirin to lower my risk of heart disease.
Ron Swanson,"It'll be a regular Friday, and you'll be in the exact same position you were in before."
Ron Swanson,I understand completely.
Ron Swanson,This is delicious.
Ron Swanson,That's where I got these gloves.
Ron Swanson,I've been mostly focused on these ribs.
Ron Swanson,"But at the end of the day, what does it matter if the lot becomes a park, or a museum, or a megachurch?"
Ron Swanson,Here's something neat.
Ron Swanson,"Shut your damn mouth, Tansley."
Ron Swanson,"Uh, I dug the loose gravel out of the hole."
Ron Swanson,Guy's got ears like a fruit bat.
Ron Swanson,"This subpar toolbox only had one wrench, so I was lucky it was a three-quarters or I'd have been screwed."
Ron Swanson,You ready?
Ron Swanson,Anyone else want to chime in?
Ron Swanson,That's the one.
Ron Swanson,"Calm down, I haven't signed it yet."
Ron Swanson,"By the way, you're out of Easter ham and Thanksgiving turkey."
Ron Swanson,"Yesterday, I fixed that old steam radiator."
Ron Swanson,Just-- Why don't we just stick to these 93 and see how it goes?
Ron Swanson,Not for these times I'm not.
Ron Swanson,"It's taken me a while to see this, but these kids I don't understand 'em."
Ron Swanson,And they certainly don't understand me.
Ron Swanson,Aye.
Ron Swanson,"No, it is."
Ron Swanson,And it's okay.
Ron Swanson,"Threaded a new valve into the side, removed the handle from the base, unscrewed the packing nut from the stem."
Ron Swanson,People change.
Ron Swanson,It's the way of the world.
Ron Swanson,When did kids get so interested in fun? Ah I'm gonna turn in.
Ron Swanson,"You were right, by the way."
Ron Swanson,Great party.
Ron Swanson,I swear on a grave.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,First day.
Ron Swanson,Their interests change.
Ron Swanson,Add ketchup if you want.
Ron Swanson,She made some really good points about libraries.
Ron Swanson,This interview is over.
Ron Swanson,You look nice today.
Ron Swanson,I'm so little.
Ron Swanson,She has all the power and I have nothing.
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Mark."
Ron Swanson,Okay Um.
Ron Swanson,Ah .
Ron Swanson,"Yes, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,Her hooks are in my brain.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I do."
Ron Swanson,You're punishing yourself more than anybody else is gonna punish you.
Ron Swanson,This is ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,I ate it already.
Ron Swanson,I'm hungry.
Ron Swanson,"Destroy them, gentlemen."
Ron Swanson,"I'm so screwed, Knope."
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"No, I'm not saying that."
Ron Swanson,No one said cover up.
Ron Swanson,"Look, it appeared that no one from the proper channels was gonna fix this, so I decided to do it myself."
Ron Swanson,II didn't expect to see you after the yelling that occurred.
Ron Swanson,You are the first non-me to set foot in this building in 10 years.
Ron Swanson,Enjoy your evening.
Ron Swanson,Apology accepted.
Ron Swanson,Welcome to my haven.
Ron Swanson,"Goodbye, Ann."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Ron Swanson,I'm here to fix it.
Ron Swanson,And now it's gone.
Ron Swanson,That large boy is my colleague.
Ron Swanson,We work at the Parks Department.
Ron Swanson,Please don't make this worse.
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, no."
Ron Swanson,I could smell it in your purse before I even parked my car.
Ron Swanson,And I hate everything.
Ron Swanson,It's not that big a deal.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Tammy's changed.
Ron Swanson,I don't know the first thing about music.
Ron Swanson,These emails aren't gonna send themselves.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, my name is Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,See? You just needed to clear your head.
Ron Swanson,Don't say anything.
Ron Swanson,What's going on?
Ron Swanson,Go to jail?
Ron Swanson,I don't know.
Ron Swanson,"Well, we have a philosophical difference on what constitutes a law."
Ron Swanson,I'm not gonna apologize.
Ron Swanson,Some people like libraries.
Ron Swanson,"It wasn't even a real tiara, for God's sake."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, well, relationship over."
Ron Swanson,I only had one breakfast.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ron Swanson,Feel no sympathy.
Ron Swanson,"To me, this situation is a bloodsoaked, nightmarish hellscape."
Ron Swanson,"Right now, she's singlehandedly putting up some lousy concert for this city's kids."
Ron Swanson,No other department has one to begin with.
Ron Swanson,"The only one I know is Michael, and we're not exactly best friends."
Ron Swanson,Let's not blow this out of proportion.
Ron Swanson,Not exactly sure.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"No, Ben, they are not."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you know what to do."
Ron Swanson,Put it in an email?
Ron Swanson,She's terrific.
Ron Swanson,"Girls, this is Ann."
Ron Swanson,I borrowed some markers from Leslie and some stickers from Leslie and a LiteBrite which I got from Andy.
Ron Swanson,I believe Leslie Knope may have left some kind of scavenger hunt clue here.
Ron Swanson,"The girls are on break, and their sitter had to go out of town for the day, so I'm watching them while Diane works."
Ron Swanson,"Hold on, Chuck."
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,"Just listen to the song one more time, and then make a decision."
Ron Swanson,Talk to Ann.
Ron Swanson,Don't start chasing applause and acclaim.
Ron Swanson,"Turkey can never beat cow, Chris."
Ron Swanson,"You had me at ""Meat Tornado""."
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,"Be mature, direct, and firm."
Ron Swanson,Look her in the eyes and tell her exactly what you need from her.
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure that's how you should go about this.
Ron Swanson,"But for these past three minutes, it's been reduced to a faint growl."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Ron Swanson,Partially.
Ron Swanson,"Normally, the pain howls through my loafers like a banshee on the moors."
Ron Swanson,"No, I have a bunion that's practically its own toe."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Don't want to know.
Ron Swanson,Excuse me?
Ron Swanson,Stop!
Ron Swanson,Child labor laws are ruining this country.
Ron Swanson,I haven't even started yet.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that was great."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, son."
Ron Swanson,But you and Leslie like to hold hands and jump off of cliffs together into the great unknown.
Ron Swanson,I just want you to know that I still don't think city codes--
Ron Swanson,New ring tone.
Ron Swanson,That is a gentleman's agreement.
Ron Swanson,I'm the director of Parks and Recreation.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, you can take a class on the Civil War."
Ron Swanson,Oh! Why do you have so many keys?
Ron Swanson,Don't cut anything without me.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I want to watch them meet their fiery end with my own eyes."
Ron Swanson,You were defecting?
Ron Swanson,I've used the same wooden comb for three decades.
Ron Swanson,Leslie?
Ron Swanson,I still get my milk delivered by horse.
Ron Swanson,What would you do?
Ron Swanson,My condolences to both of you.
Ron Swanson,I'm here to fix that hole.
Ron Swanson,"Also, I keep a sizable supply of ground chuck in my desk."
Ron Swanson,"So, you two are together now."
Ron Swanson,I have one bowl.
Ron Swanson,So sorry.
Ron Swanson,"In two weeks, I was running the floor."
Ron Swanson,Worked at a sheet metal factory.
Ron Swanson,"Ladies, no, no, no, no, no!"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I make two a year, so maybe in six years."
Ron Swanson,I got my first job when I was nine.
Ron Swanson,"I never thought I would say this, but I am so glad you're here."
Ron Swanson,Jerry.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, well, I'm not very good at visiting people in hospitals, so I'm going to go."
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Ron Swanson,He reminds me of me.
Ron Swanson,She's near.
Ron Swanson,What are you talking--
Ron Swanson,Pulling himself up by his bootstraps.
Ron Swanson,I'm impressed with Andy.
Ron Swanson,Business is booming.
Ron Swanson,Looking good.
Ron Swanson,And I'll thank you to keep the ruckus down so my boys can focus on solitude.
Ron Swanson,"Hurry, Jerry!"
Ron Swanson,We'll discuss this no further.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,You can't do that.
Ron Swanson,Get back to your canvas box.
Ron Swanson,"""Back in an hour."""
Ron Swanson,"""I'm shopping."""
Ron Swanson,"""Why lie?"""
Ron Swanson,I'll take him.
Ron Swanson,Those beans were a reward.
Ron Swanson,Your tax dollars at work.
Ron Swanson,That way lies madness.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, he is a handsome fellow."
Ron Swanson,And artists are crooks.
Ron Swanson,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, children are terrible artists."
Ron Swanson,"Zoe, put the scissors down."
Ron Swanson,And they want it to look like this.
Ron Swanson,The girls want an actual dog.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, dog."
Ron Swanson,I have tons more ideas.
Ron Swanson,You need to fix this.
Ron Swanson,Don't worry.
Ron Swanson,I am selling this table.
Ron Swanson,Amen.
Ron Swanson,I made it.
Ron Swanson,I'm afraid things have hit a rough patch with Diane.
Ron Swanson,Slash it.
Ron Swanson,"Uh, now that you're getting divorced, I sort of feel like there may be some potential with me and Wendy."
Ron Swanson,I think I'll just take another full polish.
Ron Swanson,She was not pleased with my babysitting performance and left me a very loud message on my cell phone.
Ron Swanson,My second exwife's name is Tammy.
Ron Swanson,"Would it be okay with you if I was to ask her out, once the fake dust settles?"
Ron Swanson,I'm very excited about this. I made pennants.
Ron Swanson,I am an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget.
Ron Swanson,How did... Never mind.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,"Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me."
Ron Swanson,"So, your arrangement with Wendy, it really was completely platonic?"
Ron Swanson,Slash it.
Ron Swanson,I wholeheartedly agree.
Ron Swanson,Are you feeling okay?
Ron Swanson,"What's on your mind, son?"
Ron Swanson,I thought you were serious.
Ron Swanson,"The less I know about other people's affairs, the happier I am."
Ron Swanson,No quarters required.
Ron Swanson,I have to be.
Ron Swanson,I'm your department head.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna take a leak.
Ron Swanson,Let's make it an even 40.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, darling."
Ron Swanson,Put it by a table and eat a meal.
Ron Swanson,If I just had a little more time.
Ron Swanson,We failed.
Ron Swanson,"If that woman weren't so violently opposed to marriage, I think I would propose to her."
Ron Swanson,Can I cut in line again?
Ron Swanson,"So, how are you feeling, Tom?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, mostly you use it for sitting."
Ron Swanson,Delicious.
Ron Swanson,II have no idea what to do about that.
Ron Swanson,"All of this could have been avoided if we'd followed my plan for a honeymoon: a steak dinner, a glass of Lagavulin whiskey, then vigorous lovemaking for two hours, and we're both asleep by 8:30."
Ron Swanson,"History began on July 4, 1776."
Ron Swanson,And if the Swanson Code happens to overlap with the City Government Code--
Ron Swanson,I love nothing!
Ron Swanson,"Girls, girls, I don't know what you think you heard, but please don't tell your mother what you incorrectly think you heard."
Ron Swanson,"I've had the same haircut since 1978, and I've driven the same car since 1991."
Ron Swanson,"No, I am bringing my workshop up to the Swanson Code."
Ron Swanson,Just saying that gave me a semi.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I've never been one for meeting new people or doing new things or eating new types of food or traveling outside of southern Indiana."
Ron Swanson,"For God's sake, Hanson, will you please focus on the larger problem?"
Ron Swanson,I made that man a dining room table in exchange for 60 feet of copper pipe and a half pig.
Ron Swanson,I did not.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Let somebody turn it into a large gas station or a T.J. Maxx.
Ron Swanson,Then I'd go see my exwives.
Ron Swanson,"It's extremely bad! I love this woman, and I just wanna show her that I'm capable of watching her children without something horrible happening."
Ron Swanson,I hear that.
Ron Swanson,"Right off the bat, we sell City Hall."
Ron Swanson,Andrew.
Ron Swanson,My mom's name is Tamara.
Ron Swanson,What is it?
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,"Actually, it looks like I scuffed this one."
Ron Swanson,Shoot.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, let's go to the next house."
Ron Swanson,What the hell just happened?
Ron Swanson,"Then she hit a phase of morning sickness that knocked her for a loop and decided to stay home, but she insisted I go and take pictures for her."
Ron Swanson,"If the kids ever wanted to come to my place, I'd have to take a whole week off work just to undo the alarms and tripwires."
Ron Swanson,"I was just, I thinkâ¦"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, hey."
Ron Swanson,Hunting.
Ron Swanson,"I agreed, because my love for her trumps my hatred for Europe."
Ron Swanson,Guess trick or treating's over.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, too bad."
Ron Swanson,"Diane suggested we ""tag along to London"" for a honeymoon."
Ron Swanson,Everything before that was a mistake.
Ron Swanson,"I like Diane, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for a whole family."
Ron Swanson,"Stand back, ladies!"
Ron Swanson,Correct.
Ron Swanson,I caught him smoking pot out of it not three feet from where we're standing.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,That guy made a water pipe out of a stuffed raccoon.
Ron Swanson,"Tom cat, pull up a mouth."
Ron Swanson,"You already won your Oscar, DiCaprio."
Ron Swanson,I'm really proud of you.
Ron Swanson,I once saw him smoke pot out of a 20-foot length of garden hose and a milk jug.
Ron Swanson,"I have 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19."
Ron Swanson,Can't you walk faster?
Ron Swanson,His water pipe making skills were most impressive.
Ron Swanson,I got I got lucky.
Ron Swanson,Please speak to each other while I leave.
Ron Swanson,He's a big fan of your... Whatever you call what you do.
Ron Swanson,You might learn something.
Ron Swanson,And I love riddles.
Ron Swanson,Stick with it.
Ron Swanson,How about a steak?
Ron Swanson,"It's my pleasure, son."
Ron Swanson,Leave it in.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,"But I will take a free breakfast buffet any time, any place."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, Miss Porter, this is my very good friend Tom Haverford."
Ron Swanson,"I didn't know what to bring you, so I just got some magazines and lipstick."
Ron Swanson,"Your Steffi Grafs, your Sheryl Swoopeses."
Ron Swanson,We had a good run.
Ron Swanson,"I like a strong, salt of the earth, self-possessed woman at the top of her field."
Ron Swanson,I'm afraid she can't be killed.
Ron Swanson,May they always stay that way.
Ron Swanson,Woman stuff.
Ron Swanson,Does she make scrambled eggs?
Ron Swanson,Take it down a notch.
Ron Swanson,Tammy one.
Ron Swanson,Right in Clarence's ancient junk.
Ron Swanson,Here.
Ron Swanson,You two have a good relationship.
Ron Swanson,"Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping in those two butcher shops first."
Ron Swanson,I have accrued 228 personal days.
Ron Swanson,She works for the library.
Ron Swanson,"Starting right now, I'm using all of them."
Ron Swanson,"By the way, you're doing a bang-up job of looking sad about Wendy."
Ron Swanson,But you know the worst thing about her?
Ron Swanson,Her birth was payback for the sins of man.
Ron Swanson,"Donna, please back up two paces so I can physically destroy this machine."
Ron Swanson,Terrific.
Ron Swanson,I delivered a flawless presentation and secured tomorrow's vote.
Ron Swanson,Even telemarketers avoid her.
Ron Swanson,"Every time she laughs, an angel dies."
Ron Swanson,This buffet is unstoppable.
Ron Swanson,She's a grade A bitch.
Ron Swanson,And the last card is played.
Ron Swanson,Tammy is a mean person.
Ron Swanson,To exes.
Ron Swanson,Just keep walking.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Strippers do nothing for me.
Ron Swanson,And I get the feeling that every one of these women is running a low-grade fever.
Ron Swanson,Smells like a wet mop in here.
Ron Swanson,Seems that way.
Ron Swanson,Here's mine.
Ron Swanson,There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food.
Ron Swanson,Come on.
Ron Swanson,"It's a hamburger, made out of meat, on a bun, with nothing."
Ron Swanson,I haven't had lunch since yesterday.
Ron Swanson,Don't like strip clubs.
Ron Swanson,It's a little flowery.
Ron Swanson,A train ticket?
Ron Swanson,"While I'm gone, you're in charge."
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,That it's not real hunting.
Ron Swanson,"If my chairs were mass produced, they wouldn't be Swanson chairs."
Ron Swanson,"So, I'm going to head over to Callahan's."
Ron Swanson,"Breakfast, Knope?"
Ron Swanson,We have a problem.
Ron Swanson,This is not a negotiation.
Ron Swanson,Unlock the door immediately.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for your kind words about my chairs, Miss Porter."
Ron Swanson,"No, you don't."
Ron Swanson,Let me make you a canoe.
Ron Swanson,"People are idiots, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Come with me.
Ron Swanson,I don't much go for ethnic food.
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't know.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I am starving.
Ron Swanson,"I don't personally know what that's like, but I'm given to understand that means you're going to land on your feet."
Ron Swanson,That's a good point.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,Wait a minute.
Ron Swanson,Swanson chairs are handmade.
Ron Swanson,Do whatever Leslie says.
Ron Swanson,No woman has ever done that for me before.
Ron Swanson,You just put my needs in front of your own.
Ron Swanson,"No, Leslie, it's not okay."
Ron Swanson,"If I'm not down in five minutes, it's only because I'm receiving a pleasure so intense--"
Ron Swanson,I gotta hand it to Michael.
Ron Swanson,"Bacon and eggs, please and thank you."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, beautiful."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I would offer to buy you a drink, but where the hell would that even happen?"
Ron Swanson,Wait.
Ron Swanson,"Normally, no."
Ron Swanson,You think I want to extend my stay on this godforsaken continent?
Ron Swanson,Knope.
Ron Swanson,"No, my other exwife Tammy."
Ron Swanson,Let's get out of here.
Ron Swanson,Or have I?
Ron Swanson,"You see the kind of women that I choose, right? Look, just wait for me downstairs."
Ron's Mom,"This is America, isn't it?"
Ron's Mom,My son Ronnie always had a weakness for those ladies.
Ron's Mom,You were right to come get me.
Ron's Mom,Then I don't have to answer stupid questions while standing on my own property.
Ron's Mom,Let's go.
Ron's Mom,Tammy?
Ron's Mom,Had enough?
Ron's Mom,Yup.
Ron's Mom,"And if I win, I bring him back to the farm for good."
Ron's Mom,"If you win, he's all yours."
Ron's Mom,At the age of five.
Ron's Mom,He's standing next to the first chair he ever built.
Ron's Mom,Ronnie.
Ron's Mom,It's time to settle this.
Roscoe,Come on in.
Roscoe,"That's a serious allegaysh, homie."
Roscoe,We're really glad you're here.
Roscoe,"We should get a brity to come kick it with us smalltime and then just be like, ""Hey, chums."""
Roscoe,No.
Roscoe,Whoa!
Roscoe,"""Let's get tight with Gryzz."""
Roscoe,"We did not believe that we did anything to invade people's privacy, Trodd."
Roscoe,"But then, we checked thousands of emails and texts between our customers and their loved ones, and it seemed like people thought we were wrong."
Roscoe,And I hope that you can see now that there's nothing scary about Gryzzl.
Roscoe,"And, of course, we facescanned you when you came in."
Roscoe,"Hey, guys."
Roscoe,"You guys, I don't know what this is about, but it's 4:13, so you got seven minutes."
Roscoe,"I mean, we just wanna learn everything about everyone, and track them wherever they go, and anticipate what they're about to do."
Roscoe,Are you tripping? We just spent $125 million to build our new campus in the Southern Indiana Foothills.
Roscoe,We are gonna be throwing a free concert with U2 and Beyonce.
Roscoe,"Tickets are already on your phones, seating is gonna be organized by income and sexual history."
Roscoe,"Hey there, homies, I'm Roscoe."
Roscoe,Psyched to give you guys a tour.
Roscoe,Totes.
Roscoe,"I mean, geomaps on all your different Gryzzl devices."
Roscoe,"I mean, we might know you better than you know yourself, Leslie."
Roscoe,"And that, I swear, is the last time that we will be peeking inside your computers."
Roscoe,"But, if you're in a good mood, then we could geonudge you to, like, a sweet coffee shop."
Roscoe,"Later, dudes."
Roscoe,All right.
Roscoe,You could just keep the good times rolling.
Roscoe,Yeah.
Roscoe,"Yeah, we're developing with Starbucks."
Roscoe,It's this new app that we're developing that monitors your mood.
Roscoe,"Okay, this is GryzzlVibe."
Roscoe,It was about 40 different ways.
Roscoe,"Oh, hells yeah, dogman!"
Roscoe,"So, we had this far out brain tornado."
Roscoe,"And frankly, if you don't like our vibe, you don't have to use our shizz."
Roscoe,Check it.
Roscoe,"Our super rad algorithm searches all your texts, calls, banking, medical records, blah, blah, blah, to learn what you really want."
Roscoe,"As soon as we get our new headquarters built, it's gonna be way, way tighter."
Roscoe,I'm sorry this building is so lame.
Roscoe,We are hella chill.
Roscoe,"You know, from snacks, to new books and movies, to when you ladies need to score some new 'pons."
Roscoe,Matty.
Roscoe,TV.
Roscoe,"Well, if the camera senses that you're in a bad mood, then we could geomatch you to, say, the nearest cup of sweet pick me up java."
Roscoe,Gryzzl is an outsider here in Pawnee.
Roscoe,So what are we supposed to do with that?
Roscoe,Let's get loco.
Roscoe,Exactly.
Roscoe,I love it.
Roscoe,All right.
Roscoe,"Now, peep this."
Roscoe,I'm gonna GryzzlPad out of here.
Roscoe,Sweet.
Roscoe,"Later, chillers."
Roscoe,"We gotta go, I'm sorry."
Roscoe,I am Vice President of Cool New Shizz here at Gryzzl.
Roscoe,"But as soon as they get back, I'll get into it."
Roscoe,Feel free in this meeting to break out your vapes and just kick back.
Roscoe,"And truthfully, they're all shrooming super hard at Coachella right now."
Roscoe,"Okay, but why couldn't we just build the campus here, and then keep the land or sell it?"
Roscoe,"Okay, well, I gotta talk to my board, as well as our chief legal counsel and our senior advisory team."
Roscoe,We got a meeting.
Roscoe,"Okay, but we spent hella skrilla on this trill forest."
Roscoe,Leslie Knope has been meeting with people to try to sexy up her presentation.
Roscoe,"So, a local celebrity is going to make everyone feel more at ease with us."
Roscoe,And that's why we called on you home court chillers to frack your brainiums.
Roscoe,Is this paper? Super throwback.
Roscoe,That's true.
Roscoe,"You guys, I am Roscoe."
Roscoe,We wouldn't have to hire Banksy.
Roscoe,Retro.
Rosie DeMarco,"He does this annoying thing where every time he takes a drink of water he goes, ""Ah"""
Rosie DeMarco,So no money.
Rosie DeMarco,"Hey, no touching."
Rosie DeMarco,"Plus the Cold War was happening, and frankly, we all thought we were gonna die."
Rosie DeMarco,Can I help you?
Rosie DeMarco,"Dougie, are you sure you want to go on television?"
Rosie DeMarco,Don't give him any water.
Rosie DeMarco,You look like a leather glove got caught in a lawnmower.
Rosie DeMarco,This is not your birthday.
Rosie DeMarco,Okay.
Rosie DeMarco,I can't do this.
Rosie DeMarco,I used to get out of the shower in front of your brother on purpose.
Rosie DeMarco,"I had no prospects, and Dougie here had an alcohol problem."
Rosie DeMarco,"Leslie, you can keep your money."
Rosie DeMarco,"Well, it was 1963, and we met, and it was great."
Rosie DeMarco,You want to know why we got married?

Roy Hibbert,Pass out shrimp to people at the party?
Roy Hibbert,"'Sup, Jello shot."
Roy Hibbert,I am not paying for that guy.
Roz,I don't know what that was.
Roz,That's all--
Roz,Do you think I could have 30 seconds?
Roz,Thanks.
Roz,That helps.
Roz,"Uh, two of the three kids are showering in their pajamas, and most of Ben's ties are in the toilet."
Roz,"Just like, as a update of where things are at."
Roz,Oh.
Roz,All three of them just bonked into each other and broke everything you own.
Roz,"Yeah, and we are going to have so much fun, we're going to play games, we're going to color, maybe we're going to even sit quietly for 30 seconds."
Run Dunn,Both.
Salvatore,"Now, what do you want me to do with this?"
Salvatore,Next.
Salvatore,What the hell else would you call it?
Salvatore,Are you related to that Marlene Something Knope?
Salvatore,My feet hurt.
Salvatore,Do I know you?
Sasha Dunkirk,I actually agree with him.
Scott Braddock,Mmmhmm.
Scott Braddock,"Yeah, the pig's fine."
Scott Braddock,It implies there was a situation.
Scott Braddock,"Can't say ""unfortunate,"" and you can't say ""situation."""
Scott Braddock,"Can't say ""victim."""
Scott Braddock,It implies guilt.
Scott Braddock,"You can't say ""I'm sorry,"" or ""I apologize."""
Scott Braddock,You can't say any of that.
Scott Braddock,"Mmmmmm, mmmmmm, mmm."
Scott Braddock,"No, no, no, no."
Scott Braddock,Yes.
Scott Braddock,"I mean, right now, he's the most dangerous man in Pawnee."
Scott Braddock,What I do know is that he could sue us at the drop of a hat.
Scott Braddock,I never met him.
Scott Braddock,"Scott Braddock, City Attorney."
Scott Braddock,Hi.
Scott Braddock,It admits liability.
Scott Braddock,No miming.
Scott Braddock,Is there a two?
Scott Braddock,"No, no."
Scott Braddock,"Wait, Leslie."
Scott Braddock,Let's hear him out.
Scott Braddock,All right.
Scott Braddock,What's it gonna take?
Scott Braddock,"Mr. Dwyer, we're very happy that you're dropping the suit."
Scott Braddock,"Well, we can't accomplish that."
Scott Braddock,Yeah.
Scott Braddock,"I mean, eventually, we're gonna fill in the pit."
Scott Braddock,Yeah.
Scott Braddock,Don't look back.
Scott Braddock,"Don't say ""terrible."""
Scott Braddock,"Leslie, no."
Scott Braddock,Wendell Adams.
Scott Braddock,Let's go.
Scott Braddock,We got to go.
Scott Braddock,No.
Scott Braddock,Miss Knope.
Scott Braddock,We're not conceding that point.

Scott Tanner,To do what?
Scott Tanner,"Joining us now for our finale, legendary local band, please welcome Mouse Rat!"
Scott Tanner,The band just does not play anymore.
Scott Tanner,"Listen, it means a lot to me that you guys loved the band."
Scott Tanner,This looks like it's going to be a great concert.
Scott Tanner,"Chop, chop, kick, kick, chop"
Scott Tanner,"Hey, Andy."
Scott Tanner,"What up, Pawnee?"
Scott Tanner,"Why don't you let us play those, bud?"
Scott Tanner,You still drunk from last night?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Magazine.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I got, like, zero sleep last night."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's a little long.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Reporter.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, how's your hole?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Really?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is that accurate Mr. Phlegner?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,City manager.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Ooh!
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's not you.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't have a photographer with me.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you posing?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is Councilwoman Knope ahead of the regular schedule for this route?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I just I'm exhausted.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sorry.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I should write an article about you-- another article about you.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article on the Pope getting married, because that's more likely to happen than this park."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So I shouldn't interpret anything from the fact that there are two people from the city manager's office here?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Cool?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Thanks.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, guys, I'm gonna go ahead and decide what's on and off the record on my own."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Actually, we were having a really great talk."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, how's this for a headline?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you okay?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Chris, it's okay."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You wanna switch?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article on talking monkeys."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,A hundred what?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm starving.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Wow.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You seem a lot more confident than some of the other people I've spoken to.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Can I read you some of these quotes?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""The Sullivan Street pit is always going to be a pit."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't understand.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""Hey, you should write an article on unicorns, because they're more likely to exist than this park."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So--
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""Parks Department Foiled by Pipe Dreams."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I'm actually gonna quote you on all of this, 'cause it's a newspaper article."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,About what?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Cause I don't--
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What's his story?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, no sorry, I meant Ben."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Somehow longer.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Have you been to Bistro d'Amour? It's really romantic.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Great, um, hey, also. He's cute."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, it was just gonna be you and me, my sister, a few people from work, and my ex-boyfriend."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Is he single, do you know?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So when did you start at the Parks Department?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm surprised no one's complained about this.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Michael, do you have any paper I could borrow?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Why would you want a toaster that's lying at the bottom of the pit?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, Andy, tell me about the night you fell into the pit."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,A few times.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You don't have to worry about that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm gonna include a disclaimer describing the nature of our relationship.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, yeah."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So how big is this lot?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, how big is--"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,My editor loves it.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Ben?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, fancy meeting you here."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,How big is the lot?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""This park is never, ever, ever, ever going to happen."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The pit.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Lot 48.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.

Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"This one is just ""No."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Kinda sucks.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I've been here before.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I thought maybe we'd be done in time to grab a drink.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"You know, do you have a pen?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Mark Brendanawicz.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Cool, thanks."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The lot?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I think I'll take my chances.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article about leprechauns."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, Fairway Frank did bite the mayor's dog."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, this could be on the front page."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, thanks as always."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article about the sun falling out of the sky."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, Leslie."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, and I got the veggie option."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Come on, Leslie."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You're welcome.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, well, since we're, you know, romantically involved, I won't print any of it."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Tell me about Ben Wyatt.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I just feel like I could fix him, you know?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,He's kinda cute.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I have to go.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Let's do the interview tomorrow morning at the pit.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,He is?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,To me it is.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"A group of good friends having fun, doing nice things for each other."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, I'm looking for Leslie Knope."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,And then I came back to bed.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"It's cool if I record this, right?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Right.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll have a photographer meet us there.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,See you then.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"That was easy, right?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Can we go in your car?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is it chocolate?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I mean, that's what's important in life, and I want to write about it."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I was happy with that line.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,'Cause I hate driving.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Would you mind if I wrote about it?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, Leslie, you're in charge of the committee."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Then I heard about your crazy rotating bachelor party.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Leslie."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The Douche blew this story wide open.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Ben Wyatt bankrupts a town and then comes to Pawnee to tell us how to spend our money?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, everyone."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm assuming not Mexican.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, I guess I'm free."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Shauna.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Because of the burrito.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What exactly is the nature of your relationship with him?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The committee says they plan to push for a recall vote within two months.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Do you have a comment on that?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, this is an interesting turn of events."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I can't even land the shoeshine guy.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I think I'm better off.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I haven't had a date in a while, but I'm learning a lot about me."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, well, good luck."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, are you colleagues or are you friends?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Leslie?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I like beauty pageants.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Everyone is so happy and perfect.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Wyatt."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So I was chasing this story, but it seems like a dead end."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Why not?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So are you free this weekend?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, I had a great time last night."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, I don't know what you were thinking."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,His poll numbers are actually up since the scandal broke.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,All right.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You done?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, we were the second family, technically."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm gonna stop you right there.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I was gonna go with my boyfriend, but he couldn't come because he decided to stay with his wife."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Were you scared?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, your family must be very proud."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What does your girlfriend think?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Nick Newport Sr. is the former CEO of Sweetums.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The nurse.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, maybe this article will change her mind."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, let's go take some pictures of Fairway Frank."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I just got back from a solo trip to Rome.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll be back tomorrow with the photographer.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, thanks."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sweetums owns The Pawnee Journal.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So what do you think the odds are that this park is actually gonna get made?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"And this is where you meet, generally?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"No, not at all."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,We can do all this on tape.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll take that drink.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, we actually, uh, met."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I don't know, I read a book once that said a woman should never make the first move."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,25
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"You did say it, right?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Does the city consider them a threat to public safety?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,That's a little dirty.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't think the voters care.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, why don't I ask the rest of your team some questions and then we will come back to you later?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Do you have a second right now?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Technically?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"They're iffy, but Dexhart has been elected eight times."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, I don't know if there's a story in these emails."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I might head over to that end of the world party.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I actually think I have everything I need here.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you sure that's the best thing for you right now?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Thanks.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi!
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What's up?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Although, when I was in college I found out that my dad had a second family."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's a tape recorder.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Mark."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sorry I'm late.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Me too.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, you seemed a little weird."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Weird countries?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"It's called Tweeping Up Appearances, and it's about my journey to find happiness by smiling through the pain."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, you're on the golf course, and you see Fairway Frank."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm writing a memoir based on my blog.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, could you just maybe talk normally?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Good one.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So it will.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Um, I like burgers."

Sierra,No.
Stephanie Wyatt,I'll call an ambulance.
Stephanie Wyatt,I don't blame him.
Stephanie Wyatt,You have a binder?
Stephanie Wyatt,"Wow, I didn't think about all that, but I thought it was good."
Stephanie Wyatt,Make me?
Stephanie Wyatt,I loved those movies just as much as he did.
Stephanie Wyatt,A lot of jerks around here didn't think you'd show up.
Stephanie Wyatt,He didn't exactly leave Partridge as the most popular guy in town.
Stephanie Wyatt,"Oh, you do a lot of hugging."
Stephanie Wyatt,"That's, like, five times in an hour."
Stephanie Wyatt,"Benji, I'm really glad you came back for this."
Stephanie Wyatt,I gotta get outta here.
Stephanie Wyatt,"Good luck, Leslie."
Stephanie Wyatt,We have proof.
Stephanie Wyatt,"No, he has kidney stones."
Steve Wyatt,"This is a very thoughtless omission, Leslie, and as far as I'm concerned, if there's no Ulani square, this is not a legitimate unity quilt."
Steve Wyatt,"Sure, I can."
Steve Wyatt,"Hiya, Benny."
Steve Wyatt,"Ulani is my girlfriend, and she's important to me, and I need her here."
Steve Wyatt,We're a Twizzlers family.
Steve Wyatt,"I'm sorry too, Benny."
Steve Wyatt,Julia
Steve Wyatt,See?
Steve Wyatt,"Not any more, since Julia got the boat in the divorce and then sold it to a scrapyard because she's terrible."
Steve Wyatt,I don't like surprises.
Steve Wyatt,Not technically what?
Steve Wyatt,Sorry.
Steve Wyatt,"She's ruining your quilt, just like she ruined our marriage!"
Steve Wyatt,But your mother can't.
Steve Wyatt,It's a disaster is what it is.
Steve Wyatt,"Still firing bullets, son."
Steve Wyatt,"Young Ben is going to have a new baby sister, huh?"
Steve Wyatt,"I didn't mean to steal your spotlight, but the cat's out of the bag."

Stu,I don't know.
Stu,This calls for a toast.
Stu,"I'm looking forward to spending time with my wife, working on some new hobbies."
Stu,I was thinking about getting into bisques.
Stu,That makes a lot of sense.
Stu,What now?
Stu,What do I do?
Stu,Mm.
Stu,I think I've made a terrible mistake.
Stuart,"It's my office, too."
Stuart,Get these balloons out of here.

Tammy 1,"Yes, I do."
Tammy 1,Tammy.
Tammy 1,I'm sure Ron will remember the meeting fondly while he makes toilet wine in a federal prison in Terre Haute.
Tammy 1,Ronald.
Tammy 1,"I'll need access to all your accounts, and your home."
Tammy 1,I knew you the minute you were born.
Tammy 1,I found your underground safe.
Tammy 1,Call it nostalgia.
Tammy 1,Then why is your mustache trembling? I'm here as a friend.
Tammy 1,I stole half your gold.
Tammy 1,"Well You and Ron have a big meeting, huh?"
Tammy 1,Knope.
Tammy 1,"You remember what I do for a living, I trust?"
Tammy 1,Wrong.
Tammy 1,You do.
Tammy 1,"You're being audited, Ronald."
Tammy 1,"But as you're so fond of saying, it's a free country."
Tammy 1,Good luck.
Tammy 1,We'll do a complete overhaul of your finances.
Tammy 1,Of this watered-down baby formula? Not even close.
Tammy 1,You.
Tammy 1,What is your name?
Tammy 1,What Ms.
Tammy 1,"Andy You're going to collect all of this, and you're going to put it in my car."
Tammy 1,Really?
Tammy 1,Ah.
Tammy 1,Now.
Tammy 1,I got what I came for anyway.
Tammy 1,Sit up straight.
Tammy 1,"But in another, truer sense, no, it is not."
Tammy 1,Nanananana.
Tammy 1,He invited me.
Tammy 1,He wants me here.
Tammy 1,Stop fidgeting.
Tammy 1,"Oh, oh."
Tammy 1,He's acquired quite a bit of gold.
Tammy 1,You're not doing your breast any favors.
Tammy 1,That's not how it works.
Tammy 1,And I intend to be there the minute you die.
Tammy 1,You're not getting any younger.
Tammy 1,We're playing a game where everyone says something stupid?
Tammy 1,I don't think it will be necessary for you to speak again while I'm here.
Tammy 1,"I want Ronald back, but I had to learn about his finances, to make sure my future was protected."
Tammy 1,You're going to go to payroll and get copies of Ronald's workplace expense reports.
Tammy 1,I hope you don't go to jail.
Tammy 1,Or perhaps guilt for all the times I tried to smother you in your sleep.
Tammy 1,An old-fashioned prairie drink-off.
Tammy 1,"In a sense, yes."
Tammy 1,She's out.
Tammy 1,I'm thirsty.
Tammy 1,Fine.
Tammy 1,Remember to wash your hands.
Tammy 1,This is a much bigger mess than I imagined.
Tammy 1,Pour it.
Tammy 1,"Good God, Ronald."
Tammy 1,You'll take a week off from work.
Tammy 2,"Oh, and by the way, last night, I faked four out of the seven."
Tammy 2,You're a joke.
Tammy 2,"I was just tasting my new boyfriend, Glenn."
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,A bunch.
Tammy 2,You're not even a man anymore.
Tammy 2,The usual place.
Tammy 2,Well.
Tammy 2,Oh!
Tammy 2,"Well I could do all those things and have, but that bitch is crazy."
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,I didn't see you come in.
Tammy 2,Okay.
Tammy 2,I'm so sorry.
Tammy 2,"So it's okay for you to have a girlfriend, but I'm not supposed to see anybody?"
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God, yes."
Tammy 2,Maybe you're not a blonde bimbo after all.
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,"Come on, everybody! Who wants to get it on? I'm naked."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Tammy 2,"Oh, yes."
Tammy 2,Baby.
Tammy 2,Gun it.
Tammy 2,Wanna dance?
Tammy 2,"Yeah, maybe we do."
Tammy 2,Let me mull it over.
Tammy 2,"Oh, wow."
Tammy 2,"You guys, that's amazing."
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Hi, Ron."
Tammy 2,Look downstairs.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, that's crazy."
Tammy 2,And correct.
Tammy 2,I'm very flattered.
Tammy 2,"Les, there are two kinds of women in this world."
Tammy 2,There are women who work hard and stress out about doing the right thing.
Tammy 2,"No, just trolling for some daddy."
Tammy 2,And then there are women who are cool.
Tammy 2,I'd rather be Cleopatra.
Tammy 2,Haven't you ever messed with a man's head just to see what you could get him to do for you?
Tammy 2,We do it all the time in the Library Department.
Tammy 2,You should come join us sometime.
Tammy 2,Who's this?
Tammy 2,"Hiya, Ron."
Tammy 2,You could either be a Cleopatra or you could be an Eleanor Roosevelt.
Tammy 2,There's a prize inside for you.
Tammy 2,"Oh, sorry."
Tammy 2,None taken.
Tammy 2,That's not even possible.
Tammy 2,"""Three fistfuls of hair."""
Tammy 2,"Good day, Leslie."
Tammy 2,I will defeat you right into my pants.
Tammy 2,Sounds like a real whore.
Tammy 2,"You're still the same old Ron Swanson, and I will defeat you."
Tammy 2,With whom?
Tammy 2,A relationship?
Tammy 2,How dare you? Are you kidding me? You'll be back.
Tammy 2,What?
Tammy 2,This little domestic charade of yours hasn't changed you one bit.
Tammy 2,"You're not fooling me, Ron."
Tammy 2,Whoo!
Tammy 2,"Trolling for some dad ""D."""
Tammy 2,I pronounced that wrong.
Tammy 2,They all come back! They call come back!

Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,"Hey, Jerebear."
Tammy 2,Don't think I won't do it.
Tammy 2,"Hey, Glenn."
Tammy 2,"So exciting, Ron."
Tammy 2,That's 'cause you're my widdle baby!
Tammy 2,Mmm.
Tammy 2,Ooh!
Tammy 2,"Actually, I prefer the number 69 train to Humpsville station."
Tammy 2,Guess I'll be heading home.
Tammy 2,"Hey, Andy."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Tammy 2,"Oh, yeah."
Tammy 2,We bought 10 cases of Gatorade and a 40-pound bag of peanuts for energy.
Tammy 2,How's it hanging?
Tammy 2,"Hey, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Stay out of this, Glenn."
Tammy 2,"What's the matter, little boy? Did the bad people get to you?"
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron's friend."
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,There you are.
Tammy 2,Who's this tall drink of water?
Tammy 2,Ah.
Tammy 2,What is your problem?
Tammy 2,"Nothing's changed, has it?"
Tammy 2,I'm just kidding.
Tammy 2,"My gosh, I mean, you did have 3 dollars worth of fines, but I cleared them."
Tammy 2,"We government gals have to watch each other's backs, right?"
Tammy 2,"Why are you hitting yourself, Glenn? Stop hitting yourself."
Tammy 2,"He's attacking me, Ron! Kill him! Yeah! Do your worst, Glenn! You're gonna have to do better than that."
Tammy 2,Tell you what.
Tammy 2,It's been long enough.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, I would never do anything to help you."
Tammy 2,Give me the keys!
Tammy 2,Give 'em to me!
Tammy 2,What do you say we consummate our relationship tonight? Huh? Let's do it.
Tammy 2,Straight as an arrow.
Tammy 2,What?
Tammy 2,You cut me off.
Tammy 2,You!
Tammy 2,They will definitively prove nothing.
Tammy 2,Nothing.
Tammy 2,"She can pinpoint your weaknesses, and then destroy you with just one word."
Tammy 2,With mommy?
Tammy 2,"Oh, yeah, tell me you're not feeling this."
Tammy 2,Ron and I are going to get a cup of coffee and talk things out.
Tammy 2,"Besides, I like to keep tabs on Ron."
Tammy 2,"So I can have fun with him, and sometimes ruining his life can be a part of that, sure."
Tammy 2,"Leslie, Leslie, Leslie."
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God, I am so turned on right now."
Tammy 2,And a jar of acid.
Tammy 2,"You're a big part of the reason that he and I aren't together, and I had to settle for this placeholder."
Tammy 2,You've always been against me and Ron.
Tammy 2,Absolutely.
Tammy 2,I have several photographs that will definitively prove
Tammy 2,Ah! I'm going in!
Tammy 2,"Who set the bed on fire, huh?"
Tammy 2,I got 'em! I got 'em.
Tammy 2,Just like somebody else I know.
Tammy 2,Two of my lovers in one place.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, have fun with this trial."
Tammy 2,A guy traded me his seat for a peek and a squeeze.
Tammy 2,Ron's got one just like it on his penis.
Tammy 2,"Okay, bye, guys."
Tammy 2,"Oh, Chris so silly."
Tammy 2,"Don't listen to Leslie, she's just trying to manipulate you."
Tammy 2,Rock and roll!
Tammy 2,"Look, we're sitting at the same table!"
Tammy 2,"Yeah, baby!"
Tammy 2,I don't have any evidence.
Tammy 2,"Come back, come back."
Tammy 2,"Well, hello there, Big"
Tammy 2,All she cares about is herself and I can prove it.
Tammy 2,"That's my boob and my butt, respectively."
Tammy 2,Just one dance?
Tammy 2,Gross! Leslie? Where's Ron?
Tammy 2,Wanna bet? That relationship is weak.
Tammy 2,What a coincidence.
Tammy 2,"Remember that, Ron?"
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,You're gonna regret this!
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,No--
Tammy 2,"Leslie, no--"
Tammy 2,Leslie! Stop this car! Where are we going?
Tammy 2,Help you get your park.
Tammy 2,"You have overdue book fees totaling 3 dollars, missy."
Tammy 2,"How's this, Leslie? You leave us alone, and we swing the vote to you."
Tammy 2,You have a lot of nerve showing your face here.
Tammy 2,What a coinkydinky.
Tammy 2,"All I have to do is find Ron within the next few hours, and he's toast."
Tammy 2,"Oh, my gosh."
Tammy 2,"Leslie, you and I both know that the library closes at 3:00 p.m."
Tammy 2,"Hey, Ron, why don't you get me out of these handcuffs, so I can put you into these handcuffs."
Tammy 2,Ah! You'll never catch me!
Tammy 2,He's my man.
Tammy 2,And we have something twisted and beautiful.
Tammy 2,It means a lot.
Tammy 2,"Hello, you gorgeous craftsmen."
Tammy 2,"Wow, look at this room."
Tammy 2,"Thanks, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Listen, Tammy One was my Sunday school teacher, too."
Tammy 2,Couldn't we go have a cup of coffee?
Tammy 2,Okay.
Tammy 2,You want Ron.
Tammy 2,That's what this is all about.
Tammy 2,"Hi, Ron."
Tammy 2,"So much wood, ready to be worked."
Tammy 2,"What? Hey, baby."
Tammy 2,"I'm sorry about this, but I just really wanna talk to you."
Tammy 2,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Tammy 2,You're a miracle worker.
Tammy 2,Stay out of this.
Tammy 2,Jerky?
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God."
Tammy 2,You son of a bitch.
Tammy 2,Wait a minute.
Tammy 2,"It's really good to see you, Ron."
Tammy 2,"And more importantly, does the carpet match the face?"
Tammy 2,This is our relationship.
Tammy 2,Ron brought you here to break up with me for him?
Tammy 2,"What Ron wants to do is leave here right now, go to the sleaziest motel in town, and wrap himself around me like a coiled snake."
Tammy 2,I'm pretty sure he does.
Tammy 2,"When Ron left her and we got together, she threw acid on my foot."
Tammy 2,Tell that to your pants tent.
Tammy 2,"Ooh, what happened here?"
Tammy 2,Hi.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, Ron doesn't wanna break up with me."
Tammy 2,"Baby, don't you see what's happening here? She's manipulating you because she's jealous of me, and the things I get to do to your body and face."
Tammy 2,Oh.
Tammy 2,We were married twice.
Tammy 2,"If I'd had a park like that when I was growing up, I probably wouldn't have gone through such a prolonged mall slut phase."
Tammy 2,Yay!
Tammy 2,That's right.
Tammy 2,"Listen, you guys got there first."
Tammy 2,"I'm gonna withdraw my request for the lot, as a professional courtesy to you."
Tammy 2,"Hey, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Government gals, right?"
Tammy 2,Wow.
Tammy 2,Get away from this car!
Tammy 2,No! What are you doing? You're crazy!
Tammy 2,"He's lying, Ron."
Tammy 2,Ron! Ron!
Tammy 2,"Did it work, baby?"
Tammy 2,Are you horny with gratitude?
Tammy 2,"Oh, I just have a little something I need to get drilled."
Tammy 2,"Gosh, I never dreamed you'd be here."
Tammy 2,Sit down.
Tammy 2,Please.
Tammy 2,I swear I don't have cloven feet.
Tammy 2,What a coincidence.
Tammy 2,Ron tends to exaggerate when it comes to me.
Tammy 2,Did you talk to Ron?
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,Twice exwife.
Tania,I wouldn't.
Tania,The first course is a Mexican bean soup.
Tania,It's just that learning to cook is very important in this day and age.
Tania,I know.
Tania,"And I think that they are a very good sampling of what my level one class does, which I hope you'll keep in mind when you're making your decisions."
Tania,"Okay, the appetizers are almost ready."
Tania,They're very hot.
Tania,Excuse me?
Tania,It won't influence your decision.
Tania,Are you cutting our classes?
Tanya,"Okay, couldn't you put Sue's Salads here?"
Tanya,It's just-- There's so many junk food places and only one salad stand.
Tanya,"Mm, I've never seen you buy a salad at Sue's Salads."
Tanya,Salad's are my life.
Tanya,"Well that's great, thank you."
Terrence Montreaux,I own 12.
Terrence Montreaux,"I am here to find the best sommeliers as soon as they are, how you say, certified."
Terrence Montreaux,That is everyone's idea.
Terrence Montreaux,"That is why we have this, how do you say, thing."
Terrence Montreaux,"No, monsieur."
Terrence Montreaux,Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Terrence Montreaux,Mon dieu!
The Decembrists,This is truly an amazing town.
The Decembrists,"I will hang my head hang my head low, low, low"
The Decembrists,It's great to be here in support of this event.
The Decembrists,We're The Decembrists.
The Decembrists,"I ordered a small cheeseburger, and both the buns were pizzas."
The Decembrists,"Hello, Pawnee."
The Douche,"Come on, Ben."
The Douche,I studied semiotics.
The Douche,"I mean, I know it's a silly thing to do, but it pays the bills."
The Douche,"It started as satire, and, you know, we snowballed to where we are today."
The Douche,"You know, the douche persona is something I came up with during college."
The Douche,Yeah.
The Douche,They were in the bathroom a long time.
The Douche,Who knows? She's probably a lesbian.
The Douche,"She spent the whole night talking to her friend, arguing about their feelings."
The Douche,"Actually, a farting immigrant segment would be really funny."
The Douche,"No, no, no, no."
The Douche,"Come on, man."
The Douche,"So listen, Crazy Ira, check this out, okay? I'm at this club last night just killing it, the Snakehole Lounge."
The Douche,"All right, ""B""."
The Douche,Wrote a thesis on narrative forms in the digital world.
The Douche,Ga-ga-goink!
The Douche,Northwestern.
The Douche,"What's up, ladies?"
The Douche,So I'm dancing on the floor with this super-hot chick.
The Douche,"I know it's a winter's morn, but it feels like a summer's eve, 'cause ""the douche"" is in the building."
The Douche,"Ay dios Good looking out, Leslie."
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
The Douche,It's the next big step in this grand adventure that we call life.
The Douche,"You know, I've thought a lot about having kids."
The Douche,I'm gonna turn the mayoral office into my oral office.
The Douche,Wow.
The Douche,My oral office.
The Douche,Let me know.
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
The Douche,"You guys ever want to do this again, sans clothing, give me a shout."
The Douche,You wanna funk this junk in the back of my trunk?
The Douche,"So, how are you liking Pawnee?"
The Douche,"Good talk, Ice Town."
The Douche,You guys know where the library is?
The Douche,Douche nation.
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
The Douche,It sounds really interesting.
The Douche,"Honestly, good luck on this project."
The Douche,"'Sup, Leslie?"
The Douche,And some gross things with those juicy City Hall interns.
The Douche,I could do some great things for this city.
The Douche,Looks like you two need to kiss and make up.
The Douche,"Call me ""The Douche."""
The Douche,"Oh, please."
The Douche,"Is there enough room for some ""manaise"" in this lady sandwich?"
The Douche,Uhoh.
The Douche,You have three seconds to answer or we're gonna withdraw a donation from charity.
The Douche,A morning shockjock DJ the Mayor?
The Douche,I can understand that.
The Douche,"You probably know me from my morning radio show on 93.7, ""Crazy Ira and The Douche."""
The Douche,I took it.
The Douche,As the official town slogan for pawneecity.gov.
The Douche,"Hey, Crazy Ira, have you seen my stick?"
The Douche,I don't know.
The Douche,"Lesbo Baggins, you know where my stick is?"
The Douche,Oh!
The Douche,Found my stick.
The Douche,Up Leslie Knope's butt!
The Douche,"We're running out of time here so just a quick reminder to write-in ""Welcome to Douche nation!"""
The Douche,Wait!
The Douche,Were you on the show where we had that stripper do math?
The Douche,How would you rate Emma Watson's boobs?
The Douche,Classic.
The Douche,Thank you.
The Douche,Sitting right here.
The Douche,"""If you're looking for douches, they're in Aisle Me."""
The Douche,"I've worked on two political campaigns, and I spend all of my time communicating with the public."
The Douche,I used my classic pickup line.
The Douche,I went to Northwestern.
The Douche,"Followup question, Leslie, show us your boobs!"
The Douche,"Oh, what up, Lez?"
The Douche,Backwards hatshows a real lack of respect for authority.
The Douche,I like that.
The Douche,"What's up, little mayor?"
The Douche,But keep an open mind.
The Douche,Are you gonna freak out again?
The Douche,"Classic, right?"
The Douche,"Yeah, we are in store for another Leslie Knope nag sesh?"
The Douche,"On a scale, from 1 to gagagagoing!"
The Douche,"Well, frankly, I don't think it's for you to decide."
The Douche,"You know, if we had a little girl, I would name her Elizabeth, after my grandmother."
The Douche,"I'm gonna scan a quick pic of them boobies for a little deposit in ""El banco de spanko."""
The Douche,"And if we had a boy, I don't know, I'd name him something funny, like ""Dick"" or ""O.J."""
The Douche,"Thought of it a second ago, had to pop back in."
The Douche,Had to.
The Douche,"Okay, we're back."
The Douche,"We, uh, got an update on ""Operation Baby douche."""
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,"Houston, we have a-- What do you think about that, Neil Armstrong?"
The Douche,"Oh, she's in there! She's into it now!"
The Douche,"All right, special guest is Councilwoman Leslie Knope."
The Douche,"How are you, les?"
The Douche,The fartsicle.
The Douche,Frozen farts you can eat.
The Douche,"She was this strong, amazing woman."
The Douche,"Yeah! Oh, she's touching her boobs now."
The Douche,Put it in your facemouth!
The Douche,Fair's fair.
The Douche,Classic.
The Douche,"Let's keep our eye on the ball here, Douche nation, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt."""
The Douche,"Sorry, Councilwoman."
The Douche,I'm in it to win it.
The Douche,The douche is gonna be a daddy.
The Douche,Cause The Cosby Show.
The Douche,"All right, I will stop talking about your friend if you get in that Jello for one second and say, ""Rudy."""
The Douche,Don't you want your constituents to know that you got a fun side?
The Douche,"I mean, this is fun."
The Douche,Oh! Yeah!
The Douche,"We've got Leslie Knope and Tom ""Haverfart"" and Ben Wyatt."
The Douche,Switching gears here now.
The Douche,That's right.
The Douche,Guess I have a lot to consider.
The Douche,"So, Crazy Ira, remember that chick Ann I used to"
The Douche,"Turns out, she wants to have my baby."
The Douche,Come on!
The Douche,"Come on over, Ben."
The Douche,Yeah.
The Douche,"Anyway, her lesbo friend tells me she's on the prowl for some baby beans And it's down to me and some other turdmunchers."
The Douche,And they're in the hizzy to talk about an upcoming event called the Harvest Festival.
The Douche,City goes bankrupt.
The Douche,Boom!
The Douche,"Yeah, he's 18, becomes the mayor, and then blows the whole budget on an ice skating rink."
The Douche,"Okay, I will lay off if you can survive one round with Breasty Bertha in The Jello Pit!"
The Douche,To your mom.
The Douche,I really wish you guys could see this guy right now. He is drenched in sweat.
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,Let's take a caller from Douche Nation.
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,Let's vote on it right now! Butt stick! Butt stick!
The Douche,"Talk to me, caller."
The Douche,"Game over, man."
The Douche,"""Hey, ride me,"" is what Crazy Ira's mom said."
Theodore,"I'm sorry, buddy, daddy can't get home to tuck you in."
Theodore,Just pick a thing.
Theodore,You just destroyed my case.
Theodore,I don't really know.
Theodore,"No, it wasn't."
Theodore,Just take it and get outta here.
Theodore,I don't know what any of that means.
Theodore,I think so.
Theodore,Just please be careful with my store?
Theodore,Unbelievable.
Theodore,"They clearly meant ""tea."""
Theodore,Sorry.
Theodore,I own your car now.
Theodore,Here's a quarter.
Theodore,"Hey, can I see your keys for a second?"
Theodore,You want to enforce every single old law we have on our books?
Theodore,"Okay, fine."
Theodore,"Second, it was a misprint."
Theodore,"As always, I object."
Theodore,I don't even go by Ted!
Theodore,I go by Theodore!
Theodore,Aah!
Theodore,"Okay, first of all, ""That's the way it's always been done"" is not a good reason to keep doing something."
Theodore,"And I talked to the other Teds in town, and they're not doing it either."
Theodore,I'm not getting dumped in that lake anymore.
Theodore,I'm serious.
Theodore,"Listen, I am just here to say that I am done with Ted Party Day."
Theodore,"Whoa, I think we should be careful when we speculate what the Founders intended when they wrote the charter."
Theodore,The Pawnee Charter clearly states that any white citizen has the right to seize any Indian property for 25 cents.
Theodore,"You, a woman, just raised your voice to a landowning male."
Theodore,Hello?
Theodore,Ring's yours again.
Theodore,Okay.
Theodore,Credit card's been fully refunded.
Theodore,"Okay, you're all set."
Theodore,Uhoh.
Theodore,"If you like, I could engrave the date on the inside of the band."
Theodore,This is a beauty.
Theodore,"Oh, come on."
Theodore,Congratulations.
Theodore,"I assume this is a, you know"
Theodore,When's the big day?
Theodore,"Hi, folks."
Theodore,"According to a Pawnee statute passed in 1868, I get to do this."
Theodore,"Yeah, that was hilarious."
Tom Haverford,Do you think there's any chance your dad will give up?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should just throw in the towel.
Tom Haverford,I'll be left with nothing.
Tom Haverford,That's not a good piece of advice.
Tom Haverford,Thought I was a better-looking version of Zuckerberg.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, come on!"
Tom Haverford,Your dad'll destroy me.
Tom Haverford,"If she finds out that we broke up, I'll go bankrupt."
Tom Haverford,"More importantly, I bet Donna 1,000 dollars that we'd be together for another month."
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,"Now, look at this place."
Tom Haverford,Turns out I'm the better-looking version of the Winklevoss twins.
Tom Haverford,I can't stress this enough.
Tom Haverford,It's dead!
Tom Haverford,What am I gonna do?
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I'm basically Babyface."
Tom Haverford,You're right.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm gonna keep going, and I'm gonna beat your dad."
Tom Haverford,I was spreading swag around town like a killer swag virus.
Tom Haverford,My clothes were flying off the rack.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Ben."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna make it rain. I'm just gonna pick that up real quick.
Tom Haverford,Is it?
Tom Haverford,Interesting choice.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"No, Ron."
Tom Haverford,My tummy's rumbling.
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,"Dr. Saperstein, your son is my best friend."
Tom Haverford,He's like a brother to me.
Tom Haverford,"The banana you wanted, senor."
Tom Haverford,"But he's a disaster, and your daughter seriously needs to be locked up in some sort of insane asylum."
Tom Haverford,In space.
Tom Haverford,Just spending a little time with my baby girl.
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, image consultant, swagger coach."
Tom Haverford,Tommy's got the tumrums.
Tom Haverford,So So now you know the truth.
Tom Haverford,Will you back off?
Tom Haverford,It's scary.
Tom Haverford,What look did your mom have on her face when she realized her son was a complete failure?
Tom Haverford,On an island
Tom Haverford,You said they might not know what toilet paper is.
Tom Haverford,"Right now, I want to turn the floor over to Jean-Ralphio, who has something to say."
Tom Haverford,It's really a dream come true.
Tom Haverford,Cash money.
Tom Haverford,But guess what?
Tom Haverford,I find it incredibly demeaning.
Tom Haverford,Gracias.
Tom Haverford,"Weird choice, but for you, I got it done."
Tom Haverford,"Antonio, Nestle Crunch with the crispy rice removed."
Tom Haverford,"Raul, Butterfinger."
Tom Haverford,"Elvis, Oh Henry!"
Tom Haverford,"Three weeks ago, this place was hopping."
Tom Haverford,Don't forget to grab a free iPad on your way out.
Tom Haverford,"But with all due respect, as far as business decisions go, I think we know what we're doing."
Tom Haverford,"They're trying to put me out of business, and it's working."
Tom Haverford,That's my competition.
Tom Haverford,"Ben, thanks for your time."
Tom Haverford,"I know, man."
Tom Haverford,'Cause I'm pretty sure it wasn't you two bozos.
Tom Haverford,"Hey guys, which two people here started their own company?"
Tom Haverford,I can't believe I used to date you!
Tom Haverford,"Thank you all for coming, and let me just say how truly, deeply trill it is to be standing in this dope-ass conference room, addressing a group of people in a business meeting."
Tom Haverford,"You got it, Chief."
Tom Haverford,Huge.
Tom Haverford,"I didn't have time to make it into anything, and please don't eat it 'cause it cost $55 an ounce."
Tom Haverford,What'd he call me?
Tom Haverford,What did I ever do to you?
Tom Haverford,"Dr. Saperstein, why are you doing this?"
Tom Haverford,What's all this?
Tom Haverford,"Ann, Chris, can we have the room, please?"
Tom Haverford,I bought that one personally.
Tom Haverford,As a thank-you.
Tom Haverford,JeanRalphio!
Tom Haverford,Donna told me I'd find you up here.
Tom Haverford,It's an iPad.
Tom Haverford,The stripes are so wavy.
Tom Haverford,You're the one that's trying to put me out of business!
Tom Haverford,"It's really... all right, I can't keep this facade up any longer."
Tom Haverford,You're JeanRalphio's dad!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I need a favor.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing here?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, wow."
Tom Haverford,What am I doing?
Tom Haverford,"Dwayne ""the Rock"" Swanson."
Tom Haverford,"Well, the target demographic isn't angry, middle aged nurses."
Tom Haverford,"Again, good advice."
Tom Haverford,"My restaurant opens in six weeks, and I'm making sure I get every detail right."
Tom Haverford,This is the hardest I've worked on anything since... Wow.
Tom Haverford,Here.
Tom Haverford,I've never worked hard on anything.
Tom Haverford,What a cool life!
Tom Haverford,Why don't we?
Tom Haverford,"Wait, you're serious?"
Tom Haverford,We could do a soft opening tomorrow and be ready just in time for the concert crowd.
Tom Haverford,"I guarantee it'll work and in six months, this place will be bigger than McDonald's."
Tom Haverford,Mitch is right.
Tom Haverford,The amount of buzz we get from opening next weekend is too big to pass up.
Tom Haverford,We can do it.
Tom Haverford,"""This little Italian restaurant will put McDonald's out of business"" on three."
Tom Haverford,"One, two, three."
Tom Haverford,This little Italian restaurant will be bigger than McDonald's!
Tom Haverford,"Well, nobody can predict the future except me."
Tom Haverford,"If we don't start making changes, we're gonna lose the company."
Tom Haverford,You know those chairs you were making for my restaurant?
Tom Haverford,I caught you!
Tom Haverford,"She got me off the Williams-Sonoma mailing list, but then I just signed back up again."
Tom Haverford,Hooked on their oven mitts.
Tom Haverford,"In the meantime, we' gonna be playing video games, tweeting our high scores."
Tom Haverford,"If you need anything, one of these models that we pay to hang around here will grab it for you."
Tom Haverford,I need my mitts on those mitts.
Tom Haverford,"According to her Twitter feed, she got coffee five minutes ago."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, now she's Ustreaming her walk back."
Tom Haverford,Donna is great with this sort of thing.
Tom Haverford,"She should be here in three, two, one."
Tom Haverford,"""Yeah, man."""
Tom Haverford,"Hashtag quest for coffee, blowin' up my timeline."
Tom Haverford,You get my snapchat about it?
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, Tom, I heard you and Lucy broke up."""
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,You look like a weird goon who's obsessed with a kid's book.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah?"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, hey."
Tom Haverford,I need 'em now.
Tom Haverford,Mm.
Tom Haverford,"""Turns out she's crazy."""
Tom Haverford,Aha!
Tom Haverford,What are they doing here?
Tom Haverford,Ann and Chris?
Tom Haverford,"""1020 Maple Street."""
Tom Haverford,Done and done.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna."
Tom Haverford,"Please, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,It's a free circular with a bunch of coupons in it.
Tom Haverford,I've never asked you for anything today.
Tom Haverford,It feels like I just exercised.
Tom Haverford,"You really think this will work, Donna?"
Tom Haverford,"Please, you're really far behind."
Tom Haverford,My legs are tired.
Tom Haverford,"Man, I'm hungry."
Tom Haverford,That's what they always do on Entourage.
Tom Haverford,Wait.
Tom Haverford,Uh This is Ben.
Tom Haverford,Check out this video April sent me.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, come see this!"
Tom Haverford,We brought in five accountants to look at e720 and they all said the same thing you did.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'm white chocolate and I'm bucking all the stereotypes.
Tom Haverford,Am I filled with little rice krispies?
Tom Haverford,We also got basketball at any time you want.
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"Do I have a little gooey, caramel center?"
Tom Haverford,"Now the question still remained, ""what kind of chocolate am I?"""
Tom Haverford,"Obviously chocolate, 'cause I'm sweet, smooth, and the ladies love me."
Tom Haverford,Let's move in together.
Tom Haverford,Gracias.
Tom Haverford,Coffee?
Tom Haverford,Brandy?
Tom Haverford,"When I was trying to decide how to decorate my office, I had to ask myself, ""what kind of candy should I choose?"""
Tom Haverford,"Anything, guys?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Some nuts?
Tom Haverford,Gummi Bears?
Tom Haverford,Can I get anyone anything to drink before we start?
Tom Haverford,Apple crisps?
Tom Haverford,"Ultimately, I decided to go with a little gourmet fudge."
Tom Haverford,"No takebacks when we sober up, though, partner."
Tom Haverford,Jello shot!
Tom Haverford,I need some better friends.
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to paradise, my man."
Tom Haverford,"'Cause I love that, baby."
Tom Haverford,"Are we saying ""Snapple"" anytime we think something's dope?"
Tom Haverford,Get him the books.
Tom Haverford,Baby!
Tom Haverford,He's here to help us with the paperwork.
Tom Haverford,"You got it, baby."
Tom Haverford,"What's the deal, baby?"
Tom Haverford,You can chill over there by the bar.
Tom Haverford,"And promote the company by going to clubs and tossing the bills in the air and screaming, ""Free money!"""
Tom Haverford,By literally printing out our money.
Tom Haverford,Wanna know how we make money?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, look who it is."
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom.
Tom Haverford,"One second, you hit the party switch, and the next second, you're all business?"
Tom Haverford,Granola bars?
Tom Haverford,Nothing?
Tom Haverford,Sure?
Tom Haverford,"What up, Roy?"
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,All this lying about me stops now!
Tom Haverford,Why would you say that?
Tom Haverford,"""Disco Dairy."""
Tom Haverford,Any idea why he'd believe such a thing?
Tom Haverford,So he was gonna screw me back.
Tom Haverford,"NBA's on strike, so we got him for only, like, 75% of his original NBA salary."
Tom Haverford,That's a Merino wool throw for my Eames chair!
Tom Haverford,Spread the party.
Tom Haverford,He told me that I had screwed you out of my business
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, JeanRalphio."
Tom Haverford,"It's dirty, and I'm wearing my summer linens."
Tom Haverford,"No, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,I wanted to apologize.
Tom Haverford,And keep your mouth shut.
Tom Haverford,That's not a picnic blanket.
Tom Haverford,This is my life.
Tom Haverford,"Please, one of you has to tell him the truth."
Tom Haverford,Dress loud.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I'll be right out there if you need me.
Tom Haverford,"I told you, gold sequin sweatpants."
Tom Haverford,Everyone said it wouldn't last.
Tom Haverford,"Ann and Tom, aka Haverkins, are stronger than ever."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, thank God."
Tom Haverford,Are you crazy? You could buy a low-end Lexus with that money.
Tom Haverford,I'm starving.
Tom Haverford,Raisins?
Tom Haverford,"Pro, 35,000 dollars worth of dirty money."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,I'm experimenting with some new entrepreneurial ideas.
Tom Haverford,There's Roy Hibbert and Detlef Schrempf.
Tom Haverford,"Pro, yes it does."
Tom Haverford,"That one's called ""Sparkle Suds."""
Tom Haverford,"No such luck, Donna."
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Tom Haverford,Regal Meagle.
Tom Haverford,"The more she's mentioned a word, the larger it appears."
Tom Haverford,It's a gel-based serum.
Tom Haverford,"Second of all, who uses mousse still?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Let's put our differences aside for a second.
Tom Haverford,"Friend to friend, do you still use mousse?"
Tom Haverford,Stu's sales are flat.
Tom Haverford,Lemonade's the future.
Tom Haverford,I'm still doing my presentation.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,I spent a lot of time on this.
Tom Haverford,"Good work, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, I just needed to ask him about this one thing, but we're all good now."
Tom Haverford,"Suck it, Paris, France."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, you are."
Tom Haverford,I'm ejecting you.
Tom Haverford,"You're ejected, too."
Tom Haverford,Just one example of innovation.
Tom Haverford,"I say ""the 'tails."""
Tom Haverford,There's nothing more American than lemonade.
Tom Haverford,Just sayin' the word makes you wanna drink some.
Tom Haverford,And now you can.
Tom Haverford,what if I just introduce you for your speech?
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Ron's ejected for molesting the ref!
Tom Haverford,And Entertainment 720.
Tom Haverford,"I can paint, but, uh, I can also be a world-class gambler."
Tom Haverford,I'm like Picasso meets Michael Jordan.
Tom Haverford,"I'm great at business, and I'm great at parks stuff."
Tom Haverford,"Collect enough aqua badges, and we'll welcome you to the H-2-flow Platinum Club."
Tom Haverford,"Get enough sparkle points, and you're on your way to your first aqua badge!"
Tom Haverford,"The more flow you take in, the more sparkle points you get."
Tom Haverford,Think of H-2-flow as an app for your teeth.
Tom Haverford,"Well, miss, I think we'd all appreciate it if you just swallowed a teaspoon of hush."
Tom Haverford,The presentation.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know about y'all, but Drink-ems seems pretty boring to me, not like H-2-flow."
Tom Haverford,"Look, I think you need to take a page out of my system and chill out a bit, okay?"
Tom Haverford,I got this.
Tom Haverford,What's that?
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"It's short, Can we let it play please?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"It went down exactly the way my girl said it did, you mean, bald man."
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 has been a fixture of this community since June.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,How about we watch this brief promotional film?
Tom Haverford,"My name is Tom Haverford, and I'm here to tell you a little bit about Pawnee's premiere entertainment and multimedia conglomerate, Entertainment 720 where dreams come, they come true"
Tom Haverford,"Hi, folks."
Tom Haverford,"Thank you so much for that amazing intro, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,Check under your seats.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it does."
Tom Haverford,"Classic for you, Carter."
Tom Haverford,"Darva, yours is a pink lemonade."
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
Tom Haverford,"I say ""T,"" you say ""dazzle."""
Tom Haverford,Everyone who tweets at T-Dazzle in the next hour will be entered to win an exciting plain blue Tshirt.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"That water contains teeth dazzler, which makes your teeth stronger and starts a party in your mouth."
Tom Haverford,Then try this.
Tom Haverford,What? Macy's? That wasn't me.
Tom Haverford,There's a Macy's in town? Where's the Macy's in town? I heard they have an amazing cologne sample guy.
Tom Haverford,I quit to peruse my dream.
Tom Haverford,And my dream collapsed.
Tom Haverford,"It's embarrassing, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I can't go from a CEO back to being an administrator.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, this is embarrassing."
Tom Haverford,Even for you.
Tom Haverford,I'm not coming back.
Tom Haverford,"Peace out, my dudes."
Tom Haverford,I'll say it again: The men's room needs a separate dispenser for face wash.
Tom Haverford,I can't wash my face with hand soap.
Tom Haverford,Look at these pores.
Tom Haverford,They're gaping.
Tom Haverford,Timeout.
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
Tom Haverford,And what's the most important part of a presentation?
Tom Haverford,Everyone's ejected.
Tom Haverford,Move!
Tom Haverford,I know you love that.
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,"Now, who here likes laser shows?"
Tom Haverford,Summer foot traffic in Lafayette Park has increased 23%.
Tom Haverford,The Indiana Brothers are the fastest-growing beverage company in the Midwest.
Tom Haverford,My projections show they can increase government revenue 30% over the next five years.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, they've agreed to waive their franchise fee."
Tom Haverford,Here's a little gift for you for believing in me.
Tom Haverford,"Most people would probably say ""the deets."""
Tom Haverford,It's a gel-based hair serum.
Tom Haverford,"Enough with the mousse, for real."
Tom Haverford,The details.
Tom Haverford,"What are we gonna do now, Leslie?"
Tom Haverford,It is a baller move.
Tom Haverford,Damn.
Tom Haverford,Give you the 'tails?
Tom Haverford,Mind if I steal you away for a few seconds?
Tom Haverford,"My company, Entertainment 720, has an amazing business opportunity for Kernston's."
Tom Haverford,I just said it.
Tom Haverford,"Get out of here, dude!"
Tom Haverford,A lot of people say the Harvest Festival is what launched Entertainment 720.
Tom Haverford,It was incredible.
Tom Haverford,"Martin, Tom Haverford I threw this shindig"
Tom Haverford,Seriously?
Tom Haverford,I'm working on it right now.
Tom Haverford,Au contraire.
Tom Haverford,"I can't reveal my identity because of various corporate enemies, but suffice it to say, I run a fairly popular social networking site."
Tom Haverford,We're hemorrhaging cash ever since we opened.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"What's the matter there, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,"I guess I just didn't moisturize enough this morning, and I've been laying around"
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,No players left?
Tom Haverford,And I'm all pruney.
Tom Haverford,I'm too sad to get out.
Tom Haverford,Andy's team!
Tom Haverford,Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Plastic surgery?
Tom Haverford,"They were duds, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Really, anything would be better than the people we interviewed today."
Tom Haverford,That's a hot mogul right now.
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,But a real estate mogul?
Tom Haverford,A mogul mogul.
Tom Haverford,I even thought about downhill skiing.
Tom Haverford,"Fashion mogul, energy drink mogul."
Tom Haverford,"The question I always ask myself is, what kind of mogul should I be?"
Tom Haverford,Split that commish
Tom Haverford,"If they did, I'd sell 'em."
Tom Haverford,"Yo, Donna, let me get a little skin in the game, maybe split that commission?"
Tom Haverford,They say you've got to spend money to make money.
Tom Haverford,Tommy trees.
Tom Haverford,It never hurts.
Tom Haverford,"You showed up at the guy's house in the middle of the night, drunk, and you didn't even sleep with him?"
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should start working on my cologne line.
Tom Haverford,"For the first two weeks, we told everyone we were booked solid to make people want us more."
Tom Haverford,That was a business tactic.
Tom Haverford,I might have to get a temp job.
Tom Haverford,No idea.
Tom Haverford,Thank God.
Tom Haverford,Where are we gonna get Albacore tuna with crispy onions at this hour?
Tom Haverford,There it is.
Tom Haverford,Duke! Huge fan.
Tom Haverford,Mm.
Tom Haverford,Crocheted.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, duh."
Tom Haverford,But what kind of scarves do we want to hang off the fake antlers?
Tom Haverford,"For the fireplace, I'm thinking fake antlers."
Tom Haverford,"Donna, baby."
Tom Haverford,"Say, ""I bested you!"""
Tom Haverford,Diane making you sell this place?
Tom Haverford,"So what's the story, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,That... That was a lovely photo.
Tom Haverford,Truce.
Tom Haverford,You're kidding me.
Tom Haverford,You're ejected.
Tom Haverford,We spent all of our money.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I don't know where we went wrong."
Tom Haverford,Let's take a brief recess.
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I'm like a shark.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, can you do me a favor and just let me sit here?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, once you got on the city council, we kinda stopped doin' that."
Tom Haverford,Am I dead?
Tom Haverford,"Well, I have my own system."
Tom Haverford,Step one: Chill out a bit.
Tom Haverford,Step two: Get up there and rip it.
Tom Haverford,Le'go.
Tom Haverford,It's parked right outside.
Tom Haverford,Now come join me and let's all take a dip in the e720 mobile hot tub!
Tom Haverford,I want all of y'all to write down the name and direct phone line for whoever's in charge of hiring independent contractors for your business!
Tom Haverford,Please welcome the e720 mailing list divas!
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I'll go back to your system."
Tom Haverford,You're the big dog around here.
Tom Haverford,Let's get right to it.
Tom Haverford,Agreed.
Tom Haverford,That is impressive.
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh! Guess who won that plain blue T-shirt?
Tom Haverford,That's who that was?
Tom Haverford,I invented Facebook.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, flipped through it."
Tom Haverford,Looks good.
Tom Haverford,I hope you liked this story.
Tom Haverford,"And let's face it, booking e720 was the smartest decision I ever made."
Tom Haverford,I'm not getting out.
Tom Haverford,No can do.
Tom Haverford,Deal with it.
Tom Haverford,You made me the ref.
Tom Haverford,"What you carrying, my dude?"
Tom Haverford,Video Ron demand.
Tom Haverford,I don't swim backwards.
Tom Haverford,"See ya later, man."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, it shows everyone's spirit dogs."
Tom Haverford,That one's you.
Tom Haverford,Look at them go!
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 is dead.
Tom Haverford,Okay?
Tom Haverford,My company's bankrupt.
Tom Haverford,"First on the agenda: I'm gonna bring my lemonade stand idea to the small business coalition, and a little birdie told me it's already in the bag."
Tom Haverford,Can I get a what what?
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I downloaded this dope app that pops champagne whenever I say something awesome."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,And it was only 9 bucks.
Tom Haverford,"There's no vans within 50 miles, and, for some reason, no one wants to lend me $10,000."
Tom Haverford,"Don't sweat it, Lezkno."
Tom Haverford,Tommy's taking care of every last detail.
Tom Haverford,Don't move.
Tom Haverford,Let's just stay here.
Tom Haverford,"For like an hour, and not let him out."
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, get away from me."
Tom Haverford,"Well, hindsight is 20/20."
Tom Haverford,"Can we help you, Ann?"
Tom Haverford,It's a monthly gathering where we all get together and vent about what annoys us at work.
Tom Haverford,I'm deleting you from my phone.
Tom Haverford,You're finally free of my animal magnetism.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe one day years from now when we're both old and Chris is dead, you'll run into me somewhere."
Tom Haverford,I'll be opening my latest mega club.
Tom Haverford,"I'll see you there on the street by yourself and I'll tell the bouncer/my bodyguard, ""Hey, that woman's way too old to get into this club, but why don't you let her in the back?"""
Tom Haverford,"Stay golden, sweetheart."
Tom Haverford,Shh.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, technically my new job is my old job, but I'm not some boring, Jerry Gergich type guy."
Tom Haverford,I'm more of a Steve Harvey.
Tom Haverford,"I dream big, I shake things up, and I always wear dope suits."
Tom Haverford,I got you a going away present.
Tom Haverford,You're gonna treat yourself.
Tom Haverford,"If that costume somehow makes you happy, you're gonna buy it."
Tom Haverford,"Listen to me, you're part of the treat yourself team now, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"I mean that in a good way, Ben."
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no."
Tom Haverford,Wait.
Tom Haverford,This is a whole new level of nerd.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,What are you talking about?
Tom Haverford,"And you're gonna wear it out of the store, okay?"
Tom Haverford,It's quite a ride.
Tom Haverford,"Life, huh?"
Tom Haverford,I'd take your advice if I wanted to be a deadeyed government drone with no ambition.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but there's, like, one corner for you and it's just carob cookies and berries."
Tom Haverford,Let's all put our heads together and brainstorm.
Tom Haverford,We gotta send this dude off with the perfect gift.
Tom Haverford,"I say we start with the three ""Cs,"" cashmere, concert tickets, caboodles of cash."
Tom Haverford,Those are perfect gifts for anyone.
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, I wish you guys were Donna!"
Tom Haverford,I've never been more bored in my entire life.
Tom Haverford,Who cares about letters?
Tom Haverford,"The only good font is the Sopranos one, where the ""r"" is a pistol."
Tom Haverford,"Let's think bigger, people, come on."
Tom Haverford,What about a top to bottom makeover for the entire department?
Tom Haverford,"I'm talking new uniforms, new signage, new color scheme."
Tom Haverford,"A whole, new, sexy vibe."
Tom Haverford,"I sold out, baby."
Tom Haverford,And now I have seed money for my next venture.
Tom Haverford,I am.
Tom Haverford,"Ron said there's nothing more valuable than my name, but he's not a businessman."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I don't know what to tell you, except I'll throw in the name in exchange for 20,000 more and 5% of your client's business."
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,"It's mine, and I'm keeping it."
Tom Haverford,"40,000 for the inventory, the website, and everything else in the store, but I keep the name Rent-a-Swag."
Tom Haverford,"I've made my decision, and I'll sell you Rent-a-Swag, but on my terms."
Tom Haverford,"Cool, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,My gravestone's gonna be a 60-inch touchscreen with a hologram of four mes singing End of the Road by Boyz II Men But point taken.
Tom Haverford,"People are dying to give you money for your business, and you didn't even take it."
Tom Haverford,Easy for you to say.
Tom Haverford,"I don't want to be a failure again, Ron."
Tom Haverford,That was my last shot.
Tom Haverford,It was?
Tom Haverford,A girl like you can have whatever guy she wants.
Tom Haverford,You don't need to jump into anything.
Tom Haverford,That makes sense.
Tom Haverford,Unlike me.
Tom Haverford,Why not? You're a free agent.
Tom Haverford,Nice.
Tom Haverford,We'll be out of business by then.
Tom Haverford,That'll be too late.
Tom Haverford,"So, I heard about you and Chris."
Tom Haverford,And it'd be perfect for Bloosh.
Tom Haverford,And you know how to ride a motorcycle?
Tom Haverford,We're doing amazing.
Tom Haverford,It's a clothing rental service for teens.
Tom Haverford,My store is called RentaSwag.
Tom Haverford,"Stamps, probably."
Tom Haverford,Trigonometry.
Tom Haverford,Accounting.
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna talk to you about things you like to take your mind off the needles, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"Ben, listen."
Tom Haverford,Sex stuff.
Tom Haverford,What were we doing in between?
Tom Haverford,"I'm serious Ann. I might joke about how nice your booty is, but I think you're a really nice person, and I think any guy would be lucky to have you as a girlfriend."
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, dog."
Tom Haverford,How much do you like him? Because I could definitely talk to Lucy about a three way situation.
Tom Haverford,"We all burned our initials in, see?"
Tom Haverford,Get me away from him.
Tom Haverford,Donna!
Tom Haverford,That's not a treat!
Tom Haverford,Plain white socks?
Tom Haverford,"Man, did you buy anything for yourself today?"
Tom Haverford,Tell the truth?
Tom Haverford,That's hilarious.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"We tell him we had the perfect gift, but we were robbed at gunpoint."
Tom Haverford,"""Chris, he had a gun."""
Tom Haverford,"""He took all the gifts."""
Tom Haverford,"Now Chris feels bad, he's buying us gifts."
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know, Tommy's got a new watch."
Tom Haverford,To the future.
Tom Haverford,I'm a cashmere velvet candy cane.
Tom Haverford,"Velvet slippies, cashmere socks, velvet pants, cashmere turtle."
Tom Haverford,Treat yourself.
Tom Haverford,Donna Meagle?
Tom Haverford,"If you tell your friend, ""hey, meet me at Burberry,"" they gotta specify which one."
Tom Haverford,"There's a reflecting pool out back, there's an oldtimey train that runs through the mall, and three Burberrys."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to Nirvana, the Plaza at Eagleton."
Tom Haverford,But serious at the same time.
Tom Haverford,I'm kidding.
Tom Haverford,Can you grab me some of those pomegranate face masks too?
Tom Haverford,"There's chickenheads everywhere, Ben."
Tom Haverford,Chickenheads all around this mall.
Tom Haverford,"You're gonna find one, and you're gonna be great."
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,"Tick-tock, it's Tommy time!"
Tom Haverford,"This really attractive woman is my girlfriend, Lucy."
Tom Haverford,And it's finally happened.
Tom Haverford,It's always been a dream of mine to be a rug.
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, no."
Tom Haverford,Ron Corleone.
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,It's sushi and cigar club now.
Tom Haverford,I feel bad.
Tom Haverford,"Now the party, that's all about you, Boo."
Tom Haverford,You're trying to show people you have a good relationship with small businesses.
Tom Haverford,It's a small business.
Tom Haverford,Sounds cool so far.
Tom Haverford,Still sounds like it's about sex.
Tom Haverford,So you're saying you want me to choose a new font.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, that's too close."
Tom Haverford,Let's make him a number three.
Tom Haverford,That's literally the worst place I can imagine.
Tom Haverford,I'll use my legendary Haverford charm.
Tom Haverford,"The vans we rented to take senior citizens to the polls tomorrow are now, quote, ""no longer available."""
Tom Haverford,Hold on
Tom Haverford,You just talked to that person like I talk to you.
Tom Haverford,"Hold on, slow down."
Tom Haverford,You can't do that.
Tom Haverford,Andy's team wins.
Tom Haverford,Time.
Tom Haverford,"Mm, there's rules to this, sweet pea."
Tom Haverford,It's Donna's turn next.
Tom Haverford,Time.
Tom Haverford,"Now, are you a loose cannon or not?"
Tom Haverford,I'm good at this stuff.
Tom Haverford,You told me to make the most of my job.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you got to give people something to get excited about."
Tom Haverford,That was great.
Tom Haverford,"So what I'm thinking is I'll come back in a few days, you'll beg me again aah! So if it's okay with you guys, I would like to ask Ron for my job back."
Tom Haverford,"Ron May I have my job back, please? Thank you."
Tom Haverford,Who knows?
Tom Haverford,What's he gonna be in ten years? Snoop Laser Snake?
Tom Haverford,"Then when people got tired of that, he went by Snoop Dogg, and now he's Snoop Lion."
Tom Haverford,No one cared about Calvin Broadus until he started calling himself Snoop Doggy Dogg.
Tom Haverford,I mean we rebrand.
Tom Haverford,I will see you all Monday.
Tom Haverford,What if we just called it something else?
Tom Haverford,Everyone's scared of it.
Tom Haverford,"Look, Jamm's already ruined fluoride."
Tom Haverford,Too nothing.
Tom Haverford,"Go ahead, go!"
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's a forfeit."
Tom Haverford,Is that bacon on your turkey leg?
Tom Haverford,"It's the whine & cheese club, gorgeous."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Get at me.
Tom Haverford,"If you're not talking about you, you're talking about the wrong thing."
Tom Haverford,"I want you on message, and the message is Leslie Knope."
Tom Haverford,It was all so real.
Tom Haverford,Let's get out of here.
Tom Haverford,That's what I was born to do.
Tom Haverford,I'm a businessman.
Tom Haverford,It's hard doing stupid government stuff now that RentaSwag's closed.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, that box has my name on it."
Tom Haverford,Then I would tell you the puppy had a little side car with a piggy in it named Hampton.
Tom Haverford,Snakejuice!
Tom Haverford,"So my bar for ""stunning"" is pretty high."
Tom Haverford,This morning I saw a YouTube clip of a little puppy riding a motorcycle.
Tom Haverford,It's just a big dumb pond.
Tom Haverford,I thought these were destroyed by the FDA.
Tom Haverford,I love sports.
Tom Haverford,"Now, uh, let's go fetch this football throw, fellas."
Tom Haverford,That's your guys' job.
Tom Haverford,Tommy doesn't run.
Tom Haverford,"""Run""?"
Tom Haverford,"I got my Colts beanie, my Colts scarf, I got the Colts grill going, and the crowning glory Colts slippies."
Tom Haverford,Why so serious?
Tom Haverford,"One question, though."
Tom Haverford,"But, for now, why don't you let it out? Treat yourself to a good cry."
Tom Haverford,""" Then Blue Ivy Carter highfived me and gave me $40 million."
Tom Haverford,"Jean-Ralphio, stop crying."
Tom Haverford,Get over it.
Tom Haverford,Everyone loves me for it.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, if Ann needs Tylenol, she can get it herself."
Tom Haverford,"What she needs from you is to just look her in the eyes, nod your head, and say those two magic words."
Tom Haverford,I spent my entire life reading instructional books about relationships in order to trick women into liking me.
Tom Haverford,"When Ann tells you what's bothering her, don't try to fix it."
Tom Haverford,"Just say, ""Damn, that sucks."""
Tom Haverford,Come we have a problem.
Tom Haverford,I made up both those names.
Tom Haverford,"No, please."
Tom Haverford,"Well, which of his advisors does he trust more, Ted Flirtman or Rex Spax?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, really?"
Tom Haverford,Party starts at 7:00 in the historic Jermaine Jackson Ballroom at the Pawnee Supersuites.
Tom Haverford,"It is no longer ""A Pimps n' Hoes"" pajama party."
Tom Haverford,"Photos, BIOS, likes, dislikes, prescription medications."
Tom Haverford,That idea was nixed by a certain uptight nerd who shall remain nameless.
Tom Haverford,"By 10:00, we should know if Leslie won the election, but more importantly, tonight, Ann and I are getting back together."
Tom Haverford,"President of the chamber of commerce, Martin Kernston."
Tom Haverford,This is your primary target.
Tom Haverford,Last night at approximately 2:30 A.M.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I woke up from a dream that felt so real that it had to be a premonition.
Tom Haverford,"Me, Drake, and the Tmobile girl were playing baccarat on a private jet."
Tom Haverford,"Ann Perkins walks up to me, and she says, ""Tommy, tomorrow night, I'm taking you back."
Tom Haverford,I really am amazing.
Tom Haverford,I talk about myself constantly.
Tom Haverford,I'm on it.
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh.
Tom Haverford,"Whenever Ron has sex, the next morning, he comes in dressed like Tiger Woods."
Tom Haverford,Your team.
Tom Haverford,Number 50.
Tom Haverford,It's covered in a gallon of your boogers!
Tom Haverford,I'm not going to buy that thing.
Tom Haverford,He was double dribbling.
Tom Haverford,Gross!
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,That's a technical difficulty.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ann, how are you?"
Tom Haverford,Get out.
Tom Haverford,Who doesn't like a comeback story?
Tom Haverford,"All right, you wanna hear my plan, get at me later."
Tom Haverford,I gotta meet up with an old friend.
Tom Haverford,"All right, peace, man."
Tom Haverford,Let's go do this lunch thing.
Tom Haverford,Greg Phillips?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's see which one of these lucky visionaries is gonna make me rich."
Tom Haverford,"I told you before, Ronseph, I moved on to bigger things."
Tom Haverford,E720 going under was a blessing.
Tom Haverford,I'm tearing it up all over town like a boss.
Tom Haverford,"Look, if you ask me, Enron is down but not out."
Tom Haverford,This sucks!
Tom Haverford,We heard 100 pitches and they're all terrible.
Tom Haverford,Change of plans.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, that could work."
Tom Haverford,I'm just gonna have to go back to my same job that I've had forever.
Tom Haverford,This stinks!
Tom Haverford,"Blow that nose, playa!"
Tom Haverford,"Every time you pull one out, you get a little message to hype you up."
Tom Haverford,Talking Tissue!
Tom Haverford,"Well, no one else brought me any good business ideas, so I decided to take care of it myself."
Tom Haverford,Yep.
Tom Haverford,Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.
Tom Haverford,"Um ""Committees cover our democracy with blood."""
Tom Haverford,Which Mark?
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, no offense, I've heard a lot of bad ideas today, this is the worst."
Tom Haverford,Welcome to my laboratory.
Tom Haverford,And I am a party scientist.
Tom Haverford,It's a grand experiment.
Tom Haverford,"People have to be completely entertained from the moment they walk in, to the moment they leave."
Tom Haverford,It's an elusive idea.
Tom Haverford,The perfect party.
Tom Haverford,That's a foul!
Tom Haverford,Andy?
Tom Haverford,Ron?
Tom Haverford,"April, go!"
Tom Haverford,You guys are my idea factory.
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,"Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website."
Tom Haverford,Don't move around as much.
Tom Haverford,"So, that means Andy's team throws the ball from the stripey thing."
Tom Haverford,Give me the photo back.
Tom Haverford,What's going on?
Tom Haverford,Make the world's biggest pizza.
Tom Haverford,Foul!
Tom Haverford,We need the vans.
Tom Haverford,"Counteroffer, why don't you just do it for the story?"
Tom Haverford,"Ballpark me, how much would it cost?"
Tom Haverford,What if I give you five bucks to put a bag of poop in Saperstein's car?
Tom Haverford,"Mmm, that's an interesting idea, lawyer dude."
Tom Haverford,He had to send in his lackey.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Saperstein couldn't even face me himself?"
Tom Haverford,"""Turn note over."""
Tom Haverford,"""You still suck."""
Tom Haverford,"""Turn note over."""
Tom Haverford,"""You suck."""
Tom Haverford,"""Dear Tom, I win."""
Tom Haverford,"We need the vans, so please, give the vans, please?"
Tom Haverford,I start crying.
Tom Haverford,Leslie! We did it.
Tom Haverford,Ron's approved our committee.
Tom Haverford,Everybody heard me.
Tom Haverford,And what have you been doing for the last 43 years?
Tom Haverford,"If anybody actually showed up right now, the whole party would have been ruined."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, gentlemen."
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,Oh! This is a classic.
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Tom Haverford,"Fine, but after that, the pizza is our top priority."
Tom Haverford,"And if you are a grandpa, you're dead."
Tom Haverford,"Basically, if you're older than me, you're a grandpa."
Tom Haverford,"I could use your wise, grandfatherly advice."
Tom Haverford,"Come hear the ideas with me, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Now I'm going to let people come to me and invest my scrilla in the best idea I hear.
Tom Haverford,"For years, I've been coming up with my own ideas like some sort of non-rich idiot."
Tom Haverford,A horrible man recently gave me some great advice.
Tom Haverford,Glad you asked.
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,I'm basically a millionaire.
Tom Haverford,"Meanwhile, Tommy's riding high, 32,000 dollars."
Tom Haverford,"No, it's not, you boring grandpa."
Tom Haverford,This is a great shot.
Tom Haverford,That's awesome.
Tom Haverford,"And finally, Larry's share of the profit."
Tom Haverford,That's another good one.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Brendanawicz."
Tom Haverford,You gotta come check this out.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside."
Tom Haverford,And we have some awesome photos.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, she's fine."
Tom Haverford,The up-skirt photo.
Tom Haverford,It's time for the pregame coin toss.
Tom Haverford,Whatever.
Tom Haverford,You just merged your department with Parks and then made up your own title.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Tom Haverford,"That's really nice of you, man, for real."
Tom Haverford,I can't believe you called her for me.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, yeah! Uh, give me a minute."
Tom Haverford,Does anybody have any questions about permits?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, good to see you too."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Lucy, what are you doing here?"
Tom Haverford,I guess.
Tom Haverford,I mean David Beckham didn't show up.
Tom Haverford,But it's not perfect.
Tom Haverford,It's pretty great.
Tom Haverford,Ron!
Tom Haverford,"Ann, let me speak with you for a minute."
Tom Haverford,"Step up your vitamin C game, bro."
Tom Haverford,Tell your mama you love her.
Tom Haverford,"Someone's got the ""sniffies."""
Tom Haverford,"Yo, dawg, life is what you make of it! Leave while I'm ahead? You got it! Clear them sinuses, playboy."
Tom Haverford,Go for it.
Tom Haverford,Talking Tissue.
Tom Haverford,And while I've got you here
Tom Haverford,"The town could use more private sector money after the merger, so as Business Liaison, I would find companies looking to move or expand, and convince them to do it in Pawnee."
Tom Haverford,"April created a new position for herself, and I want to do the same."
Tom Haverford,You're looking at Pawnee's new Business Liaison.
Tom Haverford,"No, you can't do that!"
Tom Haverford,Because I have some huge news.
Tom Haverford,You saw that too.
Tom Haverford,Whoo.
Tom Haverford,"Look, I ain't gonna try to play a player."
Tom Haverford,You're trying to get beaucoup bucks just like the rest of us.
Tom Haverford,So how about this?
Tom Haverford,I have a business idea for a gourmet alcoholic yogurt.
Tom Haverford,I call it Yogurt platinum.
Tom Haverford,I'll let you in on the ground floor.
Tom Haverford,"And let me tell you, it's going to be worth way more than 10 grand."
Tom Haverford,Thank you guys so much for coming out.
Tom Haverford,"If you're too drunk to drive, please take one of our shuttles home."
Tom Haverford,Valet service will drop your car off later today.
Tom Haverford,"If you're one of our designated drivers, please take a ""thank you"" bag."
Tom Haverford,And enjoy the giant bows I put on your car.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,It's great seeing you.
Tom Haverford,"Are, uh, you sticking around for a bit, or"
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"After this is done, I'm gonna be broke, and I'm not gonna have a job."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, it was pretty great."
Tom Haverford,I I was really aiming for something
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,You saw that.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, call one."
Tom Haverford,It's more dramatic.
Tom Haverford,"So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right?"
Tom Haverford,Touchdown.
Tom Haverford,"No, that sounds great."
Tom Haverford,"Problem is, anything over 25 dollars I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me."
Tom Haverford,Match point.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Mr. Mayor."
Tom Haverford,That sounds good.
Tom Haverford,I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.
Tom Haverford,Bye.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, hello."
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's do this."
Tom Haverford,"Yep, we were just rapping about some things."
Tom Haverford,"Drum line, hit it!"
Tom Haverford,I think we've gotta take things to the next level.
Tom Haverford,Are you guys having a good time tonight?
Tom Haverford,"I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina."
Tom Haverford,I am what you might call a redneck.
Tom Haverford,"What's up, what's up?"
Tom Haverford,"They fit better, I got an employee discount, and the best part is no one can tell."
Tom Haverford,Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, they are, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Fill me up!
Tom Haverford,"I'm empty, yo!"
Tom Haverford,Et cetera.
Tom Haverford,Ron! That's how I enter rooms now.
Tom Haverford,"She's Cuban, she's got tattoos, and she's into me, which, as far as I'm concerned, is the sexiest quality a woman can have."
Tom Haverford,Big deal.
Tom Haverford,"And, this guy, is it pretty serious?"
Tom Haverford,Are you guys living together?
Tom Haverford,"Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you."
Tom Haverford,"You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken."
Tom Haverford,He's just weak.
Tom Haverford,You have to take care of him.
Tom Haverford,You probably feel like you need to move on.
Tom Haverford,"Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in"
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"God, no."
Tom Haverford,I'm not hitting on you.
Tom Haverford,I'm actually married.
Tom Haverford,"I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people."
Tom Haverford,"I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women."
Tom Haverford,I've spent a lot of time with them.
Tom Haverford,And I just-- I don't know.
Tom Haverford,I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.
Tom Haverford,Maybe we can just exchange numbers.
Tom Haverford,"You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this."
Tom Haverford,I'd love to do it.
Tom Haverford,He's gonna steal yogurt platinum.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, Ron Swanson is dating my exwife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,"My girlfriend, Lucy, is the sexiest woman in town."
Tom Haverford,Check it out.
Tom Haverford,Definitely.
Tom Haverford,One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up.
Tom Haverford,It's not your fault.
Tom Haverford,He totally baited you with that unpaid parking ticket.
Tom Haverford,"Plans on tearing the whole place down, just wants it for the land."
Tom Haverford,That guy's getting his financials together.
Tom Haverford,We have multiple bidders.
Tom Haverford,Good news.
Tom Haverford,Rontonamo Bay.
Tom Haverford,For what?
Tom Haverford,That's crazy.
Tom Haverford,I was born in South Carolina.
Tom Haverford,And I think we still have traction with those two.
Tom Haverford,"These colors don't run, baby."
Tom Haverford,We met in college.
Tom Haverford,"She wanted to work in the States, she couldn't get a permit--"
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Games aside, you gotta keep this between us."
Tom Haverford,"Don't tell anybody, please."
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,You bested me.
Tom Haverford,Is that all?
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,And I'm gonna vote for her.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,That's part of the charm of this whole place-- the cantankerous old coot who owns it.
Tom Haverford,It's authentic!
Tom Haverford,"And if Lil' Sebastian were still alive, he'd surely vote for her."
Tom Haverford,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am."
Tom Haverford,Just give me one second.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Donna."
Tom Haverford,Let me ask you something.
Tom Haverford,Do you hate black people?
Tom Haverford,"'Cause, apparently, in 1988, you donated money to the presidential campaign for David Duke."
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,How's it feel to lose so hard?
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, honey."
Tom Haverford,Let's get coffee.
Tom Haverford,Re Ron!
Tom Haverford,"You remember my wife, Wendy Haverford."
Tom Haverford,"We're celebrating, 'cause she's super rich and super hot also."
Tom Haverford,You're super hot.
Tom Haverford,Everybody else has to deal with it.
Tom Haverford,Let's get out of here.
Tom Haverford,"See you later, Ron."
Tom Haverford,You fouled.
Tom Haverford,You can't do anything.
Tom Haverford,"Did ya like it? It's pretty great, right? Worked really hard on it."
Tom Haverford,And I reckon you should too.
Tom Haverford,Her name is Leslie Knope.
Tom Haverford,Tommy Timberlake.
Tom Haverford,It never gets old.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Here's an anecdote Today I met the most boring man in the world.
Tom Haverford,His name was Gary.
Tom Haverford,Sorry I screwed up your campaign thing.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Tom Haverford,You're ejected.
Tom Haverford,That is my ex-wife.
Tom Haverford,"Keith, I had this job for four years."
Tom Haverford,"And I can tell you, you get out of it what you put into it."
Tom Haverford,What are you hoping to get out of it?
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,"God, it's so embarrassing."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,This is gonna sound weird.
Tom Haverford,I'm looking for a guy named Duke Silver.
Tom Haverford,And I failed again.
Tom Haverford,Tonight was my last chance to land a big client.
Tom Haverford,Let me give you a situation.
Tom Haverford,You're hosting a town hall meeting for local businesses.
Tom Haverford,We made some mistakes.
Tom Haverford,That was like one thing.
Tom Haverford,I didn't even get to the situation yet.
Tom Haverford,This evergreen scented candle should help put people in the mood to buy.
Tom Haverford,What are you going to do about it?
Tom Haverford,"Trees are sticky, and they got bugs in them."
Tom Haverford,I really wanted to do a good job.
Tom Haverford,And she has been a loyal patron of its businesses ever since.
Tom Haverford,"But then, a ray of hope Leslie Barbara Knope was born on January 18, 1975."
Tom Haverford,"Watergate, Vietnam, Peter Gabriel leaves Genesis."
Tom Haverford,Mark.
Tom Haverford,"You hate Ron, right?"
Tom Haverford,"So, we're on the same page."
Tom Haverford,You gotta help me take this guy down.
Tom Haverford,There's gotta be something on him.
Tom Haverford,It's not about the game anymore.
Tom Haverford,Ron has some serious dirt on me.
Tom Haverford,I need to balance things out.
Tom Haverford,"You must know how that feels, you got tons of dirt in your past."
Tom Haverford,"Please, you gotta help me."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, man."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna dig up so much dirt on this guy, there's gonna be worms all over the place."
Tom Haverford,It sounded snappier in my head.
Tom Haverford,It was a time of trouble.
Tom Haverford,The year was 1975.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford from the Knope campaign.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,It's back at the office.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Bill!"
Tom Haverford,I made you this amazing video biography.
Tom Haverford,"A fact is not an anecdote, Gary."
Tom Haverford,That's a foul for touching the basketball.
Tom Haverford,And that's why they call me Prince Charming.
Tom Haverford,And then we ran it back into the ground.
Tom Haverford,"Not an option, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,You're going down.
Tom Haverford,"No, no."
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, you are playing."
Tom Haverford,We're gonna nail you.
Tom Haverford,First it was Parks and Recreation.
Tom Haverford,Then Parks and Rec.
Tom Haverford,Then P&R.
Tom Haverford,Then lengthened it just a little bit to Tommy's place.
Tom Haverford,He actually once tossed me out of a club three years ago.
Tom Haverford,"What up, Keith?"
Tom Haverford,"We also hired ten huge, scary bouncers with earpieces."
Tom Haverford,Bengal Tiger.
Tom Haverford,"Jean-Ralphio, are there any animals on the guest list tonight?"
Tom Haverford,"And before you leave, don't forget your gift bag."
Tom Haverford,Want to make out? Go to our makeout room.
Tom Haverford,Got a head? Maybe you want a free fedora.
Tom Haverford,And stop asking questions.
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,"and special shrimp distributor, Indiana Pacers center, Roy Hibbert."
Tom Haverford,Shrimp wall.
Tom Haverford,Craps.
Tom Haverford,Juice is so chilled.
Tom Haverford,I bet anything I could find worse stuff on all you guys.
Tom Haverford,"and best of all, snake juice ice luge."
Tom Haverford,That's it.
Tom Haverford,Up top!
Tom Haverford,She one time made out with the water delivery guy in her office.
Tom Haverford,"On Halloween, she was dressed up as Batman."
Tom Haverford,Not Batgirl.
Tom Haverford,Batman.
Tom Haverford,And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside.
Tom Haverford,And it is my favorite thing in the world.
Tom Haverford,No one shows up to a good party on time.
Tom Haverford,The perfect party begins... Clink!
Tom Haverford,"Ballers and ballerettes, fasten your seatbelts."
Tom Haverford,Water under the bridge.
Tom Haverford,Are you insane?
Tom Haverford,He was a million year old racist!
Tom Haverford,I bet cave sex is insane.
Tom Haverford,Because of the echoes and the humidity.
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, Ron, but I created a legacy here, and I need to make sure it's protected."
Tom Haverford,Let's bring in some more people.
Tom Haverford,"In my four years here, I revolutionized the position of administrator and made this place cool."
Tom Haverford,I was the first person to abbreviate Parks and Recreation Department.
Tom Haverford,"Well, if you're squeaky clean, like I am, there's no problem."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but I've never sealed the deal."
Tom Haverford,Just window shopping.
Tom Haverford,"You can fly to Brazil, just don't enter the cave."
Tom Haverford,Am I right?
Tom Haverford,"I changed my name, which is legal, and once in high school, a girl beat me in a wrestling match."
Tom Haverford,"Every now and then we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, what you doing, guys?"
Tom Haverford,No point.
Tom Haverford,Foul on number three for taking a number two on number four.
Tom Haverford,Roughing the passer!
Tom Haverford,Double dribbling!
Tom Haverford,"By the way, I've been giving away free sports bras to the girls at Hot Dog on a Stick."
Tom Haverford,Suck it!
Tom Haverford,Jeremy!
Tom Haverford,That's a foul!
Tom Haverford,"Well, the real Cinderella didn't have hippo feet."
Tom Haverford,Because I always find the glass slipper for my Cinderella.
Tom Haverford,Dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly swag!
Tom Haverford,A party For the end of the world.
Tom Haverford,Made it the essence of everything we wanted the company to be.
Tom Haverford,"What if we took every dime we had left, threw one last party."
Tom Haverford,"We have this place for one more night, right?"
Tom Haverford,"Listen, we could play it safe, but that's not what E720 was about."
Tom Haverford,Remember the opening night party when you danced so hard with Tessa the receptionist that you broke one of your ribs.
Tom Haverford,You started out with 450000.
Tom Haverford,"So it looks like we'll each end up with about 5,000 dollars apiece."
Tom Haverford,My company is no better than a company where you ask a fake butler to Google things for you.
Tom Haverford,Blockbuster and askjeeves.
Tom Haverford,Along with pets.com
Tom Haverford,It's up in company heaven.
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 is dead.
Tom Haverford,He's just playing hardball.
Tom Haverford,Looking for dirt on me?
Tom Haverford,Let me tell you how it's gonna go down.
Tom Haverford,I called shotgun.
Tom Haverford,Give up now.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, wait, there's this."
Tom Haverford,"Everybody, I bought a Croissan'wich this morning."
Tom Haverford,This isn't even a real receipt.
Tom Haverford,Just a scrap of paper.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Where'd you get that photo from?
Tom Haverford,Those aren't Taliban robes.
Tom Haverford,"That's from Halloween, 10 years ago."
Tom Haverford,I was dressed like a Jedi.
Tom Haverford,"Well, did everybody know that Ron's ex-wife, Tammy, is actually his second ex-wife named Tammy?"
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,"Ron has two ex-wives, each named Tammy."
Tom Haverford,Can you afford that house?
Tom Haverford,You can't afford that house.
Tom Haverford,I can't even understand what you're saying right now.
Tom Haverford,I'ma be a mogul.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, who cares who they are? That's a massive bid."
Tom Haverford,"We have not one, but six open bars."
Tom Haverford,"No one's allowed in there, not even us."
Tom Haverford,And the Centurion Club elite VIP area.
Tom Haverford,There's also a double VIP area.
Tom Haverford,Welcome to E720's end of the world celebration.
Tom Haverford,"In a few minutes, we'll walk in there, we'll give him our demands, and then, bam!"
Tom Haverford,We had dinner last night and breakfast this morning.
Tom Haverford,I had to wait on my girlfriend to finish eating breakfast.
Tom Haverford,Sorry we're late.
Tom Haverford,"I was letting him win, dumbass."
Tom Haverford,"All right, no take-backs when we sober up, little partner."
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no, no."
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Tom Haverford,I thought we as a culture agreed to forget the year that everyone was into swing.
Tom Haverford,What!
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,"If you eclipse my flavor in any way, we'll have a problem."
Tom Haverford,"Before we get started, a quick announcement."
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,Set list?
Tom Haverford,"No, but I could."
Tom Haverford,You want to know why?
Tom Haverford,Every song I download has to pass a series of rigorous tests to answer one simple question: Is it a banger?
Tom Haverford,How many beats per minute?
Tom Haverford,How many drops?
Tom Haverford,How dope are the drops?
Tom Haverford,Were any acoustic instruments used?
Tom Haverford,"If so, it is not a banger."
Tom Haverford,I once accidentally downloaded a Lumineers song.
Tom Haverford,I had to throw away my whole computer just to be safe.
Tom Haverford,No need.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"When Eric saw this, he smashed a bunch of computers."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, let's move in together."
Tom Haverford,"Um, we'll just move on."
Tom Haverford,"""I was learning disabled and my mom cast a very long shadow."""
Tom Haverford,"And then I said, ""You know what?"
Tom Haverford,"""I think we need to get these bananas out of here."""
Tom Haverford,"Have a seat, boys."
Tom Haverford,"Actually, yes, Ben, I did."
Tom Haverford,"And my spa buddies own a couple of car dealerships in town, and they've agreed to donate a fleet of vehicles for Harvest Festival, twenty five vans for the entire event."
Tom Haverford,Mmmhmm.
Tom Haverford,"Your Pawnee business license has lapsed, which negates most of the deals you've made this year."
Tom Haverford,I'm guessing you're pretty bad at poker.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, first off, I need to know where you got these zebra-print pillows."
Tom Haverford,"Second of all, I got a Tin Cup Blu-Ray itching for a Rene Russo signature."
Tom Haverford,God! Can you just be cool for one second?
Tom Haverford,April.
Tom Haverford,"You dropped a ""Z"" in there?"
Tom Haverford,And we might even be able to pull it off under budget.
Tom Haverford,Take your time.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, it's not like we're trying to get work done here."
Tom Haverford,Ben! No! What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,"""Lateral, communal, zonal""?"
Tom Haverford,This is my dream.
Tom Haverford,Nostra-Thomas is happening.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Tom Haverford,Sometimes it's really hard to be friends with you.
Tom Haverford,Thank God we don't have to be seen together.
Tom Haverford,"Anyway, it is now my great honor to welcome to the stage the woman responsible for the entire Harvest Festival."
Tom Haverford,This is all the stuff we have to work with?
Tom Haverford,Where's everything I requested?
Tom Haverford,Where's my smoke machine?
Tom Haverford,Where's my girls dressed in Teddy Bear costumes?
Tom Haverford,Where's my Yeezus Mountain?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I have an idea."
Tom Haverford,Why don't you throw them in the garbage?
Tom Haverford,I was actually only at my prom for 15 minutes.
Tom Haverford,"By the time I got my Armani suit pressed and got the little dimple on my tie just right, it was 11:45 P.M."
Tom Haverford,"My date was pretty pissed, but, uh, I looked fly as hell."
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, Leslie Knope!"
Tom Haverford,"All right, not a 2 Chainz crowd."
Tom Haverford,I'll throw on some yeezy in a second.
Tom Haverford,Geezy?
Tom Haverford,Weezy?
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,You want some of that classic stuff.
Tom Haverford,"All right, I'll break you off some of that Ja Rule."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,How do you wha-- who's what?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, what's grizzledump?"
Tom Haverford,And why is trinking on it bad?
Tom Haverford,That sounds like a fun time.
Tom Haverford,We can fix that later.
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,Not anymore.
Tom Haverford,You're working with DJ Robo Drop.
Tom Haverford,"Badada, mm, mm, mm, mmmm"
Tom Haverford,Every Thursday night is ladies' night down at the Snakehole Lounge over on Burnham Avenue.
Tom Haverford,Ladies get two drinks for the price of one.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, that can't be right."
Tom Haverford,You have a lot to deal with.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to put this on your plate.
Tom Haverford,"Well, let me see if can turn him around."
Tom Haverford,"Although, you know, maybe those are just regular face tattoos."
Tom Haverford,I think he may have even been to jail.
Tom Haverford,And racist.
Tom Haverford,And unreliable.
Tom Haverford,That kind of thing.
Tom Haverford,"""Get me out here."""
Tom Haverford,"""Oh, I hate this place."""
Tom Haverford,Just a bad attitude.
Tom Haverford,This guy Eric is a disaster.
Tom Haverford,But there's one thing no man or machine can beat Tom Haverford at talking mad trash till I get what I want.
Tom Haverford,"Fast, fun and easy to use."
Tom Haverford,ERIC is an amazing program.
Tom Haverford,"1882, should a Presbyterian speak out of turn, he may be caned across the shinbone."
Tom Haverford,That's way too good of a deal.
Tom Haverford,That is what it says.
Tom Haverford,"Long shadow, go."
Tom Haverford,"Never thought I would say it, but I'm a genius for making you stay outside and do a menial task."
Tom Haverford,The only tent store this guy doesn't own is 300 miles away.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, Ann, you look stunning, but, Leslie, wow."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,"Ed, go first."
Tom Haverford,I forgot to tell you.
Tom Haverford,You can only fly five feet above the ground.
Tom Haverford,I bring a certain panache and spice to the spa experience for these guys.
Tom Haverford,"Before I joined, they were just three old white dudes quietly boiling in hot water."
Tom Haverford,Would you rather live in the pocket of a giant kangaroo or have a pocket on your own stomach that has a tiny kangaroo in it all the time?
Tom Haverford,Preston.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, Larry."
Tom Haverford,Your tuna fish sandwich stunk up my suit.
Tom Haverford,Irrelevant.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,Stay out here and double-check these deal memos.
Tom Haverford,"If you get through 'em, triple-check 'em."
Tom Haverford,Just don't come inside.
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, Pawnee business liaison."
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,So I guess this is not a straightforward deal.
Tom Haverford,"Forgot to mention, the tiny kangaroo is a racist."
Tom Haverford,Right this way.
Tom Haverford,We can definitely get you sorted.
Tom Haverford,Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?
Tom Haverford,Not with this spot-on British accent.
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Tom Haverford,Why'd you invite Larry?
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, April."
Tom Haverford,"And, hey, bonus, it's pretty close to city hall."
Tom Haverford,You guys are gonna be regulars.
Tom Haverford,I'll keep a table open for you.
Tom Haverford,You think she'd marry me?
Tom Haverford,April.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, okay, okay."
Tom Haverford,What should I do?
Tom Haverford,"She's so out of my league, my brain just made me talk that way so I'd seem cooler."
Tom Haverford,I just panicked.

Tom Haverford,I'm gonna check if this gas station has some biore strips.
Tom Haverford,"Aw, man, did I miss a Larry fart?"
Tom Haverford,Smells like a hippopotamus took a dump on a skunk.
Tom Haverford,Thank you very much.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm calling Tent Emporium right now."
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,"Then, I think what we want to do at that point is start getting the energy up."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"So, maybe you start off with something like that."
Tom Haverford,"""I have no clue what I'm doing."""

Tom Haverford,I sort of run the whole department.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yes, I'm Thomas Haverford."
Tom Haverford,Smashing.
Tom Haverford,Right.
Tom Haverford,Did Tom Ford turn around the House of Gucci?
Tom Haverford,Excuse me?
Tom Haverford,An online dating site randomly paired us up.

Tom Haverford,And then you kissed me as a joke To shut me up.
Tom Haverford,An unfolding charge?
Tom Haverford,A noise damage waiver?
Tom Haverford,How can noise damage tents?
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait."
Tom Haverford,Let me try one more thing.
Tom Haverford,What's the price now?
Tom Haverford,"Does have an effect, though."

Tom Haverford,"Yes, sorry."
Tom Haverford,I do now.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, I've been taking pictures of you all day for my new Facebook album: ""Ron Swan: Gettin' off the grid."""

Tom Haverford,"So, Joan, how is married life treating you?"
Tom Haverford,What about us?
Tom Haverford,I saw you guys getting back together.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe the fact that we just broke up, and you're already riding the Traeger train."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, I don't know."
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,"You own a restaurant, too?"
Tom Haverford,That was my idea.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, don't act like you don't know the word ""thing."""
Tom Haverford,I think I should drive you to the hospital.
Tom Haverford,Why are you doing this to us?
Tom Haverford,It's a game of cat and mouse.
Tom Haverford,She wants what she can't have.
Tom Haverford,Joan's a married woman.
Tom Haverford,This is in the bag.
Tom Haverford,Don't worry.
Tom Haverford,I've got to go talk to Xander before Terrence gets to him.
Tom Haverford,Cover me.
Tom Haverford,Xander.
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,"Tom's Bistro is going to be the dopest, quite possibly trillest restaurant in the area."
Tom Haverford,What do you say?
Tom Haverford,"Look, man, you know your stuff, but you're like a crazy volcano."
Tom Haverford,Where are we going now?
Tom Haverford,You'd have to show me you can bring it down a notch.
Tom Haverford,"Now, we need that picture, for privacy reasons."
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,A disappointingly good idea from Jerry.
Tom Haverford,"For my item, I chose a picture of my exgirlfriend Lucy with a mustache drawn on her face and stink lines coming off her, 'cause she stinks."
Tom Haverford,That's a weird way to describe me.
Tom Haverford,She broke up with me.

Tom Haverford,Game recognize game.
Tom Haverford,Respect.
Tom Haverford,I brought some Entertainment 720 pillowcases for your pillow.

Tom Haverford,I should just close my account.
Tom Haverford,I can't beat him.
Tom Haverford,He's awesome.
Tom Haverford,He kills me.
Tom Haverford,He beats me every time.
Tom Haverford,Behold!
Tom Haverford,My latest attempt to drag this department into the 20th century.
Tom Haverford,"I play a lot of online Scrabble with my boss, Ron Swanson, and, oh, my God, that guy is the best."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,I'd settle for getting you into the 20th.
Tom Haverford,"I fed all of Leslie's emails, letters, and memos into a program and generated A word cloud."
Tom Haverford,This is how we can get gift ideas.
Tom Haverford,"I'm trying, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,But Joan got an anonymous tip that there's a factual inaccuracy in your book.
Tom Haverford,"Don't leave the grid, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"It was a JJ's Diner record, and you took his picture."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"I'm having fish, so maybe a full-bodied red?"
Tom Haverford,He seems to be keeping it together.
Tom Haverford,Thanks very much.
Tom Haverford,I think I may have found my new sommelier.
Tom Haverford,We'll have to make sure the wine cellar at Tom's Bistro is soundproof.
Tom Haverford,"Isn't there a photo of you up at JJ's Diner, from that time when you aah!"
Tom Haverford,"Ben, I'm cute together with everybody."
Tom Haverford,Ooh!
Tom Haverford,Am I gonna be happy?
Tom Haverford,"Now, about Leslie's book."
Tom Haverford,"Behind every successful man Is me, smiling and taking partial credit."
Tom Haverford,"At the risk of bragging, one of the things I'm best at is riding coattails."
Tom Haverford,"But it'll also help my company, Entertainment 720."
Tom Haverford,I'm tryin' to find the words to describe this girl without bein' disrespectful Getting the book into Joan's book club will really help Leslie.
Tom Haverford,"I think she wants one of her big ""gotcha"" moments."
Tom Haverford,She won't tell me.
Tom Haverford,"But Bobby Newport is super handsome and charming, so that means people will probably vote for him because there's no justice in the world."
Tom Haverford,"No grid, no grid, no grid, no grid."
Tom Haverford,"Grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid"
Tom Haverford,"If anything, you need to get more on the grid."
Tom Haverford,The grid is the best.
Tom Haverford,"And if you're off the grid, how are you gonna post photos of the dope food at restaurants you're at and all the cool places you're stuntin' in?"
Tom Haverford,"Maybe we can get that book club sticker in order, and we can work on unlocking that peacock cage."
Tom Haverford,"You gotta help me, man."
Tom Haverford,"No, this is way different."
Tom Haverford,Guess there's no Tom Haverford equivalent.
Tom Haverford,"Joan, we left you some water and aspirin by the bed!"
Tom Haverford,Ah!
Tom Haverford,My life is over.
Tom Haverford,I'm officially old and uncool.
Tom Haverford,Might as well start wearing a plaid shirt and a tie and khakis and whatever shoes you're wearing.
Tom Haverford,I guess that's true.
Tom Haverford,Richard Branson and Mark Cuban are too busy making deals to keep up with what the kids are into.
Tom Haverford,How else do you explain their terrible haircuts?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,You're old as [bleep].
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ben."
Tom Haverford,One second.
Tom Haverford,I just wanna see how soft these sheets are.
Tom Haverford,"Say what you will about Joan, but she knows how to decorate a bedroom."
Tom Haverford,"Let's go, bro."
Tom Haverford,Three.
Tom Haverford,Two.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa."
Tom Haverford,We gotta make sure she gets home safe.
Tom Haverford,she's a disaster.
Tom Haverford,"Not surprised, I'm one of a kind, just like the custom Nikes I designed that say ""Tommy's Tootsies"" across the toes."
Tom Haverford,"It's not about the business anymore, man."
Tom Haverford,Bye!
Tom Haverford,This can't be happening.
Tom Haverford,Thanks so much for having Leslie back on the program.
Tom Haverford,Joan.
Tom Haverford,Bribing someone to hide a sexcapade I'm proud to call you a friend.
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 was unable to get the sticker for Leslie's book.
Tom Haverford,"Bad news, team."
Tom Haverford,How did he notice these?
Tom Haverford,But scheduling's the main part of my job.
Tom Haverford,ERIC is a computer program?
Tom Haverford,You must be Eric.
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,"You are gonna oversee the Popsicle eating contest, the slip'n slideathon, the watermelon carving, the gazpacho off, and star in a one woman show about parks rules and regulations?"
Tom Haverford,I'm practicing.
Tom Haverford,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna get you one of these days.
Tom Haverford,Probably just ruin the moment with something lame.
Tom Haverford,"Look out, man."
Tom Haverford,Go ahead.
Tom Haverford,Play whatever you want.
Tom Haverford,Can't be any worse than this.
Tom Haverford,You actually like this?
Tom Haverford,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Tom Haverford,Larry.
Tom Haverford,But it's not even auto-tuned.
Tom Haverford,"No, why?"
Tom Haverford,"What's grizzledump, Ben?"
Tom Haverford,We gotta get her home.
Tom Haverford,Talk about that for a little bit.
Tom Haverford,You're already doing it.
Tom Haverford,I begged you.
Tom Haverford,Vote for me to be your boyfriend.
Tom Haverford,Please.
Tom Haverford,But I'd do anything to get back together with you.
Tom Haverford,"I just act that way sometimes Because I'm nervous, and I feel like you're out of my league."
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,Be incredibly boring.
Tom Haverford,Just like that.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, that's perfect."
Tom Haverford,Start talking about nerd stuff.
Tom Haverford,You've gotta throw some cold water on this situation.
Tom Haverford,"Xander, my mander."
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Owner, operator, and global ambassador for Tom's Bistro, opening this spring in Pawnee."
Tom Haverford,My main target for Tom's Bistro?
Tom Haverford,Xander Truffant.
Tom Haverford,He's the best young somm in the game.
Tom Haverford,I don't say this lightly.
Tom Haverford,He's basically the Bruno Mars of Indiana amateur wine tasting.
Tom Haverford,That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
Tom Haverford,"She had, like, five bottles of alcohol, she's calling me ""caramel."""
Tom Haverford,She's not married anymore.
Tom Haverford,"Please, I beg you, don't embarrass me."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait, wait."
Tom Haverford,"When we get to the vineyard, there'll be a lot of fancy people there."

Tom Haverford,You like Star Trek.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ben."
Tom Haverford,Ah.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,"A cell phone belt clip? No, Ron."
Tom Haverford,You're destroying me.
Tom Haverford,"Ew, gross, it has ""buttons."""
Tom Haverford,"I think it's just the original phone, period."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,That guy Hashish at City Planning?
Tom Haverford,Who do you think's got me beat?
Tom Haverford,Do you think I'm in the top five best looking Indian guys in Pawnee?
Tom Haverford,"April, let me ask you something."
Tom Haverford,"Today at a local vineyard, a bunch of sommeliers, AKA wine experts, are going to be competing for their certification."
Tom Haverford,I'm going to hire the best one at my new restaurant.
Tom Haverford,Tom's Bistro.
Tom Haverford,People that convince other people to buy expensive stuff they don't need.
Tom Haverford,Those are the real heroes.
Tom Haverford,Donna.
Tom Haverford,April.
Tom Haverford,Wine Country train is leaving the station.
Tom Haverford,You ready?
Tom Haverford,I didn't invite any of you.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, grandpas."
Tom Haverford,"You know, I think you're right."
Tom Haverford,"I like it, butâ¦ seems a little small."
Tom Haverford,Does it have one helipad? I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"And you know what else? I'm coming for you, girl Just Like You Want."
Tom Haverford,I'll take it.
Tom Haverford,Does that mean we're getting back together?
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no."
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."

Tom Haverford,"Man, that was so much fun."
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Tom Haverford,He looks sad.
Tom Haverford,You told us to make a memory.
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ann, this is on you."
Tom Haverford,Is he sad?
Tom Haverford,You like the color orange? Carrots? You into those?
Tom Haverford,The fact that I haven't even gotten close to cheating on her is a disappointment to both of us.
Tom Haverford,But my wife understands that a good politician has to be appealing to the ladies.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I'm married."
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,The worst thing you can do with an important presentation like this is overprepare.
Tom Haverford,"This is your chance to put your names on the Pawnee unity concert, the biggest event of 2014 besides the unveiling of Tricia's new highlights."
Tom Haverford,There's your money back.
Tom Haverford,Leslie Knope is scrappy like a terrier.
Tom Haverford,She's smooth like a blended whiskey.
Tom Haverford,"My girl has big ideas and big feelings, and she's not afraid to express them."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, can you put some more tiny marshmallow in my hot chocky?"
Tom Haverford,"I don't know what to do I could take the offer and break even, but I've come so far."
Tom Haverford,Great.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,She's sick.
Tom Haverford,"That's why I'm wearing this, and misting myself with hand sanitizer."

Tom Haverford,I just took four Benadryls to dull my sensitivity.
Tom Haverford,I'm in my sexy pajamas.
Tom Haverford,Lucy is here.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing here?
Tom Haverford,"No matter what happens, you will never acquire my thinking PJs or my YouTube blazer... Nonnegotiable."
Tom Haverford,Listen to me very carefully.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I've heard all the facts, and it's pretty obvious what I have to do-- Get a big old mug of hot chocolate, put on my thinking PJs, and get back to you."
Tom Haverford,You have a gift.
Tom Haverford,The world needs you.
Tom Haverford,"And I was like, ""Jaden, be serious."""
Tom Haverford,"Yesterday Jaden Smith came in, and he was like, ""Look, I want to quit the music/acting business and work here with you."""

Tom Haverford,I'm gonna do what I do best-- lock down deals.
Tom Haverford,"Come with me, I need your help."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I got to go.
Tom Haverford,Put my sammie in the fridge.
Tom Haverford,"That way, I never disappoint her."
Tom Haverford,I try to be considerate.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I am off for a soak and a schvitz."
Tom Haverford,Arrivederch.
Tom Haverford,You're my hero.
Tom Haverford,You're the king.
Tom Haverford,"If there was a Tellenson Award for hooking up with trashy chicks all the time, you'd have several of those awards."
Tom Haverford,"I've seen you hook up with more trashy chicks in the last year than I can count, all right?"
Tom Haverford,"I need you back there, man."
Tom Haverford,And that's making them lose interest in me.
Tom Haverford,"Becky and Stacy are both really into you, and you're blowing it with them."
Tom Haverford,What is your problem?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, how about this one Lasik for fingernails?"
Tom Haverford,"Cut your fingernails once, never have to cut 'em again."
Tom Haverford,All we need is a complicated laser I have no idea how to build.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh!
Tom Haverford,"""Saltweens."""
Tom Haverford,Saltines for tweens.
Tom Haverford,"If all goes well, this may be one of the last times I ever have to speak to you."
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh?
Tom Haverford,"Soon I'll have a new career, new crib, new friends."
Tom Haverford,I'll see you then.
Tom Haverford,And dorkasaurus over here is gonna handle the boring stuff.
Tom Haverford,"So, I think it's best if I go to the spa."
Tom Haverford,"No, Ben."
Tom Haverford,Two pathetic guys eating pathetic sandwiches.
Tom Haverford,Sounds terrific.
Tom Haverford,I guess I'm Jerry now.
Tom Haverford,"After work, I'll just go home, straight to my boring house, kiss my wife, and have a homecooked meal with my three beautiful daughters."
Tom Haverford,What a miserable life.
Tom Haverford,You promised Leslie.
Tom Haverford,"See, I never promise Leslie anything."
Tom Haverford,No punchies!
Tom Haverford,"I know conversations like this are hard for you 'cause you still have feelings for me, but you'll land on your feet, kid."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ann."

Tom Haverford,Scientists say the emotions of love and hate are very close to each other.
Tom Haverford,I got to give Nadia something awesome so she'll remember me when she's in Africa.
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I need that bear."
Tom Haverford,Savner Bleaches and Chemicals!

Tom Haverford,I may have a few eggs ready to hatch in the personal idea nest.
Tom Haverford,Perfect!
Tom Haverford,"It's all happening, Ben."
Tom Haverford,Bloosh is a weekly lifestyle email written by Annabel Porter.
Tom Haverford,She used to be the face of the Eagleton phone book.
Tom Haverford,Then she moved to Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming friends with a bunch of celebrities.
Tom Haverford,Go home.
Tom Haverford,"Those are all for me, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,It's the one day a year I allow myself to be selfish.
Tom Haverford,"My Nubian princess, this is our holy day."
Tom Haverford,There's no way Ben can slow down enough to keep up with us.
Tom Haverford,"Donna, you and I are relaxation professionals."
Tom Haverford,He doesn't know how to relax.
Tom Haverford,Exactly.

Tom Haverford,But coming this spring to the style network Ranger Reality Show.
Tom Haverford,The best day of the year .

Tom Haverford,We're gonna be here forever.
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."

Tom Haverford,"Now, I guarantee you, anyone that sees this logo is not gonna ""fugghedaboudit."""
Tom Haverford,This is our current community center.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,This is our new community center!
Tom Haverford,"That's right, it looks like an apple store."
Tom Haverford,"Today, I'm a Beverly hills plastic surgeon, and the Parks department is a wrinkly old housewife in her early 30s."
Tom Haverford,I'm about to work a miracle.
Tom Haverford,"Listen to me, Bento box, the point of this is to pamper yourself."
Tom Haverford,"When you talk me up, be sure to mention that you really admire how I take big risks with men's neck accessories."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Ron, Annabels coming over."
Tom Haverford,I knew you wouldn't get it.
Tom Haverford,"Don't be upset, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,No one listens to the radio.
Tom Haverford,I wasn't even listening.
Tom Haverford,I was listening to podcasts.
Tom Haverford,Podcasts are great.
Tom Haverford,Radio is boring.
Tom Haverford,Are we sure we should do this?
Tom Haverford,"Last time we scared an old person, Larry had a heart attack."
Tom Haverford,Treat yourself 2011.
Tom Haverford,The only business idea I have that's even remotely fleshed out is a restaurant.

Tom Haverford,Did you call that P.R. guy?
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ron, baby, what are the hot deets on Bloosh?"

Tom Haverford,Worse.
Tom Haverford,That's worse.
Tom Haverford,"Hold up, sweet pea."
Tom Haverford,We have an idea.
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh!
Tom Haverford,It's called the Unity Concert.
Tom Haverford,It's a massive music and arts festival to celebrate the merger.
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh!
Tom Haverford,Donna said she might be able to get Ginuwine.
Tom Haverford,That's given me a reason to live.
Tom Haverford,We did it!
Tom Haverford,"Congratulations, Ron!"
Tom Haverford,"And now that you got in, I can get in too."
Tom Haverford,I've been trying to get RentaSwag in Bloosh for months.
Tom Haverford,What do you think?
Tom Haverford,"""A Ron Swanson designed chair is the musthave item of the season, along with red quinoa, wind therapy, and buying an island."""
Tom Haverford,She spent four months living in Kate Bosworth's pool house.
Tom Haverford,She's legit.
Tom Haverford,Then she moved back to become a lifestyle guru.
Tom Haverford,What's the latest news?
Tom Haverford,I'm a dreamer.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, you said if there was something you could do to help me, you would."
Tom Haverford,You have to go and take me so I can meet her.

Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,You're sick.
Tom Haverford,You're not coming in.
Tom Haverford,"Donna, barricade the door now."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I know highend, Internet only lifestyle magazine really isn't your scene, so Donna and I wrote up some cocktail banter and some conversation snippets for you to practice so you can fit in."
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Please?
Tom Haverford,Getting in Bloosh is my last chance to save my store.
Tom Haverford,"I can't believe an angel investor floated down from the heavens, and I don't even have anything to pitch him."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, you must've had one good business idea."
Tom Haverford,You're 52 years old!
Tom Haverford,She was probably cheating.
Tom Haverford,"And if five years ago, you told me I was gonna be in this ballroom with Marlene Griggs-Knope, I would've guessed we were getting married."
Tom Haverford,My name is Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Hello, Pawnee government!"
Tom Haverford,You're the word king.

Tom Haverford,Do you like tamales?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll bring a picnic lunch.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I can drive you around and we'll pick another one?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, no, there was a mistake, and we gave the park to someone else."
Tom Haverford,She's the one.
Tom Haverford,What did you name your imaginary airline?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm just gonna man up, tell her how I feel, and hope she feels the same way about me, and that's that."
Tom Haverford,What should I do?
Tom Haverford,"If she doesn't, no big deal."
Tom Haverford,I'm an adult.
Tom Haverford,How much?
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,That's way more that I can afford.
Tom Haverford,It's not a big deal.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, when it first launches I'll go back and forth, but hopefully it takes off and it'll become a full-time job."
Tom Haverford,We're gonna be late.
Tom Haverford,Let's bounce.
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz.
Tom Haverford,"Now, the words ""too sexy"" aren't really in my vocabulary, but, Marlene, girl, you are too sexy!"
Tom Haverford,I'm serious!
Tom Haverford,Come on!
Tom Haverford,"Yes, please."
Tom Haverford,V-O-G-X Was that right? No.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Now, April has something she'd like to admit."
Tom Haverford,I have reserved the park for your event.
Tom Haverford,Nadia! We're very sorry for everything you went through today.
Tom Haverford,"I'll tell her I had to cover for you, because you are so dumb."
Tom Haverford,Tell her all the screw-ups were your fault.
Tom Haverford,New plan.
Tom Haverford,"Nope, I can't do it."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,Let's do it.
Tom Haverford,It's done.
Tom Haverford,This place is perfect.
Tom Haverford,I can only stall for so long.
Tom Haverford,Pretty rough.
Tom Haverford,I'd love to come by and maybe help administer vaccines?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, when is the thing you're doing in the park?"
Tom Haverford,April's gonna file these.
Tom Haverford,Great.
Tom Haverford,You filled 'em out.
Tom Haverford,"So, those are the forms."
Tom Haverford,Best way to prevent crow's neck.
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's all there is to that story, so no need for any more questions."
Tom Haverford,"I think that may have affected my voice, like, in certain British ways."
Tom Haverford,"You know, I had a cold recently."
Tom Haverford,Huh.
Tom Haverford,It's gone.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Nadia, I didn't know what you wanted, so I got you a cappuccino, a latte, four bags of coffee beans, and a mini espresso machine."
Tom Haverford,There she is.
Tom Haverford,"What, what, what?"
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Tom Haverford,Things used to make me so happy.
Tom Haverford,But I've grown a lot in the last year.
Tom Haverford,"Now I just want one big thing, my own restaurant, named after me, that makes me so much money I can buy anything I want."
Tom Haverford,I should go.
Tom Haverford,"Man, the places that came on the market today are way nicer than the listings we saw yesterday."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"I changed five times, and she hasn't noticed yet."
Tom Haverford,"I am in love with Nadia Whatever her last name is, and I'm gonna keep her here, using the most powerful weapon I have-- bureaucratic incompetence."
Tom Haverford,You filled out Form 3208.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I guess I could fix the roof and tear up the counters."
Tom Haverford,Do something about the smell.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, what happened?"
Tom Haverford,I thought Jurassic Fork was super popular.
Tom Haverford,I think you may have misunderstood what people liked about Jurassic Fork.
Tom Haverford,I actually think the space is pretty cool.
Tom Haverford,"Obviously, we'd had to move this T-Rex, but--"
Tom Haverford,This is really the last place you have available?
Tom Haverford,Dang.
Tom Haverford,Maybe Tom's Bistro wasn't meant to be.
Tom Haverford,What the hell are you guys doing?
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"I like to have music on while I work, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"I guess we gotta, like, make Daiquiris now."
Tom Haverford,"Someone left out a blender, fresh fruits, and rum?"
Tom Haverford,Weird.
Tom Haverford,Huh.
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna do?
Tom Haverford,"Bureaucracy, right?"
Tom Haverford,I just got excited about the restaurant but I should probably call my investor and tell him we have a problem.
Tom Haverford,Cologne for watches.
Tom Haverford,You were supposed to fill out Form 3248.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"That's where the politicians will sit, this is where the connected guys will bring their goomahs."
Tom Haverford,I love it!
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, buddy."
Tom Haverford,I'll be back.
Tom Haverford,"So, the girls will be like, ""Hey, what's with that hat?"" I'm gonna go peacock it out."
Tom Haverford,"Basically, I'm wearing something that kind of makes me stand out, like a peacock."
Tom Haverford,It's called peacocking.
Tom Haverford,Ladies don't stand a chance.
Tom Haverford,"I'm more in your face, but in a fun way."
Tom Haverford,He's laid back.
Tom Haverford,"He's handsome, I'm a cutie pie."
Tom Haverford,You know?
Tom Haverford,Always thought we'd make a great team.
Tom Haverford,I've been dying to go out with Mark.
Tom Haverford,Mitch!
Tom Haverford,Thanks for meeting me.
Tom Haverford,"I've got two words for you-- ""Tom's Bistro,"" an old-fashioned, old-world Italian restaurant."
Tom Haverford,"Classy, authentic ambience in a small-town setting."
Tom Haverford,Ben! You brought the wrong easel.
Tom Haverford,God! Can't take this guy anywhere.
Tom Haverford,Let me paint you a picture.
Tom Haverford,"Man, that dude has stuck it in some crazy chicks."
Tom Haverford,"Tom's Bistro will have all the classic elements, but with modern twists-- an oak bar, live music, and Sunday brunch with scrambled eggs so fluffy they'll be like little pillows for your bacon."
Tom Haverford,Amazing!
Tom Haverford,You know snitches get stitches.
Tom Haverford,"He shared some words of wisdom with me today, and while he was yammering on about whatever, I happened to see his old ID card."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're a doctor."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, but most of the credit goes to my number-four, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,What is it?
Tom Haverford,Wow!
Tom Haverford,"You're right, man."
Tom Haverford,That is not sexy.
Tom Haverford,Dude.
Tom Haverford,I'll be right back.
Tom Haverford,Look at these guys! The key-forgetting twins!
Tom Haverford,"Ben, stop!"
Tom Haverford,This is so boring!
Tom Haverford,This is like listening to a TED talk by the color beige.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I sold tons of awesome stuff."
Tom Haverford,Guess it makes sense my next challenge is to sell something mind-numbingly dull.
Tom Haverford,Ahhhh.
Tom Haverford,That must be fun.
Tom Haverford,"Stacy, Becky tells me that you two are both real estate agents."
Tom Haverford,"And if I know anything about Rwanda, and I don't, I bet it's full of rich guys who'll buy her whatever she wants."
Tom Haverford,That bear was the only thing she was gonna have to remember me by in Rwanda.
Tom Haverford,"I could get you, uh, a ninja turtle balloon or Cliffhanger on VHS."
Tom Haverford,"I still got some tickets, though."
Tom Haverford,"So we take the old logo from the 1970s, and we make limited edition hats, posters, tshirts, everything."
Tom Haverford,"I've been playing skee ball for, like, two hours trying to win that for Nadia."
Tom Haverford,What are you doing with my bear?
Tom Haverford,Perkins!
Tom Haverford,"People love limited editions, plus parents will get swept up in the nostalgia and want to go to the parks to recreate the fun they had growing up."
Tom Haverford,"Look at it, I can picture it now."
Tom Haverford,You're supposed to be my lookout.
Tom Haverford,"All right, you're gonna be my lookout for a second."
Tom Haverford,"Nadia, the super hot doctor, has been hanging out with me for the last week."
Tom Haverford,I had to pull my pants all the way to the ground like a toddler.
Tom Haverford,I actually just went.
Tom Haverford,You look wiggidy wiggidy wiggidy wiggidy wonderful.
Tom Haverford,No problem.
Tom Haverford,"Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds?"
Tom Haverford,My favorite realtor.
Tom Haverford,You got some hot properties to show me?
Tom Haverford,"Remember my list of must haves: Open kitchen, fireplace, exposed brick, and you know I wouldn't kick a skylight out of bed."
Tom Haverford,"I'm opening Pawnee's first authentic Sinatra style Italian restaurant ""Tom's Bistro."""
Tom Haverford,"I'm kind of like a skinny, handsome, Indian Mario Batali who doesn't know how to cook."
Tom Haverford,"Before we go, I got you guys a little something for helping me out."
Tom Haverford,"Let's do this, Mark."
Tom Haverford,For real?
Tom Haverford,You'd hit on chicks?
Tom Haverford,"Come on, now, you promised we'd go hit on chicks."
Tom Haverford,"There's not gonna be a later, Mark."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, it's 9:30, on a Friday night in Pawnee."
Tom Haverford,"Bounce, bounce, bounce."
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Scully's Bar.
Tom Haverford,Ladies.
Tom Haverford,This is great.
Tom Haverford,She's definitely out of my league.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"Actually, we're not even playing the same sport."
Tom Haverford,I can't believe we met just before you have to go on your stupid vacation.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, brother."
Tom Haverford,"40,000?"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, how many tickets for that bear, again?"
Tom Haverford,Understood.
Tom Haverford,"Pretty good, except I suck at skee ball."
Tom Haverford,So she's available.
Tom Haverford,Whoa! You nailed Malwae-Tweep? Nice.
Tom Haverford,"I know, and I'm sorry."
Tom Haverford,"But Mitch asked me what I was passionate about, and honestly I'm never gonna be passionate about dry cleaning chemicals."
Tom Haverford,"I know opening a restaurant is risky, but I can make this work."
Tom Haverford,I know I can!
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, man."
Tom Haverford,"I know this is a symbolic gesture, but my investor floor is $1,000."
Tom Haverford,"So as of now, you own zero shares."
Tom Haverford,Yep!
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Yet another professional Indian skee ball player?
Tom Haverford,I didn't want to be a cliche.
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,I'm a skee ball master.
Tom Haverford,No problem.
Tom Haverford,That's a stupid vacation.
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,It's kind of like she's in NBA and I work at a muffler store next to the stadium.
Tom Haverford,We have ten tables booked for the soft opening.
Tom Haverford,Ron does this weird thing where he says exactly what he means.
Tom Haverford,"How's it looking, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I don't want to do that."
Tom Haverford,Nothing is off limits.
Tom Haverford,She's still walking.
Tom Haverford,"If you want another date, keep walking away."
Tom Haverford,What about our next date?
Tom Haverford,You have to answer.
Tom Haverford,"This is a deposition style hearing, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,"Now, how many sexual partners have you had in the last year?"
Tom Haverford,"I've been a baller since birth, son."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I'm an athlete."
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,You little chumps wanna play some ball?
Tom Haverford,Let's do this.
Tom Haverford,Watch out.
Tom Haverford,Nothin' but net.
Tom Haverford,Tommy from half court.
Tom Haverford,"Mark, that's great."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,"Perd, it's going to be amazing."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, Miss Knope, you're accused of stealing wine."
Tom Haverford,"How many drinks do you have per week, on average?"
Tom Haverford,It's because I'm miserable.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,How many sexual partners have you had in the last year?
Tom Haverford,Big fan.
Tom Haverford,This isn't working.
Tom Haverford,"What up, Perd?"
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna write down 10.
Tom Haverford,Do you ever cheat on your taxes?
Tom Haverford,Good.
Tom Haverford,You're doing great.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to do this.
Tom Haverford,My screen!
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,There is a girl here that also works at Quiznos.
Tom Haverford,"Ann, you look miserable!"
Tom Haverford,"Please, stop it!"
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Tom Haverford,"Stop the song, stop the song right now!"
Tom Haverford,Including dreams.
Tom Haverford,"She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos."
Tom Haverford,"Have you ever had a sexual dream about our boss, Ron Swanson?"
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Terrible!
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ann."
Tom Haverford,"Now, in this recurring dream that you have about Ron, is he like a regular Ron, or is he half Ron, half animal, like a centaur?"
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but once you go in there, you will see things you cannot unsee."
Tom Haverford,Terrible.
Tom Haverford,He won't get out of my way!
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I caught feelings for you, and I want you to be my girl And I don't care who knows."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I've been a little down."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm not hungry."
Tom Haverford,I'm pivoting.
Tom Haverford,Ben told me to pivot.
Tom Haverford,"All right, that's illegal."
Tom Haverford,"I may not know much, but you can't just steal the ball from another player."
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I'm gonna put these in places you've never heard of."
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,Let's not get hung up on who wants what.
Tom Haverford,Zero.
Tom Haverford,Have you ever thought about Ron sexually?
Tom Haverford,"But now, I'm ready to pull myself up by some g-strings."
Tom Haverford,I'm getting divorced.
Tom Haverford,Totally natural.
Tom Haverford,"Bobby, great."
Tom Haverford,What are we doing?
Tom Haverford,Tommy for the dunk!
Tom Haverford,This is honestly the saddest I've ever been.
Tom Haverford,It takes forever to get off.
Tom Haverford,Now the real art begins.
Tom Haverford,It's my problem.
Tom Haverford,Don't tell Ron.
Tom Haverford,So don't tell anyone.
Tom Haverford,I didn't know until yesterday.
Tom Haverford,My crotch looks like a disco ball.
Tom Haverford,"Step one, nail this photo shoot with an amazing, iconic image."
Tom Haverford,"Step three, have sex with a model."
Tom Haverford,"Haverford playbook move number two ""ladies love a guy waiting for them in the rain."
Tom Haverford,Wendy's from Canada.
Tom Haverford,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Nature is throwing me a bone.
Tom Haverford,"Step two, book some outside gigs."
Tom Haverford,The reason I was acting weird yesterday was Wendy and I have a green card marriage.
Tom Haverford,"We now go live to Councilman Bill Dexhart, who's giving a press conference about his sex scandal."
Tom Haverford,Booboo?
Tom Haverford,"""That's so romantic,"" but you didn't, and now I got the sniffies."
Tom Haverford,"I was waiting outside in the rain for you, 'cause I thought you would come out and be like, ""aw, he's all wet."""
Tom Haverford,You can really taste the ignorance.
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,Listening to that tree lighting is gonna be dope.
Tom Haverford,I'm not eating racist salad.
Tom Haverford,Ann?
Tom Haverford,It is.
Tom Haverford,Not even close.
Tom Haverford,A young lawbreaker.
Tom Haverford,A future Leslie Knope.
Tom Haverford,"Play it again for us, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"No, thank you."
Tom Haverford,"Pawnee is a city that ain't very pretty, And good government is our goal"
Tom Haverford,That's a really big deal.
Tom Haverford,I don't know what's wrong with me.
Tom Haverford,Would you look at that?
Tom Haverford,"Step four, step in front of the camera, become a model."
Tom Haverford,"Carnival rides, games Sweetums is even building a plussized roller coaster for some of Pawnee's obese thrill seekers."
Tom Haverford,And then she's free to marry Ron Swanson.
Tom Haverford,Sixty days.
Tom Haverford,"Eh, he's too big."
Tom Haverford,I can't see over him.
Tom Haverford,It's not fair.
Tom Haverford,He's gonna ask her out.
Tom Haverford,I feel like everyone should be the same size.
Tom Haverford,Maybe give you an idea of what the disciplinary committee will be like?
Tom Haverford,"But right now, I hate it here, and I just want to see Wendy."
Tom Haverford,Now what?
Tom Haverford,"That girl up there, she's my emergency contact."
Tom Haverford,I've been to the Glitter Factory a million times.
Tom Haverford,Did I do basketball?
Tom Haverford,Do you want me to run some test questions with you?
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I need to tell you something."
Tom Haverford,He told me.
Tom Haverford,"If it's not him, it'll just be some other guy."
Tom Haverford,I feel much better.
Tom Haverford,I threw up a bunch of them this morning.
Tom Haverford,You know those hangover pills you can order on TV?
Tom Haverford,"Go, yes!"
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Tom Haverford,But who cares?
Tom Haverford,"Ann, can you give me something, anything, in the face?"
Tom Haverford,He's doing great!
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Tom Haverford,"So, the disciplinary committee awaits."
Tom Haverford,Feeling good?
Tom Haverford,Feeling strong?
Tom Haverford,You must be this wide to ride.
Tom Haverford,Do what Mark's doing.
Tom Haverford,Movies.
Tom Haverford,No Is he wearing a football uniform?
Tom Haverford,Is he covered in Powerade?
Tom Haverford,Those are some Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-ums right here.
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Those Ludacrises are coming in great.
Tom Haverford,"Look, Jamm saw you on Pawnee Today."
Tom Haverford,I totally understand.
Tom Haverford,"Lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and the guy from Sum 41, am I right?"
Tom Haverford,Those are some Diddys.
Tom Haverford,"Honestly, it's fine."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it."
Tom Haverford,You heard about my divorce?
Tom Haverford,Ah.
Tom Haverford,Mmhmm.
Tom Haverford,"Paid off handsomely, as you can see."
Tom Haverford,But we should get one for safety.
Tom Haverford,Bought some shoes online.
Tom Haverford,Would have been nice to have saved that.
Tom Haverford,"Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, tiny reporter."
Tom Haverford,"It was a huge win for Josh and the boys, and after a huge win, be sure to visit RentASwag on Durham Avenue for all your postgame press conference fashion rental needs."
Tom Haverford,"We've got everything: Dope suits, pocket squares, Gingham shirts, glasses with no lenses, Tiny cardigans, Fedoras Look at this watch! Whatever swag you need, You can rent at RentASwag."
Tom Haverford,"Now, that's basketball."
Tom Haverford,For [bleep] sake.
Tom Haverford,He's just trying to get something in return.
Tom Haverford,"Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants, I just give her the names of rappers."
Tom Haverford,He knows how much you want this.
Tom Haverford,"Look, look at my face."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm fine."
Tom Haverford,It's so hot.
Tom Haverford,I had to get some more iced tea.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Right.
Tom Haverford,Are you watching?
Tom Haverford,"I don't know what to do, man."
Tom Haverford,Took a risk.
Tom Haverford,"It's a 13 year old kid named Stevie, who likes to get high, and make his Transformers look like they're having sex together."
Tom Haverford,"But she covered for me, and I'm in the clear."
Tom Haverford,Focus up right where the weed is--
Tom Haverford,I was the one who shot you.
Tom Haverford,She was covering for me because I didn't have a hunting license.
Tom Haverford,It wasn't Leslie's fault.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, I have something to say."
Tom Haverford,Focus up right where the--
Tom Haverford,"Excuse me, everyone."
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, for the record, I was gonna come forward and I'll do it right now."
Tom Haverford,"Okay! Whoa! Ann! Whoa, are we finally gonna do this? Ow!"
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Hold on, this is amazing."
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,"But afterwards, can we come back here and talk about us?"
Tom Haverford,Amazing.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,You ready?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, great talk."
Tom Haverford,Tsk.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, are you about to give me the whole ""she's a great girl, I need to treat her right"" speech, since you guys used to date?"
Tom Haverford,Tsk.
Tom Haverford,It's really cool.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Just focus up on the pit.
Tom Haverford,You like it?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Tom Haverford,Everyone thinks it's Tommy Hilfiger.
Tom Haverford,Pretty bummed this fits.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, take a test shot."
Tom Haverford,"Dude, Ron, I'm so sorry."
Tom Haverford,Are you making love to him on a couch shaped like his mustache?
Tom Haverford,"I can't be like, ""Hey, Leslie, it's a green card marriage, I'm fine."""
Tom Haverford,Apparently you can get in trouble even after a divorce.
Tom Haverford,"I don't want to brag, but I have a ton of experience with women being mad at me."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, Ann's mad at me now, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve."
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, why not?"
Tom Haverford,"Never so much as even kissed, except for a little peck at the wedding ceremony for appearances."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"If you can handle that, I think you'll be fine."
Tom Haverford,I now see why girls do it.
Tom Haverford,"I think you sound like an angel, and everyone else sounds like demons."
Tom Haverford,Can I get two creme brulees and another glass of bronto grigio?
Tom Haverford,I'm still feeling pretty sad.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, garcon."
Tom Haverford,"Thank you, Donna."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, if there's anyone out there that's doing a photo shoot about the dangers of eating undercooked chicken, I can give you Ann's phone number."
Tom Haverford,I like pretending to be sad.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's stop for a second."
Tom Haverford,"So, that's kind of your worst case scenario, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"Thank you for your time, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"This committee doesn't take timeouts, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,It wasn't even a real marriage.
Tom Haverford,"The point is, I never meant anything to her."
Tom Haverford,Aspiring.
Tom Haverford,Now answer the question!
Tom Haverford,You're fired.
Tom Haverford,"I'm a short, beautiful government employee slash club promoter."
Tom Haverford,Does our marriage really make sense to you?
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, think about it."
Tom Haverford,How about some stolen wine?
Tom Haverford,How about a non-divorce?
Tom Haverford,How about a marriage?
Tom Haverford,Maxim or Good Housekeeping?
Tom Haverford,"She's a tall, beautiful surgeon."
Tom Haverford,You still can't tell anyone about the green card thing.
Tom Haverford,I don't know how to answer that.
Tom Haverford,You can have as many juice boxes as you want.
Tom Haverford,Would the Glitter Factory be okay with whoever suggested strip club?
Tom Haverford,And we need to do something to distract from this boring area.
Tom Haverford,I definitely heard someone say strip club.
Tom Haverford,"Now, I didn't want to have to do this, but we may have to go nude."
Tom Haverford,Did somebody say strip club?
Tom Haverford,Fair enough.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm sorry, your face just isn't working."
Tom Haverford,Did somebody say strip club?
Tom Haverford,This is a bargaining tool.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm really hurt."
Tom Haverford,Wendy and I are splitting up.
Tom Haverford,The rumors are true.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, everyone."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Rondoleezza Rice."
Tom Haverford,Strip club?
Tom Haverford,"Bobby, I love how you work."
Tom Haverford,How could someone so hot be so bad at looking hot?
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,"In fact, grab me one, too."
Tom Haverford,Make it an apple.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,That's exactly who I want shopping at RentASwag.
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna need a lot of wine, so keep it flowing."
Tom Haverford,"I'll have the surf and turf- asaurus, and a couple of bottles of wine."
Tom Haverford,Milton?
Tom Haverford,"Guys, I think I just dribbled up an idea."
Tom Haverford,"Mark, great job, you can have a juice box, too."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, take a walk with me."
Tom Haverford,"In a million years, I never thought you would be the problem with this photo shoot."
Tom Haverford,I just don't get it.
Tom Haverford,"He's, like, 150 years old."
Tom Haverford,Sounds okay.
Tom Haverford,"No, double dribbled it."
Tom Haverford,I think we got the boring cliche shot that Leslie wanted.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,I'll give you a few minutes to cancel the rest of your plans for the day.
Tom Haverford,Which tie do I wear?
Tom Haverford,I got a nightclub opening to go to.
Tom Haverford,I'm interested in real world expertise.
Tom Haverford,Boop!
Tom Haverford,That's me hitting the snooze button.
Tom Haverford,Don't talk again for another ten minutes.
Tom Haverford,That was a trick question.
Tom Haverford,But I don't care.
Tom Haverford,"Technically, you'd be assisting Ron, but Ron really doesn't do much government work, so you'd really be working for me."
Tom Haverford,Brian.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, hey and to my bride, Rihanna."
Tom Haverford,We truly did find love in a hopeless place.
Tom Haverford,"Waiter, a round of light flash shots for me and my friends!"
Tom Haverford,Whoo!
Tom Haverford,"I see your resume here. Education, exellent. Awesome professional experience."
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, mama!"
Tom Haverford,The answer's this one.
Tom Haverford,But those hopes have been dashed. You can leave.
Tom Haverford,Is the real winter inside our hearts?
Tom Haverford,We are all struggling for definition in a world that resists our inquiries.
Tom Haverford,Next slide.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,Weird.
Tom Haverford,How did that... That's a personal photo.
Tom Haverford,I had high hopes wen I saw your plum V neck.
Tom Haverford,"That's... Shouldn't be.. This must've... You know, I gotta say, I think that could actually work as our cover photo."
Tom Haverford,It's a high-res photo.
Tom Haverford,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Tom Haverford,A picture of parents pushing a kid on a swing?
Tom Haverford,"Man, if I ever have a bachelor party, I am definitely coming back here."
Tom Haverford,"No, it was a green card wedding."
Tom Haverford,"I did watch the threeway sex scene from Wild Things a few times the night before, but it didn't really count."
Tom Haverford,"I'm cool with it, if you guys are."
Tom Haverford,Are we alone?
Tom Haverford,You can have the wine.
Tom Haverford,What is he thinking?
Tom Haverford,Just give him what he wants.

Tom Haverford,"Doesn't stand for ""dumb, dumb, stupid."""
Tom Haverford,"Well, D.D.S."
Tom Haverford,Parking while Indian?
Tom Haverford,"I'm all right, Officer."
Tom Haverford,"No, it's okay."
Tom Haverford,My name is Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,I work for the Parks Department.
Tom Haverford,I just got locked out of the van.
Tom Haverford,I had to jimmy my way back in.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I just told you my ID."
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Tom Haverford,"Smile, friendly physical contact and flattery."
Tom Haverford,"It's called the ""Haverford Schmooze."""
Tom Haverford,What the hell?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it is, Ann."
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Mark's an idiot.
Tom Haverford,You can do a lot better than him.
Tom Haverford,Forget about him.
Tom Haverford,"What do you think? Amazing, right? I call this one ""The Future."""
Tom Haverford,I didn't mean me.
Tom Haverford,"You mean the ""Unhappy Wife"" photos?"
Tom Haverford,"Now you know what I meant by, ""Make your face better."""
Tom Haverford,Mark looks happy.
Tom Haverford,What? No! Take me home.
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?
Tom Haverford,Home!
Tom Haverford,"Keep it in your pants, Knope."
Tom Haverford,Three easy steps.
Tom Haverford,"Good meeting you, man! We should grab a drink or something sometime."
Tom Haverford,Ron 'P. Diddy' Combs.
Tom Haverford,"Before we do this next interview, there's a little secret I want to let you in on."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, your toast sucked."
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for waiting.
Tom Haverford,I appreciate it.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,"And here's the ""Obstruction"" series."
Tom Haverford,Wake up.
Tom Haverford,I swallowed it.
Tom Haverford,I feel a little queasy.
Tom Haverford,My stomach's a little upset.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man."
Tom Haverford,May I interest anyone in some chew?
Tom Haverford,"I have to admit, this place is pretty tight."
Tom Haverford,"You're supposed to swallow it, right?"
Tom Haverford,Anndanawicz! What're you guys doing? Eating? Love it.
Tom Haverford,"And I'm hoping to parlay this into a membership at the Pawnee Smokehouse, Pawnee's most exclusive cigar club."
Tom Haverford,"And that stale tobacco stench that says, ""Welcome to the top."""
Tom Haverford,My parents are Indian.
Tom Haverford,Then he told me some veneers could really make my smile pop.
Tom Haverford,"My birth name is Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani, and I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics."
Tom Haverford,"Don't freak out, but Joe from Sewage just unhooked your bra with his eyes."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, yeah, fine, Barack Obama."
Tom Haverford,"If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was going to be elected President, yeah, maybe I wouldn't have changed it."
Tom Haverford,I was conceived in America.
Tom Haverford,He just said that he changed his mind.
Tom Haverford,That is Andy.
Tom Haverford,We're getting you a new suit.
Tom Haverford,He's voting no on fun in the sun.
Tom Haverford,Councilman Jamm changed his vote.
Tom Haverford,"That's so not the point, you nerd."
Tom Haverford,You're living in the pit now?
Tom Haverford,Just take pictures.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Thoughts?
Tom Haverford,I'm just saying.
Tom Haverford,Nobody turns him down.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Because Brooks Brothers Boys doesn't make garbage.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,"You shouldn't, because it looks like garbage."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,I've let this go on long enough.
Tom Haverford,Longer.
Tom Haverford,Soon to be number three.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,I'm from South Carolina.
Tom Haverford,"We're coming for you, San Antonio."
Tom Haverford,My mother's uterus.
Tom Haverford,Leslie's been playing shovel guitar for about an hour now.
Tom Haverford,"Overstuffed leather chairs, top shelf brandies."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,What's that gonna do? I'm gonna shoot under its head!
Tom Haverford,Is he gonna live?
Tom Haverford,Is he okay?
Tom Haverford,This is on you.
Tom Haverford,"But you are too hot to hide, Ann."
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,I texted them while we were on the date.
Tom Haverford,"Man, I love a good stogie."
Tom Haverford,As soon as I possibly could.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,"You're a member of the Pawnee Smokehouse, right?"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,You got to be kidding me.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I told them we went on a date.
Tom Haverford,"""Because your arms are guns."""
Tom Haverford,I actually just had this personalized cigar cutter made.
Tom Haverford,She's out on a--
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna get my gun.
Tom Haverford,It could still be out there.
Tom Haverford,We should cover ourselves in mud.
Tom Haverford,"""Was your dad RoboCop?"""
Tom Haverford,And it wasn't human.
Tom Haverford,I did smell something out there.
Tom Haverford,"On a scale of one to Chris Brown, how pissed is he?"
Tom Haverford,Man is the most dangerous game.
Tom Haverford,It could have been someone else that shot Ron.
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, Perd."""
Tom Haverford,"Hey, so, uh, we're still all good on Leslie's bill, right?"
Tom Haverford,Maybe Ron shot himself.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, well, it's not Okay."
Tom Haverford,Doing good tonight.
Tom Haverford,Someone not in our group.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, hey, just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night."
Tom Haverford,That was cool.
Tom Haverford,Peace!
Tom Haverford,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry."
Tom Haverford,Wish number three.
Tom Haverford,"So, Ann, it's finally happening."
Tom Haverford,They remake Point Break.
Tom Haverford,I play both roles.
Tom Haverford,Keanu and Swayze.
Tom Haverford,"Can I be honest, though? I'm a little freaked out."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, whoa!"
Tom Haverford,What happened?
Tom Haverford,Yuck.
Tom Haverford,Not true.
Tom Haverford,I ate everything you did.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,Smells like some vomit took a dump in here.
Tom Haverford,I didn't eat those stupid mini calzones.
Tom Haverford,"Like, I don't really understand what's going on."
Tom Haverford,"No, no."
Tom Haverford,I'm the CEO of the Spike TV network.
Tom Haverford,We've got to go back to the shapes.
Tom Haverford,This is garbage.
Tom Haverford,Where are the shapes?
Tom Haverford,"There's not even one shape in there, Mark."
Tom Haverford,It's mush.
Tom Haverford,I'm into it now.
Tom Haverford,It's nothing.
Tom Haverford,And my best friend slash personal assistant is Oscar winner Jamie Foxx.
Tom Haverford,"And we create a raunchy animated series based on our friendship, called Tommy and the Foxx."
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,Then we go back to my place and snuggle up Like little bunnies.
Tom Haverford,"Consider this alternate plan, we have drinks here, get to know each other, whatever."
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,You got to be kidding me.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Haverfood rule number six never eat anything with a sauce I have to dip myself.
Tom Haverford,I'm not your maid.
Tom Haverford,"I'm not sure you're even aware of this, but we have now gone 48 hours without breaking up, shattering our previous record."
Tom Haverford,To celebrate
Tom Haverford,"No, I really liked them, and they happened to have nice breasts."
Tom Haverford,You're acting really weird.
Tom Haverford,What did you even buy me lunch for?
Tom Haverford,Why would you want a mural that shows people dying when you could have shapes that come alive?
Tom Haverford,"Don't talk about it anymore, please."
Tom Haverford,Just so you could yell at me for what I like about women?
Tom Haverford,Yay.
Tom Haverford,You wanna date me!
Tom Haverford,This is a date!
Tom Haverford,"You took me to a fancy restaurant, you paid for my meal, and you're trying to get to know me better."
Tom Haverford,Nice try.
Tom Haverford,You love me.
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Tom Haverford,Drizzle it on for me.
Tom Haverford,Negative a billion.
Tom Haverford,Zero.
Tom Haverford,One.
Tom Haverford,One.
Tom Haverford,"All right, well, Tommy feels great."
Tom Haverford,And I'm about to go eat some lasagna.
Tom Haverford,Peace!
Tom Haverford,Only God could do that.
Tom Haverford,One to one to one to one to one to one.
Tom Haverford,No kid could do that.
Tom Haverford,"Look, there's something about those shapes."
Tom Haverford,One.
Tom Haverford,One.
Tom Haverford,Eight.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, sweetheart."
Tom Haverford,One.
Tom Haverford,There's some emotional art right there.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,This is an outrage.
Tom Haverford,Mark's not even in the department.
Tom Haverford,It's pretty great having Andy working in the building.
Tom Haverford,"I'm tearing up, man."
Tom Haverford,And the red circle right here.
Tom Haverford,I like the green one.
Tom Haverford,I've looked at this for five hours now.
Tom Haverford,It's beautiful.
Tom Haverford,The guy is so much fun.
Tom Haverford,This one's racist.
Tom Haverford,Neither do I! Just do another one.
Tom Haverford,It's not as good as the other one.
Tom Haverford,Traytrays are entrees.
Tom Haverford,"I call sandwiches sammies, sandoozles, or Adam Sandlers."
Tom Haverford,"Caterer number one's presentation was simple, mm, yet exhausting."
Tom Haverford,"Number two's was subtle and provocative, like a coy Dutch woman guarding a dark secret."
Tom Haverford,Shut up and do more art for me.
Tom Haverford,"Air conditioners are cool blasterz, with a Z."
Tom Haverford,His new thing?
Tom Haverford,Anytime you want.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm calling to lodge a complaint about the seaweed and almond undereye cream I purchased from you guys."
Tom Haverford,He's never taken me.
Tom Haverford,Not all the guys.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my problem is it smells terrible."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I even mixed it with another undereye cream and it still smelled."
Tom Haverford,Piggyback rides!
Tom Haverford,"So, I ruined two eye creams."
Tom Haverford,"Forever young, I wanna be forever young, Do you really wanna live forever"
Tom Haverford,Forever young I wanna be
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Tom Haverford,"No, I don't really feel like going to J.J's."
Tom Haverford,Can I get apps and 'zerts?
Tom Haverford,'Zerts are what I call desserts.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I will hold."
Tom Haverford,But number three's told a story a story from a book I wouldn't read but I would watch the movie of.
Tom Haverford,I don't know where that came from.
Tom Haverford,I call cakes big ol' cookies.
Tom Haverford,First wish?
Tom Haverford,I might have misread the vibe.
Tom Haverford,Is this not one of those?
Tom Haverford,I have a huge house with a ton of balconies.
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's do this."
Tom Haverford,"""Winnie the boo,"" ""Lady preshpresh,"" ""Ann Berry sauce,"" ""Annie get your boo,"" ""Tommy's girl,"" ""Annie banannie"" Hey!"
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,""" We have ""cookie tush"" Wow, just right out the gate."
Tom Haverford,"And I would just stand out there and survey my empire, like a drug dealer in a Michael Bay movie."
Tom Haverford,Booboo bear.
Tom Haverford,And I'll just spend my time out there reading my iPad and drinking espressos in a terry cloth robe.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Booboo bear."
Tom Haverford,And that counts for something.
Tom Haverford,But Ann's hot.
Tom Haverford,"It's one of several nicknames I made up for you, and you can choose which one you like best, 'cause I want this to be a give and take."
Tom Haverford,I feel like you're embarrassed by me.
Tom Haverford,"Can I at least change my Facebook status to ""In a relationship""?"
Tom Haverford,"""It's complicated""?"
Tom Haverford,I call noodles longass rice.
Tom Haverford,Fried chicken is fry fry chicky chick.
Tom Haverford,Chicken parm is chicky chicky parm parm.
Tom Haverford,Chicken cacciatore?
Tom Haverford,Chicky catch.
Tom Haverford,I call eggs prebirds or future birds.
Tom Haverford,Root beer is super water.
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Tom Haverford,Tortillas are bean blankies.
Tom Haverford,And I call forks food rakes.
Tom Haverford,"Well, let's get in my go go mobile."
Tom Haverford,Car.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,It's complicated.
Tom Haverford,Am I in a relationship?
Tom Haverford,No one cares.
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Tom Haverford,Ginuwine?
Tom Haverford,The Ginuwine is your cousin?
Tom Haverford,And I'm entitled to money to maintain that lifestyle.
Tom Haverford,"When we were married, I got accustomed to a certain lifestyle."
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I went to best buy and bought a phone."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm thinking we junk everything except the mannequins."
Tom Haverford,Ron's gotta see how dope the outfits are.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, it's insane, but it's all I got."
Tom Haverford,That's the business.
Tom Haverford,"Look, a bank's not gonna give us a loan, and Ron loves my entrepreneurial spirit."
Tom Haverford,"Trust me, he's our best chance at getting startup money."
Tom Haverford,"A deer jumped in front of the car, and then a bear jumped in front of the deer!"
Tom Haverford,"No, we gotta work."
Tom Haverford,Didn't you hear me say we gotta junk most of the presentation?
Tom Haverford,"I hate to say this, but Sometimes you've gotta work a little, so you can ball a lot."
Tom Haverford,Which was a huge failure.
Tom Haverford,Welcome back.
Tom Haverford,And you can make it all go away if you just gave me a chance.
Tom Haverford,One date.
Tom Haverford,He's my business partner.
Tom Haverford,That's just one of many skills he brings to this business partnership.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Can we still go suit shopping?
Tom Haverford,Is it my fault? Did I do something wrong?
Tom Haverford,Let me talk to Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Three dates.
Tom Haverford,We can fix this.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, champ."
Tom Haverford,Are we walking to best buy to get a better phone?
Tom Haverford,"Where are we going, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Coffee?
Tom Haverford,You guys can't break up.
Tom Haverford,Of course he is.
Tom Haverford,He needs a lot of support.
Tom Haverford,"You went on a vacation and you chose Muncie, Indiana?"
Tom Haverford,"Do you? You know I love you, but I don't think you're as serious about this business as I am."
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,Jerry just farted.
Tom Haverford,I will accept this gift of rehabilitation.
Tom Haverford,I've hurt all my friends and family with my addiction.
Tom Haverford,I am an addict.
Tom Haverford,"Look, man, I believe in this idea."
Tom Haverford,You're right.
Tom Haverford,I've downloaded every episode of Intervention.
Tom Haverford,But you told me to get it all out of my system.
Tom Haverford,"And I think we should give it a shot, for real."
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, I know our marriage was fake, but there's something between us."
Tom Haverford,But think about how much better our friendship would be if we added doing it.
Tom Haverford,For now.
Tom Haverford,I know what to do here.
Tom Haverford,Talking about a bra for a man.
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?
Tom Haverford,I can't figure out how to phrase this mission statement.
Tom Haverford,In Muncie?
Tom Haverford,"You were in charge of watching a tiny horse, and you failed."
Tom Haverford,Deal.
Tom Haverford,"It says here ""1:00 meeting."""
Tom Haverford,And who are we meeting with?
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Tom Haverford,"See? You just googled, ""Amanda Bynes side boob."""
Tom Haverford,"Well Jerry, what the hell?"
Tom Haverford,"What do you say you chop up some more wood, and I'll take your car and go grab us some victory steaks?"
Tom Haverford,"I've had a breakthrough, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Well, if that's true, then you're going to have to answer to the whole town."
Tom Haverford,And God.
Tom Haverford,"Everything I'm wearing is suede, everything I'm wearing is suede!"
Tom Haverford,"Help, everything I'm wearing is suede!"
Tom Haverford,Jerry's fault.
Tom Haverford,"Well, it's almost Valentine's Day, so I thought it would be a good day to tell you that--"
Tom Haverford,Jerry's fault.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to go with Jerry.
Tom Haverford,You know the Snakehole's my favorite Pawnee hot spot.
Tom Haverford,No worries.
Tom Haverford,Got got.
Tom Haverford,I got you temporary approval from the liquor board pending full board authorization and council review.
Tom Haverford,"Your liquor license renewal got got, yo."
Tom Haverford,Good news!
Tom Haverford,I want to open up my own club one day.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Freddy."
Tom Haverford,Another in a long string of miserable failures.
Tom Haverford,You lost Little Sebastian!
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,"Hopefully I can get you out this mess, that you and no one else caused."
Tom Haverford,It's a poor workman that blames his tools.
Tom Haverford,You look for him.
Tom Haverford,Unbelievable.
Tom Haverford,I'm going to go tell everyone what you did.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe call it something like Cluba-Dub-Dub or The Clubmarine, sort of a submarine themed club."
Tom Haverford,"The word ""bistro"" is classy as [bleep]."
Tom Haverford,Most people look at Little Sebastian and they see a famous minihorse.
Tom Haverford,"I see an advertising opportunity for my club, the Snakehole Lounge."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,That is a shockingly huge minihorse erection.
Tom Haverford,Wouldn't it be karma if we were the ones that got mugged?
Tom Haverford,"So, anytime someone takes a picture of him, the Snakehole's logo is in it."
Tom Haverford,Or Tom's Bistro.
Tom Haverford,Am I a genius or what?
Tom Haverford,"I will see you Friday with 10,000 dollars."
Tom Haverford,That's chump change.
Tom Haverford,10000 dollars.
Tom Haverford,To help me.
Tom Haverford,That's why I got into public service.
Tom Haverford,I agree.
Tom Haverford,"Somebody left the gate open and he got out, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,He's the one who deliberated caused me to accidentally let the horse out.
Tom Haverford,He doesn't have a black eye.
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna wear?
Tom Haverford,I think I'm more than holding my own here.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, you should come out tonight."
Tom Haverford,You mean what are you gonna do?
Tom Haverford,What am do gonna I? That's a great question Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Can you believe we left Little Sebastian with the gentleman?
Tom Haverford,Ron in 60 seconds.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I've been working on my presentation.
Tom Haverford,Yes About that.
Tom Haverford,"I was wondering, is there any chance we could reschedule?"
Tom Haverford,"I just want to make sure everything is up to my worldclass ""standees."""
Tom Haverford,"Of course, yes."
Tom Haverford,"No problem, 8:00 a.m. tomorrow."
Tom Haverford,I think you're gonna be very impressed with our presentation.
Tom Haverford,"I just came by to congratulate Leslie, and then I'm heading back."
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,I am not a weakling.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm pretty sure you have nothing else going on."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, seriously."
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna wear tonight?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you mind if I ask?"
Tom Haverford,Did you Leslie!
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,It's Little Sebastian.
Tom Haverford,Club's gonna be dope.
Tom Haverford,He's gone.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
Tom Haverford,Come on down to the Snakehole.
Tom Haverford,I think she's gonna murder you.
Tom Haverford,You should probably get out of that.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry let him escape, and we don't know where he is."
Tom Haverford,"Well, this is for you."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, fine."
Tom Haverford,He's a renaissance man.
Tom Haverford,Too slow.
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Jer."
Tom Haverford,And tonight's just not about pleasure.
Tom Haverford,"He's a fully grown man, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"It's ""Allergic,"" and forget it."
Tom Haverford,Bye.
Tom Haverford,Jerry! You stepped on DJ Roomba!
Tom Haverford,I'm around.
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,So you want to be my CFO?
Tom Haverford,"And sausage, 'cause I am brown and spicy."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, it was a disaster."
Tom Haverford,Too bad we didn't see it coming.
Tom Haverford,"All right, what's my first move?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Why don't you get some Canadian bacon on it, since you're from Canada."
Tom Haverford,You killed him! I built him myself.
Tom Haverford,Are you serious?
Tom Haverford,It's a real idea.
Tom Haverford,"So get this Kids are always growing out of their clothes, so their parents don't want to buy 'em nice things."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna rent my upscale clothing to middle school kids, because I discovered I'm roughly the same size as the average Pawnee 12 year old."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,"Can you take a look at the business plan, tell me what do you think?"
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,He was like a son to me.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, guys."
Tom Haverford,"Everybody go home, pack away my stuff in your own houses."
Tom Haverford,I got it.
Tom Haverford,I promised Wendy I'd be out of here tonight.
Tom Haverford,"No, I can't put it there."
Tom Haverford,"Apparently, there's been some sort of gas leak and I can't move into my place until Monday now."
Tom Haverford,I just got off the phone with my new landlord.
Tom Haverford,"Then on Monday, pack it back up, meet me at my new place, unload it there."
Tom Haverford,I'm kidding.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, that'd be great, yeah."
Tom Haverford,This thing is a mess.
Tom Haverford,"His ether based perfume, Blackout, was named one of Maxim's top hundred ways to trick someone into sex."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my escargot delivery service, Snail Mail."
Tom Haverford,So you want to partner up and make history?
Tom Haverford,"I mean, you've already made history as the world's most beautiful CEO."
Tom Haverford,"Let's dance for a little while, Mark."
Tom Haverford,"Well, all press is good press."
Tom Haverford,"Club opens at 6:00, event starts at 9:00."
Tom Haverford,"DJ Roomba, tearing it up!"
Tom Haverford,Little guy cruises around and plays music.
Tom Haverford,"I call him ""DJ Roomba."""
Tom Haverford,I strapped an MP3 player to one of those floor cleaning robots.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"No, it's a spare room I converted into a walk-in closet/ home fitness center."
Tom Haverford,"Just to clarify, it's a no to me on all fronts, and you're offering Ben a job?"
Tom Haverford,"What's hot, DJ Roomba?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, we'll still be friends."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,How much is the next day shipping?
Tom Haverford,What's this one?
Tom Haverford,Are you serious?
Tom Haverford,My pocket squares!
Tom Haverford,Ah!
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,There's plenty of room.
Tom Haverford,"I need to order the brown Timberlands in a size eight, narrow."
Tom Haverford,"Put it in your truck, Brendanawicz."
Tom Haverford,That dude is strong.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I saw Mark carrying, like, three boxes."
Tom Haverford,Just one.
Tom Haverford,"Just for one person, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'd like to place an order for one pad thai, chicken, and no scallions on it, please."
Tom Haverford,"And, what's two day shipping?"
Tom Haverford,"Go get 'em, champ!"
Tom Haverford,We specialize in making stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks.
Tom Haverford,I have a new company and could use your help on the math side of things.
Tom Haverford,This is actually a crazy coincidence.
Tom Haverford,But that's not important.
Tom Haverford,Let me tell you about Rent A Swag.
Tom Haverford,Now
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,I appreciate it.
Tom Haverford,"We don't have a lot in common, but we chat quite a bit."
Tom Haverford,I stayed up most of the night.
Tom Haverford,It's actually a guy named Brad that's a teacher in Pittsburgh.
Tom Haverford,Pitt.
Tom Haverford,Justin's not here.
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Tom Haverford,Those people are old.
Tom Haverford,Are we talking a.m. or p.m.?
Tom Haverford,It wasn't the actor.
Tom Haverford,Absolutely.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, not really."
Tom Haverford,"Instead of saying, ""What up, boo?"""
Tom Haverford,You don't know Jay-Z's schedule.
Tom Haverford,Jay-Z drinks this.
Tom Haverford,This is Armand de Brignac.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,Some champagne?
Tom Haverford,Have a seat.
Tom Haverford,"""Emoji"" are little cartoons you text instead of words."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I do."
Tom Haverford,"JeanRalphio and I have one called ""Nacho average podcast,"" where we rate different kinds of nachos."
Tom Haverford,"There are a million of 'em, and they're all amazing."
Tom Haverford,Podcasts.
Tom Haverford,"There's even a little Indian guy, but he has a turban on, which I think is racist, but the Asian guy also has a racist hat on, and it's like, ""Hold up, didn't Japanese people invent this?"""
Tom Haverford,"You can type ""What up,"" and then a cute, little ghost, 'cause that means ""boo."""
Tom Haverford,Terminator.
Tom Haverford,It seems like
Tom Haverford,I hit up Brad.
Tom Haverford,You can talk to anybody.
Tom Haverford,I love GChat.
Tom Haverford,Full disclosure.
Tom Haverford,Carl is the head of all outdoor security.
Tom Haverford,"Why was he transferred from his indoor desk job, you ask."
Tom Haverford,Listen.
Tom Haverford,"I'm schmoozing Dennis Feinstein so I can pitch him my new cologne, Tommy Fresh."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna follow you and play the Black Eyed Peas on a non-stop loop!
Tom Haverford,Ann and I are romantically intertwined.
Tom Haverford,"Why did you kill me? I'm gonna haunt you, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"Actually, seven is the worldwide average."
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,If it isn't Mr. Looks and Professor Books.
Tom Haverford,He's Looks.
Tom Haverford,"Of course you do, Books."
Tom Haverford,What's going on?
Tom Haverford,Jerry! Jerry! This is the ghost of DJ Roomba.
Tom Haverford,"Please, no."
Tom Haverford,So let's not be surprised if she picks my idea.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Tom Haverford,You should let him do this.
Tom Haverford,I think Justin's right.
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Tom Haverford,What's the difference?

Tom Haverford,"Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero, but he changed it to Dennis Feinstein 'cause that's way more exotic in Pawnee."
Tom Haverford,Maybe some GasX?
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,"Doctor, medically speaking, how would you describe what happened to Jerry?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but he also exhibited excessive flatulence."

Tom Haverford,"I was like, of course, Roy's."
Tom Haverford,"I was like, ""Man, that fence looks awesome."""
Tom Haverford,I drove by one of your fences the other day.
Tom Haverford,"Here's the gun, here's me."
Tom Haverford,""" Everything you just said makes me like me more."
Tom Haverford,"Please, send me to jail!"

Tom Haverford,I'll puff to that.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, that's great."
Tom Haverford,I gotta get back out there.
Tom Haverford,"You know what they say, animal on the head, manimal in the bed."
Tom Haverford,"All right, Team Haverford."
Tom Haverford,"Man, Jamm's gotta be pretty mad at us."
Tom Haverford,"Damn, girl!"
Tom Haverford,"Whoa! ""Smoke Dog."""
Tom Haverford,Your hotness killed my raccoon!
Tom Haverford,I have a raccoon hat.
Tom Haverford,I'm an interesting person.
Tom Haverford,Your new city council office.
Tom Haverford,Now you're talking.
Tom Haverford,and Here's our invitation.
Tom Haverford,Everything from Jerry goes directly to spam.
Tom Haverford,"So a while ago, I put a filter on all our accounts."
Tom Haverford,"And who knows, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"One, we're building a new park, two, I'm on the committee, three, you're putting in the sod."
Tom Haverford,"Look, here's the one, two, three of the situation."
Tom Haverford,How's my number one sod man doing?
Tom Haverford,"What's up, buddy?"
Tom Haverford,Mickey!
Tom Haverford,It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
Tom Haverford,I do not like this.
Tom Haverford,Peace.
Tom Haverford,Why does everyone act like Jerry's the victim here?
Tom Haverford,He's the one that didn't invite us to his Christmas party.
Tom Haverford,Jerry Filter!
Tom Haverford,"So, I'm gonna head out."
Tom Haverford,"You guys are awesome, but I think I might work better as a solo artist."
Tom Haverford,"Unsurprisingly, Jerry sends a lot of annoying emails."
Tom Haverford,"3.4, according to my GPS, which I used to use every day."
Tom Haverford,"So, this is a really big room I need packed up, guys."
Tom Haverford,I can't use screens for a week.
Tom Haverford,Big deal!
Tom Haverford,'Cause I didn't even notice.
Tom Haverford,Is my shirt lighting up?
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, what's up?"
Tom Haverford,"Sequins, minus the gloves."
Tom Haverford,Sequins!
Tom Haverford,"All right, guys."
Tom Haverford,Tommy Timberlake.
Tom Haverford,Justin's my savior.
Tom Haverford,He wears the same soup-stained khakis every day.
Tom Haverford,Jerry?
Tom Haverford,Who am I supposed to ask for fashion advice?
Tom Haverford,"I'm getting divorced, so I'm trying to up my game."
Tom Haverford,"Good call, J."
Tom Haverford,He's like an issue of GQ that's come to life.
Tom Haverford,I work at the Parks Department.
Tom Haverford,Let's talk accessories.
Tom Haverford,Which cane do you like better?
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, white Urkel."
Tom Haverford,What are you even still doing here?
Tom Haverford,Harvest Festival is over.
Tom Haverford,Eagle medallion!
Tom Haverford,"What's cracking, boo?"""
Tom Haverford,"""What's cracking, girl?"""
Tom Haverford,Be honest.
Tom Haverford,"""I'm Tom."""
Tom Haverford,I can have it say whatever I want.
Tom Haverford,"Belt buckle, says, ""What's cracking?"""
Tom Haverford,Serpent?
Tom Haverford,Dragon?
Tom Haverford,Serpent?
Tom Haverford,Dragon?
Tom Haverford,"It can say, ""What's cracking?"""
Tom Haverford,Great idea.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, I'm Tom Haverford."
Tom Haverford,Take care.
Tom Haverford,"Fresh air, no screens."
Tom Haverford,You're ruining it.
Tom Haverford,This is a great idea.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"No, she's my soon-to-be ex-wife."
Tom Haverford,"But I can't, because Leslie loves using people for her own gain."
Tom Haverford,Totally uncalled for.
Tom Haverford,I would like to say that Leslie is incapable of using people for her own gain.
Tom Haverford,"Much like women in '90s standup comedy routines, Tommy be shopping."
Tom Haverford,I started a business where I rent my fancy clothes to teens so their parents don't have to buy them nice things they'll just grow out of.
Tom Haverford,"So if you see a 14 year old kid wearing a Louis Vuitton cravat, you know who to thank."
Tom Haverford,Me.
Tom Haverford,And Louis Vuitton for making some dopeass cravats.
Tom Haverford,"The place needs some work, but this is a great location."
Tom Haverford,"Friends, former lovers, acquaintances, Jerry, I introduce you to the future home of RentASwag!"
Tom Haverford,You sure you don't want to come hang out for a minute?
Tom Haverford,I'm getting really good at chopping wood too.
Tom Haverford,I got stung by the wood!
Tom Haverford,"I'm not gay, but you're the most incredible man I've ever met."
Tom Haverford,Did Leslie tell you--
Tom Haverford,"What's up, brother?"
Tom Haverford,J Train!
Tom Haverford,Shouldn't you be back in Indianapolis?
Tom Haverford,Wwwaa!
Tom Haverford,Ow!
Tom Haverford,Wha?
Tom Haverford,There's no time for the edge network.
Tom Haverford,"I need a iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, something with 4G."
Tom Haverford,I need to get on webMD now!
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us what your idea is so I can go back to the Thunderdome."
Tom Haverford,That's what I'm calling my tent.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, it's a splinter."
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,"Lots of foot traffic, no metered parking."
Tom Haverford,"I still think we should find a computer and Google ""sterilization techniques."""
Tom Haverford,"Quick question, do you personally know Xzibit?"
Tom Haverford,"Every day I start by hitting up Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, and Instagram."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, worth a shot."
Tom Haverford,I need to go check my email.
Tom Haverford,I love that song.
Tom Haverford,"I've never been before, but I think I'm gonna love it."
Tom Haverford,Why am I gonna love it?
Tom Haverford,"Sometimes I like to throw in LinkedIn, for the professional shorties."
Tom Haverford,SkyMall.
Tom Haverford,I can't believe these things are healthy.
Tom Haverford,I ordered a bunch of crap off SkyMall.
Tom Haverford,What's that over there?
Tom Haverford,"I got my TV, my Xbox, DVD."
Tom Haverford,I'm fine.
Tom Haverford,Just don't worry about it.
Tom Haverford,Come check out my tent.
Tom Haverford,Awesome bed right there.
Tom Haverford,Then I like to go on reddit.
Tom Haverford,What is happening?
Tom Haverford,"That's the Canadian version, and there's a bonus audio track where LL Cool J raps all his dialog."
Tom Haverford,And the plasma TV.
Tom Haverford,And some furniture.
Tom Haverford,"It is, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Not to mention in the last month alone three people have confused me for a shorter, Indian Ryan Gosling."
Tom Haverford,I have a question.
Tom Haverford,"Reddit's great, 'cause it has all the important links you need."
Tom Haverford,"What, are you gonna offer him a job?"
Tom Haverford,Can I grab onto your boob for support?
Tom Haverford,Didn't you hear him?
Tom Haverford,He stinks on TV.
Tom Haverford,He sweats.
Tom Haverford,He stutters.
Tom Haverford,"It's like The King's Speech, but the first part, before he's fixed."
Tom Haverford,What if we're scaling a cliff and I start to fall?
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz!
Tom Haverford,DJ Roomba's in the mix.
Tom Haverford,It's like I'm not even camping.
Tom Haverford,The Pawnee Amphitheater.
Tom Haverford,Not that much.
Tom Haverford,"200, 300 million."
Tom Haverford,See you guys later.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,'Cause an hour ago you told me you'd rather watch a sex tape of your grandparents.
Tom Haverford,Until now.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,"Andy, I have a very interesting business proposal for you."
Tom Haverford,My boy!
Tom Haverford,"You can bring up the Markmobile, help me move, right?"
Tom Haverford,Just some odds and ends.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, so, listen, I need to move some stuff this weekend into my new bachelor pad, since my divorce is finally going down."
Tom Haverford,"Because I was checking out that pickup truck of yours, and that ride is pimped!"
Tom Haverford,I'm moving a lot of heavy stuff out of my place this weekend.
Tom Haverford,Waiting for the right time.
Tom Haverford,Because we don't have an adequate concert venue.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,"This is actually a dog couch, but it's super comfortable."
Tom Haverford,And bring some coffee.
Tom Haverford,Don't talk about yourself like that.
Tom Haverford,"Ooh, I thought the mover supplied those."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man."
Tom Haverford,Get any more job offers since I last saw you?
Tom Haverford,9:30
Tom Haverford,"What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and Drake all have in common?"
Tom Haverford,Maybe I can't hack this.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should take a cue from you and stick with my boring day job.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,"If it was remotely interesting, there would be a show on A&E about it."
Tom Haverford,They have a show about storage unit auctions.
Tom Haverford,And what they have in common is none of them have ever performed in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, man."
Tom Haverford,And it's well within my fiscal range.
Tom Haverford,Tommy Timberlake is dead.
Tom Haverford,Long live Thomas M.
Tom Haverford,Pizza party!
Tom Haverford,"Cheese is a topping, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"And why are these lights blaring, by the way?"
Tom Haverford,Does someone here own stock in the electric company?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,How long have we been here?
Tom Haverford,Now I have a small treat for you guys for all your hard work.
Tom Haverford,No! I was TiVoing Cupcake Wars.
Tom Haverford,Don't worry about it.
Tom Haverford,Just don't invite any boring people like Jerry.
Tom Haverford,I'm there.
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding?
Tom Haverford,For Justin?
Tom Haverford,South Carolina?
Tom Haverford,"Look, I am used to a certain level of comfort in my life, and I didn't want to sacrifice that."
Tom Haverford,I call the bed.
Tom Haverford,And I'm $46 under budget.
Tom Haverford,Chocolate or butterscotch?
Tom Haverford,Gonna have to refoliate them.
Tom Haverford,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Justin."
Tom Haverford,I don't have the heart to tell them what's going to happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994.
Tom Haverford,People in this town are just now getting into Nirvana.
Tom Haverford,Pawnee is the opposite of hip.
Tom Haverford,This is the best I can do for now.
Tom Haverford,"Well done, team."
Tom Haverford,Justin is hip.
Tom Haverford,I want him to respect my handshake.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to creep Justin out.
Tom Haverford,I can't tell if I've exfoliated too much.
Tom Haverford,Shake my hand.
Tom Haverford,"April, come here."
Tom Haverford,What do you think of the place?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, Jerry, when you check your email, you go to Altavista and type ""Please go to yahoo.com?"""
Tom Haverford,I hate this place. This place is the exact opposite of Sky Mall.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, she's asleep."
Tom Haverford,I'm not chipping in for gas.
Tom Haverford,April.
Tom Haverford,I'll have the pancake breakfast.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, let me also get 12 eggs, uncooked, and some toast."
Tom Haverford,"20 slices, untoasted, in a row in a bag."
Tom Haverford,Jerry's here.
Tom Haverford,You're driving.
Tom Haverford,It's amazing.
Tom Haverford,I really wish you could click those.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,That Tom ruined everything.
Tom Haverford,I built a real life Pinterest board.
Tom Haverford,Are we nearing the point?
Tom Haverford,I'm adapting.
Tom Haverford,Don't offer to pay if you're gonna be cheap.
Tom Haverford,You probably should just sit there and not move.
Tom Haverford,"It was your idea, so you're paying."
Tom Haverford,"You'll be served with a lawsuit, and we will move on with our lives."
Tom Haverford,Haverkins it is.
Tom Haverford,To Tan.
Tom Haverford,"It's ""Tan."""
Tom Haverford,I'd also like to announce our official relationship mash-up name.
Tom Haverford,It's also about Ann and I getting back together and being the hottest couple in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, today is your birthday, but it's about much more than that."
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Tom Haverford,"Well, we got back together again 'cause of what you said."
Tom Haverford,Hi.
Tom Haverford,"Attention, please."
Tom Haverford,"I've been going over the books, and I'm missing 9 dollars."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I'm not angry at whoever took it."
Tom Haverford,Just come forward.
Tom Haverford,"You know, normally, I don't agree with Leslie about anything, but this book is awesome."
Tom Haverford,You don't have your email bookmarked?
Tom Haverford,Do you have any bookmarks?
Tom Haverford,"God, Jerry!"
Tom Haverford,How could you invite Wendy when Ron's here?
Tom Haverford,What the hell are you doing?
Tom Haverford,Here's a better idea.
Tom Haverford,How about I bounce my way over to my dog couch and watch a little Season Six of Top Chef?
Tom Haverford,I know Leslie seems upset.
Tom Haverford,"But the truth is, she's better than us at this stuff by a thousand miles."
Tom Haverford,He's gonna wrap her up in his moustache and take her home.
Tom Haverford,"So, there's really no point."
Tom Haverford,"Donna, you and your work are ravishing, as usual."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, great organizational skills."
Tom Haverford,Care for some fondue?
Tom Haverford,I just return it the next day and claim it was defective.
Tom Haverford,It's a tip I picked up from Lee Iacocca's autobiography.
Tom Haverford,A small connection between you and your workers helps build loyalty.
Tom Haverford,"Great work, team."
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Tom Haverford,That makes sense.
Tom Haverford,"Haverford, responsible tycoon."
Tom Haverford,Pawnee's own Dennis Feinstein is a real up-and-comer in the world of microbrewed perfumes and body sprays.
Tom Haverford,"It's a launch party for Dennis Feinstein's new fragrance, Allergic for Men."
Tom Haverford,Big night at the Snakehole Lounge!
Tom Haverford,I didn't notice.
Tom Haverford,One second.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I'm just in the middle of a head massage.
Tom Haverford,This is how you eat it!
Tom Haverford,"Please, that was one of the tiny ones."
Tom Haverford,"No, I won't."
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's a good stopping point."
Tom Haverford,"Not cool, at all!"
Tom Haverford,"No, it doesn't!"
Tom Haverford,"Mm, [bleep]."
Tom Haverford,How's the old ticker?
Tom Haverford,Great!
Tom Haverford,Glad to hear it.
Tom Haverford,You guys have got to slow down.
Tom Haverford,Can I just take a rest for a minute?
Tom Haverford,Am I wearing an ascot?
Tom Haverford,There's no chance I can find my way home.
Tom Haverford,"And hey, can you give me a ride after work?"
Tom Haverford,"If that's a coyote, someone needs to pick me up off the ground now."
Tom Haverford,"""And then, my hand accidentally went in the panini press!"""
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Los Angeles, Season One isn't gonna watch itself."
Tom Haverford,"It's not the same, though."
Tom Haverford,I made an iPhone out of paper.
Tom Haverford,Life without screens is pointless.
Tom Haverford,"I'm going crazy, Ron!"
Tom Haverford,You don't deserve the Internet!
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us your idea."
Tom Haverford,No one likes to hear a grown man cry.
Tom Haverford,"What's up, J?"
Tom Haverford,The south part.
Tom Haverford,"Yo, Roomba, drop a beat!"
Tom Haverford,RentASwag is gonna be the opposite of Entertainment720.
Tom Haverford,This is my last chance.
Tom Haverford,"If this goes down in flames, I will have nothing except my looks."
Tom Haverford,I could always pimp myself out to hot older ladies.
Tom Haverford,I need to remember that.
Tom Haverford,The key is crying a lot.
Tom Haverford,Fourth largest coal reserves in the world.
Tom Haverford,I got to bone up.
Tom Haverford,"The last time I was in India, I was eight years old and I stayed inside the whole time playing video games."
Tom Haverford,"One sec, I just got to hit the loo, as those bastard British lmperialists would say."
Tom Haverford,It's sick.
Tom Haverford,I've prayed there.
Tom Haverford,My uncle practically runs the place.
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding?
Tom Haverford,I barely have enough cash to get everything set up.
Tom Haverford,"All right, then relax."
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,Maybe you should see a therapist.
Tom Haverford,Pub is an abbreviation for publicity.
Tom Haverford,"Reason, Jean-Ralphio just started an exclusive, high end production company, and he's willing to put on Li'I Sebastian's memorial service pro bono, just for the pub."
Tom Haverford,"Answer, Tom Haverford."
Tom Haverford,Who's a genius?
Tom Haverford,Question!
Tom Haverford,Might as well lean into it.
Tom Haverford,I gotta buy some sweat pants and a Nicholas Sparks novel.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,I'm back to being a Jerry.
Tom Haverford,It was all for nothing.
Tom Haverford,I have fur underwear.
Tom Haverford,I wear dope suits.
Tom Haverford,I'm a business owner.
Tom Haverford,"It took me 12 years, but I reinvented myself."
Tom Haverford,"First off, double coupon night is an incredible value."
Tom Haverford,"I was a skinny Indian kid in South Carolina, and it sucked."
Tom Haverford,"You don't understand, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, I'm the new Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, ask me if I'm sad."
Tom Haverford,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, 'cause it was featured in Details magazine."
Tom Haverford,"This guy loves the homeless so much, he should marry them, right?"
Tom Haverford,Pfftt!
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, meathead jock type, huh?"
Tom Haverford,Cause your butt's shaped like a cube.
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding me?
Tom Haverford,This is the new intern?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, Donna, who's the new boy toy?"
Tom Haverford,And it's awesome.
Tom Haverford,I already was Jerry.
Tom Haverford,"Secondly, this guy just started a business."
Tom Haverford,He's my friend.
Tom Haverford,It would really help him out.
Tom Haverford,He had the fuel for the eternal flame.
Tom Haverford,No one knows where he is.
Tom Haverford,The maintenance guy bailed on us.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,Coconut just took a dump onstage.
Tom Haverford,Code red.
Tom Haverford,We gotta clean that up.
Tom Haverford,Coconut just took a dump on the stage.
Tom Haverford,Coconut and Ladybug both in position.
Tom Haverford,"Cue music and lights, and Go Ladybug, go Coconut."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Jerry, does this look black to you, too?"
Tom Haverford,"Obsidian, onyx, midnight, lost soul, rolling blackout, sleeping panther, and void by Armani."
Tom Haverford,"Maybe to the layman, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,For the memorial ribbons?
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for coming.
Tom Haverford,"""Leslie!"""
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm gonna oversee everything and make sure it goes great."
Tom Haverford,"Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough? Like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward Bella Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more?"
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I just don't get why you broke up with me.
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not."
Tom Haverford,Bella's going on her first hunt.
Tom Haverford,"Call me a romantic, but I believe by the end of the night, I will have between one and four new girlfriends."
Tom Haverford,That's also my office.
Tom Haverford,"""You rock!"""
Tom Haverford,"""Thank you for supporting the cause of gay marriage."""
Tom Haverford,With eight R's.
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, girrrrrrrrl!"""
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I don't know, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome back, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"""The boys at The Bulge."""
Tom Haverford,I already lent you my car.
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"I'm also a genius, because I'm using the occasion to stock the club with every available hottie I know."
Tom Haverford,"And more importantly, they're usually stupid and terrible."
Tom Haverford,Interns cost nothing to the taxpayer.
Tom Haverford,An intern.
Tom Haverford,Not a person.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, now that Jerry's gone, we need to hire someone to pick up the slack."
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding me?
Tom Haverford,Ronfire of the vanities.
Tom Haverford,"No, I got it."
Tom Haverford,Creating a spectacle.
Tom Haverford,"I gotta admit, his hair game's on point."
Tom Haverford,Gotta find out what kind of product he puts up in his hair.
Tom Haverford,What are you amazing at?
Tom Haverford,It's very good.
Tom Haverford,But yours is also very good.
Tom Haverford,So they get no work done.
Tom Haverford,I got it.
Tom Haverford,"because as of today, his bank account is blowing up."
Tom Haverford,You gotta give it more attitude.
Tom Haverford,It's gotta scare people.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport
Tom Haverford,We're currently coming up with business ideas for Jean-Ralphio
Tom Haverford,"Turn the jet into an apartment building, people could live inside their own private jet."
Tom Haverford,"How about this, you buy a Gulfstream jet, take the wheels off."
Tom Haverford,Or you guys could just stop making fun of me.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Tom Haverford,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport.
Tom Haverford,Game over.
Tom Haverford,Andy's the new Jerry.
Tom Haverford,"I still can't believe you made all that money in the lawsuit, you barely got hurt at all."
Tom Haverford,It's like a Jerry you don't have to pay.
Tom Haverford,you create Pawnee's first and only high end all media entertainment conglomerate.
Tom Haverford,"It means, audio, video, movies, 3D movies, nightclubs, iPhone apps, if its entertainment you're involved."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am a good friend for throwing the party."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I love your idea."
Tom Haverford,I also love your idea.
Tom Haverford,"Two great ideas, two great people."
Tom Haverford,"I don't know which idea's better, but I do know I'll end up on the winning side."
Tom Haverford,Should have never saved his life.
Tom Haverford,Stupid Jerry.
Tom Haverford,What how is that my fault?
Tom Haverford,"When I bet on horses, I never lose."
Tom Haverford,Hard to make fun of that.
Tom Haverford,"Well, pretty heroic, huh, guys?"
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,I bet on all the horses.
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I added the world ""sexiest,"" but we've hired better security."
Tom Haverford,"Okay? Well, what difference does it make? If we stayed together, you probably would have just dumped me for Ron."
Tom Haverford,Great idea!
Tom Haverford,As long as Leslie thinks so as well.
Tom Haverford,And you call it entertainment 720.
Tom Haverford,You gotta stop screaming.
Tom Haverford,because you're willing to go around the world twice for your clients.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know man, I'd have to quit my job."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I think Bobby Newport's bus was in that shot."
Tom Haverford,The statement was that you're very lonely and you need a pet.
Tom Haverford,"Your house just burned down, and you lost all your money in the stock market."
Tom Haverford,"Imagine if your boss was Angelina Jolie, and then one day, she just started dating your ex-boyfriend."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I can't help it, okay? I mean, he's so manly, and he's my boss."
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your final warning."
Tom Haverford,Mine has a collar on it.
Tom Haverford,Do not miss tonight's April Ludgate birthday bash.
Tom Haverford,"9:00 P.M. at the world famous Snakehole Lounge, the place that the Pawnee Jounal has called the sexiest, most dangerous club in town."
Tom Haverford,Wouldn't that freak you out a little bit?
Tom Haverford,There's ink all over him.
Tom Haverford,Do you not know where my car is?
Tom Haverford,Dating MonaLisa is awesome.
Tom Haverford,"Annabel's authentic, hand-strained teat-to-table Beef Milk?"
Tom Haverford,That costs 60 dollars a gallon.
Tom Haverford,"Look, I still don't think we should date."
Tom Haverford,Actually she's not the one in my life I would call crazy.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I say we hear her out."
Tom Haverford,"Well, let's not rush to judgment."
Tom Haverford,We can't keep our hands off each other.
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, MonaLisa."
Tom Haverford,Couldn't afford enough premium carpet to get us to the stage.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, it was a short walk, but it was pretty luxurious, right?"
Tom Haverford,Follow my lead.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, desperation time."
Tom Haverford,We're sweating.
Tom Haverford,We're dancing.
Tom Haverford,Milk costs 3 dollars a gallon.
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm scared!"
Tom Haverford,So we're up in the club.
Tom Haverford,And all I did was call into this radio station and give her a sweet little shoutout.
Tom Haverford,For reals this time.
Tom Haverford,Don't hurt me.
Tom Haverford,Aah!
Tom Haverford,I try not to get involved in other people's personal relationships.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, Ann, this might be a battle you need to fight yourself."
Tom Haverford,She just mixes in water and baby oil.
Tom Haverford,They don't she's had the same bottle for years.
Tom Haverford,Ann broke up with me.
Tom Haverford,What happened to you?
Tom Haverford,Life is garbage.
Tom Haverford,Nothing matters.
Tom Haverford,It doesn't matter.
Tom Haverford,It's me!
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"Annabel, ma cherie."
Tom Haverford,Right down to the unisex linen tunics.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for your help.
Tom Haverford,You earned it.
Tom Haverford,"Anyway, here's your chenille blanket."
Tom Haverford,Why do we keep our petty cash in a clear plastic toilet bowl?
Tom Haverford,"No, this was a sexual injury."
Tom Haverford,Who's this person?
Tom Haverford,It did not go well.
Tom Haverford,Again.
Tom Haverford,I tried.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Jean-Ralphio, who's sitting at my clear purple desk."
Tom Haverford,She then pretends those are ecstasy and sells it to a bunch of college kids that are drinking Goldschlager at a gas station.
Tom Haverford,"She dives in, steals her purse, doesn't go for the money, steals all her birth control pills, and says, ""Bitch, you're gonna get pregnant."""
Tom Haverford,"Eventually, Mona-Lisa threw a cinderblock through the girl's windshield."
Tom Haverford,"Well, Mona-Lisa and the random girl she grabbed after you left got into a fistfight in the parking lot."
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Glad to see you've finally come around after these two minutes of insanity.
Tom Haverford,"Now, will you please consider investing in that toddler cologne I've been bugging you about?"
Tom Haverford,This is exactly what I imagined heaven looks like.
Tom Haverford,Wow!
Tom Haverford,"Or, we go as a team to Hurley's."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I think we can do that for a million."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, we'll talk soon."
Tom Haverford,"There was no one on the other end of that phone call, but soon there will be."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to the Dreamatorium, A.K.A. the headquarters of Entertainment 720."
Tom Haverford,"We got a pool table, a ping-pong table, a couch with a ceiling on it, in-house DJ."
Tom Haverford,DJ Blunt.
Tom Haverford,"And best of all, former NBA superstar Detlef Schrempf is on retainer."
Tom Haverford,"What's up, Detlef?"
Tom Haverford,"Baby, you smell good."
Tom Haverford,Toddler cologne.
Tom Haverford,That would be Hurley's.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm okay."
Tom Haverford,This isn't cool.
Tom Haverford,There was no obstacle too large.
Tom Haverford,He was a horse.
Tom Haverford,"I know, J, but it'd be a big leap."
Tom Haverford,You're the money.
Tom Haverford,And isn't that the point?
Tom Haverford,"Instead, he just brought us joy and happiness."
Tom Haverford,These are questions Li'I Sebastian never had to answer because he was a horse.
Tom Haverford,What is the meaning of all of this?
Tom Haverford,Where are we going in life?
Tom Haverford,Who are we?
Tom Haverford,"Now we have a special presentation, courtesy of the folks at Entertainment 7Twenty."
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,Won't you do it for free?
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, but that's my favorite blankie."
Tom Haverford,No mountain too high.
Tom Haverford,I'll give you that chenille blanket of mine you love so much.
Tom Haverford,She once jumped out of a moving car to buy a Nicki Minaj poster.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, MonaLisa is legit insane."
Tom Haverford,You're proving my point.
Tom Haverford,"Calm down, Ann."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,My girlfriend is crazy.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, I need your help."
Tom Haverford,Congrats.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I just heard that you and Traeger might be getting back together.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, Perkins, sit down."
Tom Haverford,So I guess it's time to do the mature thing and have someone else dump her for me.
Tom Haverford,Except that I live in constant fear for my life.
Tom Haverford,Can you break up with her for me?
Tom Haverford,No valley too low.
Tom Haverford,"Li'I Sebastian had a long life, filled with wonder."
Tom Haverford,"Good night, Li'I Sebastian."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man, that sucks."
Tom Haverford,You're breaking up with me?
Tom Haverford,Are you upset about that?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yeah, super broke."
Tom Haverford,I need someone to guide me.
Tom Haverford,"Wow, that was cool, said some boring idiot from 200 years ago."
Tom Haverford,Who cares about some dumb grandpa and his tin ball? That's the past.
Tom Haverford,Gryzzl is the future.
Tom Haverford,The Newport land will become the Midwest headquarters of America's most dynamic technology company.
Tom Haverford,My gut is really small and easily irritated.
Tom Haverford,I can't tell you what to do.
Tom Haverford,Do I stay here or roll the dice with JeanRalphio?
Tom Haverford,"So what do I do, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Leave it messy.
Tom Haverford,"Man, those two really hate each other."
Tom Haverford,"That feud is, like, Biggie Tupac level."
Tom Haverford,Maybe even Morgan Freeman Shailene Woodley level.
Tom Haverford,Forever.
Tom Haverford,You don't need to bring anything but your gorgeous body.
Tom Haverford,"And get this: cover charge is normally 15 dollars. Say my name at the door, it's 13.50."

Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self.
Tom Haverford,In Beverly Hills!
Tom Haverford,How?
Tom Haverford,Time to get those old ladies to do my work for me.
Tom Haverford,I gotta get out of here pronto.
Tom Haverford,How many more of those stupid documents do you have to scan?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man! Yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Wake up, Pawnee! Tommy Timberlake is in the house! And you know who else is with me? Detlef Schrempf! Tell them what they won, son!"
Tom Haverford,What's up!
Tom Haverford,I just moved.
Tom Haverford,"One time my refrigerator stopped working, I didn't know what to do."
Tom Haverford,I don't know how either of you guys are doing this.
Tom Haverford,Our favorite.
Tom Haverford,I'm hungry.
Tom Haverford,"You want to come up and play video games? Whoa! Pull over, man."
Tom Haverford,"Detlef, are you sure you don't want me to drive? I'm good to drive."
Tom Haverford,"Turn my swag on, Took a look in the mirror, said, ""What's up?"""
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, especially with that heterosexual cowboy greeting us on the way in."
Tom Haverford,There's a bar on Eighth Street called Pitchers and Catchers.
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self in Beverly Hills
Tom Haverford,Usher's house!
Tom Haverford,Usher's star!
Tom Haverford,Uh Treat yo' self.
Tom Haverford,LASIK for fingernails?
Tom Haverford,I came up with that.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Laser my nails off, please."
Tom Haverford,You can go there.
Tom Haverford,That place has good chicken.
Tom Haverford,"Things, Donna!"
Tom Haverford,Things.
Tom Haverford,Today is about one thing.
Tom Haverford,"Alright, the good news is, there's only two pieces of bad news."
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Tom Haverford,"The bad news is, none of our ads aired and we cannot get our money back."
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,By shining down on them with the Haverford charm ray.
Tom Haverford,"Ann, do you want me to liven things up or not?"
Tom Haverford,But I can't wait to hear your new ideas.
Tom Haverford,I love them already.
Tom Haverford,"Ooh, I'm hungry."
Tom Haverford,Tommy needs a mango.
Tom Haverford,See ya.
Tom Haverford,Looking out for number one.
Tom Haverford,Always smart.
Tom Haverford,"So, how is post-breakup life?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, you should come with me."
Tom Haverford,Who could live like this?
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Tom Haverford,All we're talking about is treating yo' self.
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,"Let's hit it, Donna."
Tom Haverford,"So, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I literally couldn't care less.
Tom Haverford,"Whatever, just text me when you decide."
Tom Haverford,Leslie said she'd pay me 100 bucks.
Tom Haverford,You should come to the wedding... And do paperwork.
Tom Haverford,He brought his own whale blubber to light the lamps.
Tom Haverford,That's what you should do.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,"Maybe it's just even, you know, boss, employee type thing."
Tom Haverford,Maybe we just go as work friends.
Tom Haverford,"As, like, a plus-one type thing."
Tom Haverford,"Man, Garth is a machine."
Tom Haverford,If it isn't Ethel Beavers.
Tom Haverford,I had much better things to do.
Tom Haverford,"Bye, pups! Bye, little piggies!"
Tom Haverford,"Small claims court, divorce filings, stateordered drug tests."
Tom Haverford,"Great, obviously."
Tom Haverford,Bedazzled that elbow.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, before you say anything."
Tom Haverford,I don't think you should go to Donna's wedding to supervise catering.
Tom Haverford,"I want you to come with me, as my date."
Tom Haverford,"The thing is, you work for me, so it's probably kind of uncool for me to even ask."
Tom Haverford,Which is why I signed these documents transferring day-to-day operations of Tom's Bistro over to Craig.
Tom Haverford,He'll be your boss now.
Tom Haverford,Not me.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I do."
Tom Haverford,"You're great at your job, and I want you working here forever, and if you don't have feelings for me, I need you to know that everything is gonna be fine."
Tom Haverford,"In fact, forget it."
Tom Haverford,I wasn't even serious.
Tom Haverford,It's somehow both freezing and humid.
Tom Haverford,You've been hoaxed! You've been Tommy-ed!
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,"Craig, never mind."
Tom Haverford,You can rip these papers up.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,I'd better get back there.
Tom Haverford,The fourth floor.
Tom Haverford,"But the other 2%, it's stuff like this kid."
Tom Haverford,"If Leslie's taught me anything, it's that yes, this job is frustrating and you hit brick walls."
Tom Haverford,And this little puppy has a home.
Tom Haverford,"Because you worked hard, this little terribly-dressed girl has a puppy."
Tom Haverford,Let me show you something.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yes."
Tom Haverford,"Warm it up, please."
Tom Haverford,Ooh!
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,There's a whole room on the fourth floor where they store the knives they've confiscated from people who went to the fourth floor to stab someone.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, this is you."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,#NAME?
Tom Haverford,What what is that photo? That must come preloaded in there or something.
Tom Haverford,This is the hottest restaurant in LA.

Tom Haverford,All the sushi is made from fish previously owned by celebrities.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"It's like, just be new."
Tom Haverford,Old things are dumb.
Tom Haverford,Everything is old.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're not supposed to get me anything."
Tom Haverford,This is your special day.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, damn."
Tom Haverford,"I was secretly hoping you got me the shoes Jaden Smith wears in Hitch 2, Son of a Hitch."
Tom Haverford,She works for me.
Tom Haverford,She uprooted her whole life to move to Pawnee for this job.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to make it weird.
Tom Haverford,"Ethel, this shirt is from Theory."
Tom Haverford,Name tags make holes.
Tom Haverford,I'm not wearing this.
Tom Haverford,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,Remind me next time to ask her where she was when Lincoln got shot.
Tom Haverford,And that puppy.
Tom Haverford,Definitely didn't volunteer.
Tom Haverford,That's the most baller thing I've ever seen!
Tom Haverford,Josh Groban!
Tom Haverford,That's an even better gift!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, snap!"
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna, it's a great gift."
Tom Haverford,What if I'm the only one that caught feelings?
Tom Haverford,And what if she says no?
Tom Haverford,He's eating his own sushi!
Tom Haverford,You expect that to catch on?
Tom Haverford,"What's up, beautiful?"
Tom Haverford,It's true.
Tom Haverford,"What, you're done?"
Tom Haverford,"Lucy is visiting her boyfriend, Conrad, in Chicago."
Tom Haverford,So I'm just trying to distract myself with work so I don't think about the marathon bone sex they're probably having.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, this says they only pay you 100 bucks a week?"
Tom Haverford,This is perfect.
Tom Haverford,I'll be your agent.
Tom Haverford,I'll put all my energy into renegotiating your contract.
Tom Haverford,Who are we gonna make fun of now?
Tom Haverford,This is a sad day.
Tom Haverford,I won't even think about Lucy and Conrad and his stupid crunches that he probably does.
Tom Haverford,I should probably do some crunches.
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,"Andy, my tumtum!"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, guys."
Tom Haverford,"It's a red and white heirloom red bean pasta, with an imported Tuscan walnut herb sauce infused with shaved heritage Pecorino Romano."
Tom Haverford,"Listen, I've never seen this before, so I'd really appreciate it if no one, like, talked or texted or anything."
Tom Haverford,I love it.
Tom Haverford,Stop it!
Tom Haverford,"Stop laughing, Muriel."
Tom Haverford,"Why you gotta be like that, Ethel?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, great."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, sorry to interrupt the love fest, but can you hand me that folder there, please, Ethel?"
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Dude, what did I just say?"
Tom Haverford,"Great job, bud."
Tom Haverford,Jerry was here?
Tom Haverford,You crushed it.
Tom Haverford,I love being Andy's agent.
Tom Haverford,"He does all the work, and I get 10% just for showing up."
Tom Haverford,"It's like a chef at a restaurant making all the food and then the owner gets the profit, which is my other job."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, yes."
Tom Haverford,"New dish we're working on, tell me what you think."
Tom Haverford,Fantastic.
Tom Haverford,I love it.
Tom Haverford,"All I have to do is wait for a textbook Dwyer screwup, which usually happens, mm, every 20 minutes."
Tom Haverford,Check.
Tom Haverford,Goofy?
Tom Haverford,Check.
Tom Haverford,Big guy?
Tom Haverford,It's Andy.
Tom Haverford,And it's not me.
Tom Haverford,"There's a natural successor to Jerry's sad, smelly crown."
Tom Haverford,Bobby.
Tom Haverford,"Starting now, when life gives me lemons, I'm gonna slice them up into wedges and throw them into vodka tonics, which I will then sip in a burlesque nightclub that I co-own with actor Taye Diggs and two of the Pussycat Dolls."
Tom Haverford,So maybe it's time for a change.
Tom Haverford,It's too sweet and it makes my tongue feel gritty.
Tom Haverford,I don't want lemonade.
Tom Haverford,How are you so happy working here?
Tom Haverford,Who's that from?
Tom Haverford,It's already started.

Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,Andy's show gets huge ratings in three cities.

Tom Haverford,Do you want to talk about it?
Tom Haverford,He deserved it.
Tom Haverford,Uh Settle in.
Tom Haverford,Because I have some very strong feelings about this.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,"And, two, will you please invite me to your 30th birthday party?"

Tom Haverford,And he responds to them.
Tom Haverford,The only ones he gets are spam.
Tom Haverford,He hasn't gotten an email in 12 days. Is he a ghost?
Tom Haverford,"Now, granted, ""Butler of Honor"" is a term I made up, but it's not a job I take lightly."
Tom Haverford,"Closed a bunch of deals, did a bunch of crunchesâ¦"
Tom Haverford,"Weird couple of days for me, too."
Tom Haverford,How was the trip?

Tom Haverford,"Eh, be nice to Chenille O'Neal."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks a lot, Forbes magazine."

Tom Haverford,"April, what do you think?"
Tom Haverford,That is appealing.
Tom Haverford,We would all basically double our investments.
Tom Haverford,"Someone I'm not saying Diddy, but I'm not not saying Diddy has offered to buy out RentASwag for a buttload of money."

Tom Haverford,Thank God.
Tom Haverford,This isn't yours?
Tom Haverford,So you're not pregnant?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, excuse me, miss Hanley? Do you mind if I snap a you-ie? It's what I call selfies of other people."

Tom Haverford,"I could add a baby section over there, call it ""Li'l Swaggers."""
Tom Haverford,"If it keeps up like this, I would leave the Parks Department and do RentASwag fulltime, maybe even expand."
Tom Haverford,Business is booming.
Tom Haverford,Let's pay for it.
Tom Haverford,This looks dope.
Tom Haverford,"If you go at more than a brisk walk, it will fall apart."

Tom Haverford,Restaurant superstition-- breaking a glass on the first night is good luck.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, everything is perfect."

Tom Haverford,"And despite what my pocket square says, I'm not a billionaire."
Tom Haverford,So I quit.
Tom Haverford,"Just go home, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,I love quitting.
Tom Haverford,"When I was a kid and things didn't go my way, I would just take my ball and go home."
Tom Haverford,"That's better than winning, 'cause then your friends can't play anymore."

Tom Haverford,Maybe speed it up a little?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, but also, go faster."

Tom Haverford,"April, you list all the menu items from memory."
Tom Haverford,It'll be classier anyway.
Tom Haverford,Ron!
Tom Haverford,What was wrong with that one?
Tom Haverford,And I thought I had a friend.
Tom Haverford,It's almost too easy.
Tom Haverford,"I know you can, Ben."
Tom Haverford,That's how easy it is.
Tom Haverford,"What the hell, man?"
Tom Haverford,This looks exactly like my store!
Tom Haverford,How's it going?
Tom Haverford,"Your mysterious, unnamed client seems like a pretty intense guy."
Tom Haverford,He must be one heck of a transporter.
Tom Haverford,Some mysterious big shot investor has opened up a store directly across the street from rentaswag to try to put me out of business.
Tom Haverford,"I'm not worried, though."
Tom Haverford,I've poured my heart and soul into my store.
Tom Haverford,I'm sure this guy's just looking for a place to store all his NBA championship trophies.
Tom Haverford,Damn.
Tom Haverford,I am impressed by how quickly he was able to move such a large amount of merchandise.
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, dude, wake up, man."
Tom Haverford,But real talk we're both men about town being constantly bombarded with party invitations.
Tom Haverford,"My friend who's opening a restaurant tonight, and you're going to be there, cousin, unless you want me to get onstage and talk about how we used to take baths together, how you cried whenever I took away your rubber duckies."
Tom Haverford,There's a second book?
Tom Haverford,"Guys, this is the most important night of my life, which means it's the most important night of your lives too."
Tom Haverford,It's opening night.
Tom Haverford,Let's do this!
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Your father ruined my last business.
Tom Haverford,Why would you bring him here?
Tom Haverford,"Why would you come here, Saperstein?"
Tom Haverford,Maybe this restaurant won't be a huge success.
Tom Haverford,Maybe it won't be packed with celebrities.
Tom Haverford,Or maybe it will.
Tom Haverford,"Hello, Joan."
Tom Haverford,No joke.
Tom Haverford,"Hello, Perd."
Tom Haverford,Can I get you a drink?
Tom Haverford,"Steve, can we get these cocktails going for Joan and Perd? Oh, look, Kay Hanley, rock star, thanks for coming by."
Tom Haverford,"Come on in, guys."
Tom Haverford,"You might want to grab a seat, Dr. Saperstein."
Tom Haverford,Looks like it's getting a little crowded.
Tom Haverford,"And I said, ""you don't need a towel."""
Tom Haverford,"""You need a washcloth."""
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Tom Haverford,This is amazing.
Tom Haverford,"Practically everyone we invited came, except for Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus."
Tom Haverford,I was hoping tonight would be magical enough to get 'em back together.
Tom Haverford,No way.
Tom Haverford,I'm not gonna let you take another one of my businesses.
Tom Haverford,"You know what? I'm not really looking for investors, given the almost embarrassing level of success I've attained, but I'll consider it."
Tom Haverford,Thanks for coming by.
Tom Haverford,"Ginuwine, it is an honor to be breathing the same air as you."
Tom Haverford,"Anyway, Tom's Bistro, tonight, be there."
Tom Haverford,You gots to stop by.
Tom Haverford,Twilight is dope.
Tom Haverford,I couldn't put it down.
Tom Haverford,The opening of Tom's Bistro was a disaster.
Tom Haverford,So what?
Tom Haverford,This is America.
Tom Haverford,"And America's the land of second chances, and now we have one night, one afterparty to make the world realize that Tom's Bistro is where miracles can happen!"
Tom Haverford,"I know, and I didn't want to do this, but I called in some reinforcements."
Tom Haverford,It's 9:00 in the morningâ¦
Tom Haverford,It's not a fourway.
Tom Haverford,And I need your help.
Tom Haverford,Take these V.I.P. invitations.
Tom Haverford,"Find all the ""A"" list peeps at the concert and get 'em to the restaurant tonight."
Tom Haverford,I got to stop by the Parks office.
Tom Haverford,I'll meet you later.
Tom Haverford,Godspeed.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, can I have a burger?"
Tom Haverford,I'm hungry.
Tom Haverford,"Joanie baby, I'm throwing a huge party tonight at Tom's Bistro."
Tom Haverford,We had a new founders day statue commissioned and added your name to the list of founders of Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,That makes what we're about to show you a little bit awkward.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,So I just wanted to let you know I will not be selling Rent-A-Swag.
Tom Haverford,And you can go tell your client he now has 100 problems?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Is it Jay-Z?
Tom Haverford,But that's my idea and my name.
Tom Haverford,So it's not free?
Tom Haverford,"This sucks, but I have to admit: It's a pretty baller move."
Tom Haverford,You sure this isn't Diddy?
Tom Haverford,I knew it!
Tom Haverford,It was like she was peering into my soul.
Tom Haverford,Across the street? What kind of store is it gonna be?
Tom Haverford,"Do I share his concerns about turning Bella, though?"
Tom Haverford,Absolutely not.
Tom Haverford,"We gotta run, Les."
Tom Haverford,"34C, 36B, 34B, 34D. 32A? How did you get in here?"
Tom Haverford,Watch.
Tom Haverford,You don't believe me?
Tom Haverford,And may I say that you look even more beautiful now than you did when you won the crown.
Tom Haverford,I recognized you right away.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, ladies, is there anything you desire at all, besides me?"
Tom Haverford,Looking amazing.
Tom Haverford,How long has it been?
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,How are the kids?
Tom Haverford,"Donna, you look amazing."
Tom Haverford,Let's just say it's too hard to explain.
Tom Haverford,What exactly do we do?
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 is just a little multinational entertainment company that I started with my boy Jean-Ralphio.
Tom Haverford,I'm just kidding.
Tom Haverford,Branded mouse pad?
Tom Haverford,Tommy Haverford back in the Parks Department.
Tom Haverford,High levels of swagger coming through.
Tom Haverford,Warning!
Tom Haverford,"I gotta say, hanging out with Lucy's been so fun."
Tom Haverford,She's the best.
Tom Haverford,"I dunno, she lives here."
Tom Haverford,How would it even work?
Tom Haverford,It's just us right now.
Tom Haverford,Do you really think you're moving here?
Tom Haverford,Hey! You remembered my size!
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Lucy, can I ask you something?"
Tom Haverford,"I was wondering would you wanna maybe... Come work for me in Pawnee? I got the company and it's growing so fast, I can't do it all myself."
Tom Haverford,"And I need a manager, and you're a perfect candidate."
Tom Haverford,"Entertainment 720 hockey jersey, anybody?"
Tom Haverford,"You're perfect, each and every one of you."
Tom Haverford,God bless.
Tom Haverford,"I'm serious, though."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,You can't not talk to someone for five years and then show up unannounced where they work in a different city.
Tom Haverford,That's what murderers do before they murder someone.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, uh--"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,I'm here doin' stuff.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,That's the deal.
Tom Haverford,"No, he's working at a nonprofit."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, that sounds great."
Tom Haverford,We'll go a little Chicago deep dish pizza.
Tom Haverford,And go watch the Bears.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry I started doing that.
Tom Haverford,"Harvest, like, a half hour later."
Tom Haverford,Plant the seed.
Tom Haverford,Classic game.
Tom Haverford,So you always remember me and the first time we met.
Tom Haverford,Are you into me?
Tom Haverford,"Looks like we got a frontrunner, guys!"
Tom Haverford,"Here we have Leslie's custom scorecard, with categories such as, presentation, intelligence, knowledge of ""herstory"", fruitful gestures, je ne sais quoi, and something called ""The Naomi Wolf Factor."""
Tom Haverford,My girl Trish is talented.
Tom Haverford,"And I'm reading this, and I'm like, ""How could they hurt those gorillas like that?"""
Tom Haverford,"You can watch Hitch 2 anytime, anywhere!"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, of course! This is all perfect, and everything's worked out just as I'd hoped."
Tom Haverford,"Gryzzl came in, they gave everyone free tablets and WiFi and phones."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I'm texting Trish to tell her how good she did earlier.
Tom Haverford,"They're such gentle, magnificent creatures, you know?"
Tom Haverford,I'm an animal lover.
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I want you to keep this bottle cap."
Tom Haverford,There's a ton of new businesses.
Tom Haverford,"Let's just get something to eat, and fly home."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"But if you don't call in favors to look at women in bikinis and assign them numerical grades, what the hell do you call in favors for?"
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Good idea.
Tom Haverford,We need a celebrity as a minority owner.
Tom Haverford,It will strengthen Gryzzl's bid.
Tom Haverford,"Since we're locals, they want us to think of ideas--"
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,She is crazy hot.
Tom Haverford,Give me some of Tommy's ribs.
Tom Haverford,Look her up on the government website.
Tom Haverford,This chick's name is Ann Perkins.
Tom Haverford,That's good.
Tom Haverford,Kind of.
Tom Haverford,Let's just say we got to second that night.
Tom Haverford,Jean-Ralphio.
Tom Haverford,Perd Hapley.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford?
Tom Haverford,"That's nice, but I don't know if you can really consider me a celebrity."
Tom Haverford,"These are all great options, but I think we need to go after Pawnee's biggest fish."
Tom Haverford,Annabel Porter from Bloosh.
Tom Haverford,We're living the dream.
Tom Haverford,"First you set up the pond, then you real in the fish."
Tom Haverford,"So why don't you head over there and do your thing? We want people to see you when they come in, Detlef."
Tom Haverford,Yes! Thank you!
Tom Haverford,We hired you to look pretty and shoot baskets.
Tom Haverford,"If I see this at one picnic, I swear--"
Tom Haverford,And keep it out of direct sunlight.
Tom Haverford,But we didn't hire you to give us business advice.
Tom Haverford,I'm dead serious.
Tom Haverford,Never use a lint roller.
Tom Haverford,Crazy Ira and the Douche.
Tom Haverford,Isn't that great?
Tom Haverford,Come here.
Tom Haverford,Aah!
Tom Haverford,I had to call in a few favors.
Tom Haverford,I know a guy.
Tom Haverford,Guess who's also gonna be a judge in the beauty pageant?
Tom Haverford,Peace.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you so much, I owe you."
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,Tell them they already have another Asian judge.
Tom Haverford,Just bump that clown.
Tom Haverford,I hope you all know I was instrumental in getting Trish crowned Miss Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,You don't care about things.
Tom Haverford,What do you know?
Tom Haverford,I guess she's just afraid of how powerful her feelings are.
Tom Haverford,I complimented you.
Tom Haverford,"No, you don't."
Tom Haverford,Do not go to the Glitter Factory.
Tom Haverford,What's disgusting is the Glitter Factory.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Tom Haverford,You get to be a judge in that thing?
Tom Haverford,But I want to be a judge.
Tom Haverford,"So far, so good."
Tom Haverford,I always just put six.
Tom Haverford,"I still don't know what ""claiming allowances"" means."
Tom Haverford,What was your talent again?
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's do this."
Tom Haverford,Talent and Poise.
Tom Haverford,It's the strip club by the VA hospital.
Tom Haverford,I have some meetings there.
Tom Haverford,You're smart and qualified and we're totally lucky to have you.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,The girls from Talent and Poise gonna be there?
Tom Haverford,We must've given the cabbie the address.
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's where Lucy works."
Tom Haverford,We're going back home.
Tom Haverford,"Fifty more copies, please."
Tom Haverford,"To make it up to you, I'd like to read you the speech now."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Craig."
Tom Haverford,Matter of time.
Tom Haverford,"""I've known a lot of ballers in my day."""
Tom Haverford,"So far, none of them have shown up."
Tom Haverford,"Just come by, go for a dip, whenever you want."
Tom Haverford,I just happened to have a spare.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I'm constantly giving one of my keys.
Tom Haverford,This is one of my favorite pick-up strategies.
Tom Haverford,"Just come by, grill up whatever you want."
Tom Haverford,Take a key.
Tom Haverford,"Look, let me do you a favor."
Tom Haverford,"But when I got up there, I got pretty emotional."
Tom Haverford,"If you guys like grilling, you want to come over and use my grill--"
Tom Haverford,"""He's kind."""
Tom Haverford,"""He's intelligent."""
Tom Haverford,"""He's a person I'm deeply proud to call my friend."""
Tom Haverford,"That is an amazing idea, and I will buy it from you, but never do that again."
Tom Haverford,That was really expensive moisturizer.
Tom Haverford,"Well, then, I did you a huge favor, because they stink."
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Uhhuh.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"We're stronger than ever, so"
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna."
Tom Haverford,Yep.
Tom Haverford,The end of a relationship.
Tom Haverford,And the beginning of a partnership.
Tom Haverford,"""But no man balls harder than the man I'm about to bring up."""
Tom Haverford,I have been robbed twice.
Tom Haverford,"I was gonna talk about how I owe you so much, and how you stood by me through all of my failures, and I stood by you through all of your terrible outfits."
Tom Haverford,I asked them if I could do it.
Tom Haverford,Sorry for totally crushing it and you in the process.
Tom Haverford,Later.
Tom Haverford,Good evening and welcome to the Pawnee Bicentennial Gala.
Tom Haverford,"Not long ago, this town was barely on the map."
Tom Haverford,Unless you're talking about a map of the cities with the most obese pets.
Tom Haverford,But then one great man came along and he lifted all of us up.
Tom Haverford,And that man was me.
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, owner and proprietor of the effortlessly chic, celebrity packed Italian restaurant, Tom's Bistro."
Tom Haverford,And several other establishments.
Tom Haverford,"People come up to me, and they say things like, ""Tom, given all that you've accomplished, is it hard to stay humble?"""
Tom Haverford,"And I say, ""Not for me."""
Tom Haverford,"""I'm pretty amazing at being humble."""
Tom Haverford,But enough about me.
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Pawnee's Man of the Year 2017, Mr. Ben Wyatt."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, stop it."
Tom Haverford,He's drooling on me!
Tom Haverford,By Jacob?
Tom Haverford,Truth is they didn't ask me to introduce you.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"But, you know, when it comes to inspirational Will Smith quotes, how you gonna stop at 10?"
Tom Haverford,"What up, playa? I just wanted to apologize for my intro running long."
Tom Haverford,Ann!
Tom Haverford,About to get some peddies!
Tom Haverford,"So, I'm thinking, in addition, to the Tom's Bistros, we have a hyper exclusive lounge area called Tommy's Lounge."
Tom Haverford,Let's hit it.
Tom Haverford,"And then I said, ""Uh, you might wanna check with the penguin."""
Tom Haverford,Sometimes I think she's in the Volturi.
Tom Haverford,I don't really have any power in this relationship.
Tom Haverford,I'll think of ideas in the tree.
Tom Haverford,Ann what the hell?
Tom Haverford,The Volturi?
Tom Haverford,"All right, Donna."
Tom Haverford,"Let's talk ""Sparkle Skin."""
Tom Haverford,Do we know anyone in product development over at Sephora?
Tom Haverford,Die Hard.
Tom Haverford,"""Let's catch up soon."""
Tom Haverford,"""Miss you."""
Tom Haverford,Andy?
Tom Haverford,Think about what you're saying right now.
Tom Haverford,'Cause it's the smartest idea anyone's ever had!
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Tom Haverford,Pun intended.
Tom Haverford,Let's go back out there.
Tom Haverford,It's Trish.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Susan Boring Stories?
Tom Haverford,That's a baller move.
Tom Haverford,Respect.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,"The hot one, by a landslide."
Tom Haverford,We're all in agreement.
Tom Haverford,"So, how long do we have to pretend to deliberate until we go back out there?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I have a question for the hot one."
Tom Haverford,"First off, I just want to say I'm a little bit surprised, because I didn't think angels could fly so low."
Tom Haverford,"You truly are a beautiful, beautiful woman."
Tom Haverford,You're funny.
Tom Haverford,You're funny.
Tom Haverford,Turn the car around.
Tom Haverford,"""Hey Tom, saw the article, you boss!"""
Tom Haverford,This is so dumb!
Tom Haverford,"Sir, where the hell are we?"
Tom Haverford,Did I give you a bottle cap?
Tom Haverford,"Excuse me, did I give you a bottle cap?"
Tom Haverford,Did I give any of you guys a bottle cap?
Tom Haverford,You sure?
Tom Haverford,Who the [bleep] did I give a bottle cap to?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no!"
Tom Haverford,That smells nice.
Tom Haverford,I was super into her.
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to the party, pal."
Tom Haverford,It's Officer John McClane.
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well, look who's here."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man!"
Tom Haverford,It's pretty good.
Tom Haverford,"It will erase your credit cards, guaranteed."
Tom Haverford,So don't put it in your wallet.
Tom Haverford,It's also a strong magnet.
Tom Haverford,It's the coolest possible color scheme.
Tom Haverford,"Black print, black background."
Tom Haverford,"And if you wanna live yours, here's my card."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm living mine."
Tom Haverford,Are you living your dreams?
Tom Haverford,Let me ask you this.
Tom Haverford,It's my company!
Tom Haverford,I think there might be a place for you over at Entertainment720.
Tom Haverford,You can lift heavy things.
Tom Haverford,That's my dad!
Tom Haverford,That's my cousin.
Tom Haverford,I need someone to share my life with.
Tom Haverford,"I must be the first person ever to have money, power, and notoriety, but still feel empty."
Tom Haverford,"Andrew my mandrew, what are you up to?"
Tom Haverford,"Andy, I'm gonna be honest."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, we used to date."
Tom Haverford,I came here today to talk to you.
Tom Haverford,You're hardworking.
Tom Haverford,I need to find someone.
Tom Haverford,"I'm tired of being an ""Entrepreneur/bachelor."""
Tom Haverford,That's the fourth engagement this month.
Tom Haverford,"Round of drinks for everyone, on the house!"
Tom Haverford,It means it's a cause for celebration.
Tom Haverford,"Now look, you're enthusiastic."
Tom Haverford,"All right, see you later."
Tom Haverford,You both really blew this.
Tom Haverford,And guess what I have planned for tonight.
Tom Haverford,"No, but that definitely didn't help."
Tom Haverford,"Grab Jean-Ralphio, and get these three things."
Tom Haverford,And meet me at the Snakehole Lounge in 30 minutes.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no!"
Tom Haverford,Go!
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,I didn't ask for flavored condoms.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,"No time to explain, Les, but don't worry, I have a plan."
Tom Haverford,You wanna stay and hide and watch the proposal?
Tom Haverford,Verbena-scented soy candles!
Tom Haverford,The Snakehole Lounge is where we first met.
Tom Haverford,"On our first date, I gave you a single daisy, like this."
Tom Haverford,And after that we ate late night pancakes at J.J's.
Tom Haverford,"And while we were there, I pulled out a deck of cards, and I tried to show you a magic trick I learned on a David Blaine special."
Tom Haverford,"Unsurprisingly, I failed, and you made fun of me, ruthlessly."
Tom Haverford,"I haven't done this trick in a while, but I think I'm ready to try it again."
Tom Haverford,Pick a card.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no."
Tom Haverford,Go a little bit over to the left.
Tom Haverford,There you go.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,Yay!
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait, Ron! Stop!"
Tom Haverford,And you said no? Are you insane?
Tom Haverford,Sorry about the audible.
Tom Haverford,I just realized Lucy doesn't care about all that flashy stuff.
Tom Haverford,That's not the way to her heart.
Tom Haverford,"Frankly, I'm stunned she's still even into me."
Tom Haverford,It's all wrong.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, what the hell? Don't do it."
Tom Haverford,We're calling this off.
Tom Haverford,And you've lost it.
Tom Haverford,I'm throwing a huge cocktail party tomorrow for all my best clients.
Tom Haverford,Why are you doing an accent?
Tom Haverford,I think MonaLisa's stealing from me.
Tom Haverford,There's 60 dollars missing from the register.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you have one line."
Tom Haverford,I've got this.
Tom Haverford,I'll take that one.
Tom Haverford,The most expensive one.
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz!
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,I want you to meet my wife.
Tom Haverford,"Lucy, your mission, should you choose to accept it is, to marry me."
Tom Haverford,Look at how hot she is.
Tom Haverford,Isn't that crazy?
Tom Haverford,And she's a surgeon.
Tom Haverford,She makes a ton of money!
Tom Haverford,Bam!
Tom Haverford,"Wait, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I guess you can go."
Tom Haverford,I kinda need you to stay.
Tom Haverford,"Um, store's really busy."
Tom Haverford,Got to keep it in the family.
Tom Haverford,Of course.
Tom Haverford,"This is MonaLisa Saperstein, my new sales associate."
Tom Haverford,Which they never will.
Tom Haverford,These kids are renting my old clothes like they're going out of style.
Tom Haverford,"RentASwag shareholders: As you can see, your store is hoppin'."
Tom Haverford,I'm really glad you were here to help me with all this today.
Tom Haverford,"You've always been there for me, and I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're pretty cool."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, there's Lucy."
Tom Haverford,Can we go?
Tom Haverford,She doesn't love you.
Tom Haverford,There's an iPod touch in here.
Tom Haverford,"So, as you all know--"
Tom Haverford,Great work today.
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, forgot the oysters."
Tom Haverford,"Great job, team."
Tom Haverford,I'm outtie.
Tom Haverford,But I'm sure the doctors or giraffes or whatever you decided to help will be thrilled with the whatever you decided to whatever.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm terribly disappointed."
Tom Haverford,These smoothies will just blend themselves!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, Ben!"
Tom Haverford,"Hi, I'm Thomas Montgomery Haverford."
Tom Haverford,It's Tom! And I'm not lying.
Tom Haverford,I'm not gonna let you destroy Ron.
Tom Haverford,They had a valet.
Tom Haverford,"What was that, booboo?"
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,Who's your friend?
Tom Haverford,You're just gonna have to-- Ow! Ow!
Tom Haverford,Can you pass the bonbons?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,That's my pick.
Tom Haverford,It's called the Clean Sheet Foundation.
Tom Haverford,I got a good one.
Tom Haverford,"Um, yeah."
Tom Haverford,What would our last ride be without one more bureaucratic snafu?
Tom Haverford,"Don't worry, booboo."
Tom Haverford,"Tommy will solve this problem, no sweat."
Tom Haverford,Sensor.
Tom Haverford,Don't forget well-dressed.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, George Gernway."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"The gentleman over by the bar there sent you over this glass of wine, and his business card."
Tom Haverford,"Nice crooning, buddy."
Tom Haverford,"Weirdly, so far, no one has noticed."
Tom Haverford,"I think Lucy probably wants to hang, just the two of us."
Tom Haverford,"I'll see you later, Jennifer Knope-ez."
Tom Haverford,Did you guys get your public forum gift bag?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, not bad."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I really don't think you have to worry about them abandoning you once they get married.
Tom Haverford,Can I try the andouille sausage?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll change it up this time.
Tom Haverford,They drove over here and cut you down from a gate.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I do, okay? When I asked her to be my date, she cackled for a full minute and said, and I quote, ""Anything to make Ron miserable."""
Tom Haverford,"It's not real, man."
Tom Haverford,Or Ann and Jessica with me watching.
Tom Haverford,I don't have time to find someone new.
Tom Haverford,Or me and Jessica.
Tom Haverford,I should be the one that's upset.
Tom Haverford,Really? Why does that bother you?
Tom Haverford,She's just messing with you.
Tom Haverford,"No offense, but I think the normal grieving time for gazebo destruction has passed."
Tom Haverford,Been making some modifications to the pace car.
Tom Haverford,"Speaker system, Mad Men bar, iPad dock, and bam!"
Tom Haverford,Orange racing stripe.
Tom Haverford,It's a perfect recreation of Han Lue's Nissan in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift.
Tom Haverford,"I think I'm gonna go with the porcini mushrooms and boursin, s'il vous plait."
Tom Haverford,"Decisions, decisions."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Garry."
Tom Haverford,You're the mayor now.
Tom Haverford,Have some dignity.
Tom Haverford,Look how pretty the people are.
Tom Haverford,It was supposed to be me and Ann.
Tom Haverford,This sucks.
Tom Haverford,"You listen to me, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."
Tom Haverford,You'll have the banner done.
Tom Haverford,Suspicious.
Tom Haverford,"Huh, that's weird, how'd you even know it was broken?"
Tom Haverford,"So, rock."
Tom Haverford,Look at Ben.
Tom Haverford,Don't look at me.
Tom Haverford,Time well spent.
Tom Haverford,"""Let's Dia-beat-this."""
Tom Haverford,"""Diabetes."""
Tom Haverford,You stayed up all night the night before an all night telethon.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,Andy finished his twomile run in 29 minutes and 43 seconds.
Tom Haverford,That ruins sex and tonight.
Tom Haverford,It's Jerry's sex night.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,"Hang in there, pal."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna drive around.
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,Perfect!
Tom Haverford,See?
Tom Haverford,Here you go.
Tom Haverford,We're together now.
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know, we're back at my place, having sex."
Tom Haverford,Hard.
Tom Haverford,We started making out.
Tom Haverford,"For some reason, she got super turned on."
Tom Haverford,Um yeah.
Tom Haverford,Gross!
Tom Haverford,"I told her she needed to change her attitude, or I was gonna have to fire her."
Tom Haverford,From when to when?
Tom Haverford,"That's okay, Andy, I think I'm gonna keep my distance."
Tom Haverford,I need you guys to come to the Snakehole Lounge tonight to help me with something.
Tom Haverford,Please.
Tom Haverford,This is important.
Tom Haverford,That was weird.
Tom Haverford,I'm just gonna see where this roller coaster goes.
Tom Haverford,She's sexy.
Tom Haverford,I'm young.
Tom Haverford,"I know she's kind of a monster, but whatever."
Tom Haverford,"Wow, it's like a sweaty pinata."
Tom Haverford,"It's the small victories, you know?"
Tom Haverford,I think I'm gradually transforming her from truly terrible to only kinda terrible.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Tom Haverford,"Or else it's over between us, you understand?"
Tom Haverford,That's the deal.
Tom Haverford,"When we're together, you can't check out other guys."
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not gonna talk to some other guy."
Tom Haverford,"Look, I just wanted to show him what it felt like to have your exwife date someone you know."
Tom Haverford,"No, we're donezo."
Tom Haverford,Donezo.
Tom Haverford,You want to come over to my house and play video games?
Tom Haverford,"Hanging out, getting food together, donezo."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome back into the world of walking, Andy."
Tom Haverford,It means you and I are donezo.
Tom Haverford,"If you don't make it, you're on my Donezo list."
Tom Haverford,Meeting in one hour.
Tom Haverford,"Just get other people to drink it, okay?"
Tom Haverford,Then don't drink it.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,"I mix a bunch of alcohol together, I add some sugar and coffee and some other junk, and it kind of tastes like Kahlua."
Tom Haverford,Don't want none of that animal dander interacting with this cashmere.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're welcome, Ann."
Tom Haverford,"I'm launching my new high end, Kahlua style liqueur, Snake Juice."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Tom, you want to come play PuttPutt with me?"
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,Because I'm just a little puppy.
Tom Haverford,Got you a little gift in New York.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna find April.
Tom Haverford,What's that?
Tom Haverford,I got her a really nice Burberry necktie.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks for the advice, man."
Tom Haverford,"And if she murders me, tell JeanRalphio to clear my browser history."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'll talk to her before the party."
Tom Haverford,I once saw her punch a police horse in the face.
Tom Haverford,She scares the crap out of me.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, it's not that."
Tom Haverford,Do we need to sit like this?
Tom Haverford,Whatever happened after that is not my fault.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, there."
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,"No, it's too gross."
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Tom Haverford,You're right.
Tom Haverford,"We know we want to be together forever, so why wait?"
Tom Haverford,"Off the top of my head, I guess, my ideal proposal might be a multiplatform media experience."
Tom Haverford,"An action movie, with explosive graphics, fast cars and a hero with one mission, to propose to his lady."
Tom Haverford,A hero named Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Why can't everyone share our commitment to the basic concept of outrageous pageantry?
Tom Haverford,Take this resume and shove it into your human resources slot.
Tom Haverford,"No! I'm sick of being treated like I'm not willing to relocate to Eagleton, because I am! So here's what you could do, lady."
Tom Haverford,"Why don't you take your fancy dog, get in your Escalade, and if you have any job openings, maybe you should let me know about 'em."
Tom Haverford,"See that Rolex Submariner on your wrist, bro."
Tom Haverford,That's 'cause of Leslie.
Tom Haverford,She gets back tomorrow.
Tom Haverford,She's in Philadelphia visiting friends.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, Lucy's not in town."
Tom Haverford,I think I'm probably gonna wait.
Tom Haverford,But I can't.
Tom Haverford,I wish I could have one.
Tom Haverford,I like your mustache.
Tom Haverford,I'm just a puppy.
Tom Haverford,I ain't done nothing wrong.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, you're right, I should probably keep 'em."
Tom Haverford,"They're a size six and a half, too small for you anyway."
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,Do you understand?
Tom Haverford,"I said, if you don't shape up, I'll fire you."
Tom Haverford,Or else I'll fire you.
Tom Haverford,You need to start putting in more of an effort and start respecting my authority around here!
Tom Haverford,We're doing this now.
Tom Haverford,LesLegally Blonde.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Did you order the champagne for the client party tonight?
Tom Haverford,MonaLisa!
Tom Haverford,We appreciate your business.
Tom Haverford,"It's 15 for the day, 40 for the week. Thank you."
Tom Haverford,Amazing.
Tom Haverford,Lot of great meetings.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, Lucy and I had the best time."
Tom Haverford,"It's for real, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,We even went to a jewelry store and looked at rings.
Tom Haverford,Better than well.
Tom Haverford,The man's really found his calling.
Tom Haverford,I'm just a little puppy.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, we need to discuss your work habits."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"I'm proud of me, too."
Tom Haverford,"Nice crooning, buddy."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, Jessica is a gold digger."
Tom Haverford,And who's going to comfort Jessica and her millions of dollars?
Tom Haverford,That floppy old bag of money is gonna be dead in like a month.
Tom Haverford,I'm one of the Indian people.
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,"Come here, you!"
Tom Haverford,"Sir, it is an honor to meet you."
Tom Haverford,And this must be the luckiest man in Indiana.
Tom Haverford,'Cause you look barely legal.
Tom Haverford,Are you aging in reverse?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, boo!"
Tom Haverford,Jessica Wicks.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"What's going on, cupcake?"
Tom Haverford,Excited about the party tonight.
Tom Haverford,Jerry already told me.
Tom Haverford,Can't wait to see how tiny your costume is.
Tom Haverford,What time does it start?
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Tom Haverford,What about a cologne that can kill spiders?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, burn it."
Tom Haverford,Let's give it a shot.
Tom Haverford,"But, I do like the idea me doing something."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm not crazy about the part where you do something."
Tom Haverford,It's my fault for believing in you.
Tom Haverford,"I No, no."
Tom Haverford,Do you even want to kill at this wedding?
Tom Haverford,You're murdering my beautiful words!
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, horrible delivery."
Tom Haverford,But I'm a gold digger digger.
Tom Haverford,"So, how did you and Mr. Newport meet?"
Tom Haverford,Just photoshop me in later.
Tom Haverford,I'm going to send you a glamor shot.
Tom Haverford,What? I take it all back.
Tom Haverford,That's a lot of diamonds.
Tom Haverford,"Gimme, gimme, gimme."
Tom Haverford,You're not gonna return them?
Tom Haverford,"and pound cake, am I right?"
Tom Haverford,"I promise you hon, Jerry only has eyes for you."
Tom Haverford,"I'm not gay, neither is Jerry, and I didn't pose for him."
Tom Haverford,"Ha! I'm usually a Tom, but sometimes, I'm a Donna."
Tom Haverford,What? No.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no! Take it again."
Tom Haverford,I've got to go recalibrate the quiz.
Tom Haverford,"Gayle, sweetheart, you have nothing to worry about, okay."
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Who cares?
Tom Haverford,That I look like Tay Diggs.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, you do the wedding."
Tom Haverford,I've got to throw it away.
Tom Haverford,My heavens!
Tom Haverford,"Damn it, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"Why, this is amazing, it looks like me and I look awesome."
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not."
Tom Haverford,It weighs a billion tons.
Tom Haverford,"If that's a job offer, I accept."
Tom Haverford,I'd hate to miss the view.
Tom Haverford,After you.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, it looks amazing."
Tom Haverford,I've never heard it before and I think it's a great saying.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,The lighting is all wrong.
Tom Haverford,It's terrible!
Tom Haverford,You've changed.
Tom Haverford,So let the record reflect that.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I am not a fat baby."
Tom Haverford,"T Pain, baby!"
Tom Haverford,That's the worst idea I've ever heard.
Tom Haverford,"She poppin', she rollin', she rollin' She climbin' that pole and I'm in love with a stripper"
Tom Haverford,This is not a stripper.
Tom Haverford,"I'm talking, like, six guaranteed applause breaks."
Tom Haverford,There's a dance breakdown.
Tom Haverford,I was gonna beatbox.
Tom Haverford,I had all these great bits written for the wedding too.
Tom Haverford,"It's my wife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,I want it now!
Tom Haverford,But this is America.
Tom Haverford,Uhh!
Tom Haverford,"""Your Minister Certification will be emailed to you in 24 hours."""
Tom Haverford,You remember her?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, what the hell!"
Tom Haverford,"She's a surgeon at County General, and she's super hot."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, what happened here?"
Tom Haverford,Did you tell everyone they're gonna have to get a bone marrow transplant tomorrow?
Tom Haverford,They look miserable.
Tom Haverford,This party's a disaster.
Tom Haverford,Don't worry about it.
Tom Haverford,We can fix this.
Tom Haverford,Give us a second.
Tom Haverford,"Door, door!"
Tom Haverford,Door!
Tom Haverford,Door!
Tom Haverford,"He's kind of right, Chris."
Tom Haverford,You were freaking out because you were thinking about Andy and his family and how you don't have one.
Tom Haverford,"Every time something tiny goes wrong, you spiral like crazy."
Tom Haverford,Wait!
Tom Haverford,"What if you do the ceremony, but you don't have any stupid ideas of your own, and you just say the stuff that I came up with?"
Tom Haverford,"Get your Raggedy ass over here, girl."
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Tom Haverford,"However, this thing is disgusting and wrong."
Tom Haverford,Quick question about Ann does anyone know if she has any indian in her?
Tom Haverford,"If I had my laptop right now, I would show you a well-hidden folder with gigabytes of proof."
Tom Haverford,"In fact, you could say I'm definitely for it."
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,I'm just curious if Ann has a little indian in her.
Tom Haverford,"Council, I am not opposed to pornography."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, what'd the doc say? Everything okay?"
Tom Haverford,Would she like some?
Tom Haverford,Nothing?
Tom Haverford,"Chris, that means everything's okay."
Tom Haverford,Why weren't you at practice this morning?
Tom Haverford,"Damn it, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,You're into that?
Tom Haverford,"I'm a small, slender man, similar to actor Taye Diggs."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Maybe you've seen me down at the Snakehole Lounge.
Tom Haverford,I totally agree with you that people should be allowed to have sex in public places.
Tom Haverford,I just wanted to say I thought you made some excellent points up there.
Tom Haverford,"Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, you okay?"
Tom Haverford,Still thinking about your ex?
Tom Haverford,"Cool, so I found a DJ for the dance, and his name is DJ Bluntz."
Tom Haverford,"Who's gonna do it, then?"
Tom Haverford,Close it!
Tom Haverford,"All right, I'll see you later, Chris."
Tom Haverford,Ann!
Tom Haverford,"What's up, gorgeous!"
Tom Haverford,We open with Will Smith's monologue from the modern cinematic classic Hitch.
Tom Haverford,Now shut up and start memorizing.
Tom Haverford,I'm a part owner there.
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you have betrayed me and everything we stand for."
Tom Haverford,How's everything? You properly treating yo' self out there in Seattle?
Tom Haverford,They all failed.
Tom Haverford,But the story of America isn't about second or third chances.
Tom Haverford,"It's about fourth, fifth, sixth, twentieth, fiftieth chances."
Tom Haverford,That's how long it took me to get where I am today.
Tom Haverford,"Best selling author of Failure, An American Success Story."
Tom Haverford,"As you know if you've read the book, I've outlined seven different types of successful people."
Tom Haverford,You can be an Andy.
Tom Haverford,An April.
Tom Haverford,A Ben.
Tom Haverford,"On behalf of Tommy's tummy foundation, I'm happy to accept this generous donation."
Tom Haverford,"Crab, caviar?"
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,A Leslie.
Tom Haverford,A Ron.
Tom Haverford,Tommy's tummy foundation.
Tom Haverford,Actually have my own charity to attend to.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna head out.
Tom Haverford,"Well, it sounds like you guys got it covered."
Tom Haverford,A Donna.
Tom Haverford,Or my personal favorite.
Tom Haverford,A Tom.
Tom Haverford,But what do we definitely not want to be?
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,Do not be a Garry.
Tom Haverford,"This is my wife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"Thanks so much for coming, guys."
Tom Haverford,She's my age.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I couldn't have done it without you."
Tom Haverford,I opened a clothing rental store.
Tom Haverford,I once started an entertainment company. It failed in four months.
Tom Haverford,What do I do now?
Tom Haverford,"This time, I was smart and careful, and I still went broke."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, the gentleman by the bar there sent you over this glass of wine, and his business card."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, as you all know, Tom's Bistro has been presented with a huge expansion opportunity, and I don't want to make a decision until I hear from my senior advisory board."
Tom Haverford,"So, is this a good idea?"
Tom Haverford,Accounting Nerd.
Tom Haverford,"No can do, Accounting Nerd."
Tom Haverford,We all knew you before you were a big shot.
Tom Haverford,Let's keep the whining to a minimum.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,The worst.
Tom Haverford,Ron?
Tom Haverford,Regal Meagle?
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I'm doing it.
Tom Haverford,It never gets old.
Tom Haverford,"Over the next five years, there's going to be 20 Tom's Bistros across America."
Tom Haverford,Tommy's about to blow up.
Tom Haverford,"And blow up he did, but not in a good way."
Tom Haverford,He lost everything.
Tom Haverford,"Today, Tom Haverford is broke, destitute."
Tom Haverford,"And worst of all, swaggerless."
Tom Haverford,I can't tear myself away.
Tom Haverford,It's a whole documentary about my failures.
Tom Haverford,I had to.
Tom Haverford,I have to remember every tiny awful aspect of this.
Tom Haverford,"I lost everything, Lucy."
Tom Haverford,"The franchises, most of my money-- I had to sell my pocket square collection!"
Tom Haverford,What are people's eyes going to be drawn to?
Tom Haverford,"That's the problem, though."
Tom Haverford,"I've gone bust in the past, but it was because I did something reckless."
Tom Haverford,"Look out, world."
Tom Haverford,I can't believe you went non-profit.
Tom Haverford,I'm serious.
Tom Haverford,"Here, I inscribed you a copy."
Tom Haverford,"He's six, but he has Benjamin Button Disease."
Tom Haverford,Get set.
Tom Haverford,I do!
Tom Haverford,Get at me!
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,"But it's the only place that I can get my Bumble and Bumble hair care products, so I'm there every eight days."
Tom Haverford,I would never set foot over there.
Tom Haverford,People in Eagleton are straight up mean to us.
Tom Haverford,Don't give up.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, lil sparkle."
Tom Haverford,You got to show Eagleton I.D. to get in.
Tom Haverford,There's even a security guard.
Tom Haverford,Last night Eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting Pawnee hobos off their precious land.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, do you want to say some stuff about Ben now?"
Tom Haverford,"I assume, and hope, you prepared your own vows? Ben, you want to say some stuff about Leslie?"
Tom Haverford,"So I say, let's keep it short and sweet."
Tom Haverford,And they're so impatient to begin their lives together they've moved their wedding date up three months.
Tom Haverford,It's been a long and winding road for these two lovebirds.
Tom Haverford,We are gathered here tonight to join Leslie Knope and Benjamin Wyatt in marriage.
Tom Haverford,They put up a fence.
Tom Haverford,What do I do?
Tom Haverford,"There's, like, 20 minutes of Hitch quotes before I even say Leslie's name."
Tom Haverford,"Mmhmm Jerry, everything I wrote is wrong."
Tom Haverford,Do you think it's gonna leave a scar?
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ron, about everything."
Tom Haverford,I'll drink to that.
Tom Haverford,Nice glasses.
Tom Haverford,"Because my first book was such a smash, I had to come up with a new angle for the follow-up."
Tom Haverford,"Then, it hit me, Failure 2.0: Failing to Fail."
Tom Haverford,What does Leslie always say?
Tom Haverford,She used to read him books at the senior center.
Tom Haverford,"Playaz, at your marks."
Tom Haverford,"Run for your wife, son!"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, sorry, that's actually for Kendrick Lamar."
Tom Haverford,Here's yours.
Tom Haverford,This place is insane.
Tom Haverford,Check out the new digs.
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,And I mean every word of it.
Tom Haverford,"So, I heard you went to Indiana State."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,My buddy Todd went there.
Tom Haverford,Maybe you know him.
Tom Haverford,"Actually, I think there's a simpler solution."
Tom Haverford,We just need the help of the most powerful man in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,What year did you graduate?
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,You guys have always supported me.
Tom Haverford,"Todd graduated in 2005, so you probably missed him."
Tom Haverford,Seriously?
Tom Haverford,"Come on, there must be some aspect of this job you care about."
Tom Haverford,We bought a bunch of zima when the factory shut down.
Tom Haverford,Pairs nicely with the Jayzima.
Tom Haverford,"It's just a regular beer, but we put it in a sexyass mug."
Tom Haverford,The Beeryonce Knowles.
Tom Haverford,"For instance, I was incredible at naming drinks at the Snakehole Lounge because I care a great deal about signature beverages."
Tom Haverford,You just need to find a project you're passionate about.
Tom Haverford,"She says, ""you get out of a job what you put into it."""
Tom Haverford,Scott Caan from Hawaii five0!
Tom Haverford,No way!
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,Dead or asleep?
Tom Haverford,Dead or asleep?
Tom Haverford,How was your date with Leslie?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Shia LaBeouf is one hell of a jewelry designer, by the way."
Tom Haverford,I'm 28 years old.
Tom Haverford,We can do whatever we want.
Tom Haverford,No boss.
Tom Haverford,Leslie's not here today.
Tom Haverford,All four of you.
Tom Haverford,Everyone stop what you're doing and come with me.
Tom Haverford,Okay!
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford's in the building.
Tom Haverford,"Same thing you're doing, celebrating Pawnee's finest."
Tom Haverford,"Andy, you're hopeless, just take a shower."
Tom Haverford,"Ben, put on something decent, like a tux."
Tom Haverford,"I had to pull a lot of strings to get this meeting, so please, no one embarrass me."
Tom Haverford,"I believe you know my date, Tammy Swanson."
Tom Haverford,"That's a good one, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Hopped up out the bed Turn my swag on Took a look in the mirror, said, ""What's up?"""
Tom Haverford,"To have it, which he does."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, we will definitely go to the telethon soon."
Tom Haverford,It's a Lexus filled with Rolexes.
Tom Haverford,The man owns a Rolexus.
Tom Haverford,"Dennis Feinstein belongs to a new generation of wealth rappers, tech geniuses, X games medallists, and of course, ""scent artists."""
Tom Haverford,"I need you to make that out, To Wendy. Tom is an amazing guy. You never should have left him. You made a huge mistake in your life, and you're probably going to die alone. Love, Detlef."""
Tom Haverford,Very good!
Tom Haverford,Name the scent.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, pop quiz."
Tom Haverford,"I'm getting that, right now."
Tom Haverford,"Do you ever talk to someone and you're just like, ""Oh. We're going to be best friends""?"
Tom Haverford,Win-win.
Tom Haverford,"Brooks Brothers Boys is like, the cuts are slimmer and it's cheaper."
Tom Haverford,"You'd be talking to him, and then, he would just turn into fire."
Tom Haverford,After this song!
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Seriously.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Andy, which rock star would your lady get with?"
Tom Haverford,Impressive!
Tom Haverford,"Come on, big girl."
Tom Haverford,Let's knock these little pins down.
Tom Haverford,What'd your boo say?
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,That right there Tommy's strike.
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Tom Haverford,"Fellas, which rock star would your lady bang if she could bang one rock star?"
Tom Haverford,First question.
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's get to it."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, everybody!"
Tom Haverford,"I'm your host, Tom Haverford, and with me as always is my CGI puppy cohost, Bobby the Boo!"
Tom Haverford,Welcome to Know Ya Boo.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, everybody!"
Tom Haverford,"It's time to know your I don't have the instrumental backing track yet, but it's gonna say ""boo"" right there."
Tom Haverford,That's a dope show.
Tom Haverford,Here's the sitch.
Tom Haverford,"I developed a dope new game show where I ask couples scandalous questions, and they have to guess what the other one answered."
Tom Haverford,I call this Know Ya Boo.
Tom Haverford,"Shut up, Jerry!"
Tom Haverford,"It's not The Newlywed Game, okay?"
Tom Haverford,It is totally The Newlywed Game.
Tom Haverford,"The ultimate celebrity, I think, to hang out with for a night would be Criss Angel."
Tom Haverford,But big deal.
Tom Haverford,"My favorite movie is Love Don't Cost a Thing, with Nick Cannon, which is based on Can't Buy Me Love, which is based on Kramer vs. Kramer or something, which I think was Shakespeare."
Tom Haverford,"Don't know, don't care."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna test it out on you four bingbongs and work out the kinks, then hire actual attractive people, and make a demo."
Tom Haverford,"There's a million networks out there, and they all need programming."
Tom Haverford,"Spike, G4, GSN, Fuse, WOW, Boom, Zip, Kablam, Slurp, Slurp Latin, Slurp HD."
Tom Haverford,Everyone steals.
Tom Haverford,Let's check in with your boo!
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,I got into government for the connections.
Tom Haverford,I'm a natural moneymaker.
Tom Haverford,Why didn't Chris make you sell?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you own shares, too."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,But I've got to get him to the telethon.
Tom Haverford,Bye!
Tom Haverford,"We're leaving soon, all right?"
Tom Haverford,Don't worry.
Tom Haverford,Let's take it easy.
Tom Haverford,I had no idea professional athletes were so popular.
Tom Haverford,People are loving Detlef Schrempf.
Tom Haverford,The Snakehole is booming!
Tom Haverford,I'm so alone.
Tom Haverford,This was supposed to be a thing that led to the other thing.
Tom Haverford,"If I walk into a room, it's like, okay, he's in there."
Tom Haverford,There's a few minutes left.
Tom Haverford,Don't give up yet.
Tom Haverford,"Fight fire with fire, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"He dates my ex, I date his."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Both?
Tom Haverford,What did you major in?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,This is my boss.
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,It won't happen again.
Tom Haverford,"So, what does a Man Pillow look like?"
Tom Haverford,"I totally get your point, Chris."
Tom Haverford,"I'm like an elephant, okay?"
Tom Haverford,What do we do now?
Tom Haverford,What if it's a huge amount? Are you gonna be okay financially?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it is, and I'm definitely tweeting that to Drake to use in his next rhymes, but still I kinda feel like this is our fault."
Tom Haverford,Is seeing your ex-wife on my arm making you uncomfortable?
Tom Haverford,"Gee, I can't imagine why."
Tom Haverford,Or can I?
Tom Haverford,I like this song.
Tom Haverford,"Do you wanna dance, Tammy?"
Tom Haverford,I think that's enough.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Tom.
Tom Haverford,"- Jamm, I'm gonna sue you."
Tom Haverford,My face! Is my face still there? What happened to my knees?
Tom Haverford,Typical Ron Swanson.
Tom Haverford,Always thinking about yourself.
Tom Haverford,Maybe we like each other.
Tom Haverford,"Ow! You assaulted me, and I'm injured!"
Tom Haverford,"Ow! My wrist! You twisted my arm like a maniac! - Oh, no! -"
Tom Haverford,"We cross-referenced it with telephone records and eyewitness accounts, and, uh-oh, we found 11 lies."
Tom Haverford,We took a look at your affidavit.
Tom Haverford,It's like when Vin did Boiler Room.
Tom Haverford,It hurts.
Tom Haverford,That's what led to him being xXx and doing Furious.
Tom Haverford,You're jealous of my gift.
Tom Haverford,You did this on purpose.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, it's already swollen."
Tom Haverford,"Hiya, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"This sucks, man."
Tom Haverford,Ron crushed my finger.
Tom Haverford,My finger was in there.
Tom Haverford,"Because if you were, you did a great job."
Tom Haverford,Were you trying to get a seven?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Nice.
Tom Haverford,I think it might be broken.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, he meant Mark Cuban."
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,Uh!
Tom Haverford,Don't serve this man.
Tom Haverford,No more food until he fixes the giant disaster he's created.
Tom Haverford,"But I guess they've seen me here, too."
Tom Haverford,"For the last time, it's a Rolexus, and you can't drive it."
Tom Haverford,"So, that's not great."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to City Hall, cupcake!"
Tom Haverford,"It's not Feinstein money, but it'll help."
Tom Haverford,"You did-- I was really impressed by all the stuff the foundation's done for all them poor homies, so you know what? Rent-A-Swag is gonna donate five cents from every dollar we make this month."
Tom Haverford,You should apologize for apologizing to that guy.
Tom Haverford,Screw that.
Tom Haverford,It's like they're rubbing it in my face.
Tom Haverford,All I can think about is Captain Mustache plowing my exwife.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,That's what you took away from this?
Tom Haverford,Now I'm imagining a cape.
Tom Haverford,What do you like about her?
Tom Haverford,What don't you like about her?
Tom Haverford,"Her ideas, her voice, her clothes probably."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Wherever you want.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, what's your problem, man? -"
Tom Haverford,No pressure.
Tom Haverford,Insightful.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"I don't even know what you're talking about, us having not talked about."
Tom Haverford,The possum got loose at Ann's house.
Tom Haverford,You just have to ignore him.

Tom Haverford,I don't want to see them together.
Tom Haverford,"Wow, don't be such a Jerry, Ben."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, it's me."
Tom Haverford,We've got to dominate this party.
Tom Haverford,"Get changed, baby."
Tom Haverford,I knew you'd like it.

Trevor Nelson,We would also be interested in acquiring your thinking PJs.
Trevor Nelson,It is not a joke.
Trevor Nelson,"Tom Haverford, my name is Trevor Nelsson."
Trevor Nelson,It is Diddy.
Trevor Nelson,Not that an accountant would know the difference.
Trevor Nelson,It's not Diddy.
Trevor Nelson,I represent a client who would like to make you an offer.
Trevor Nelson,"We will select the finalists from a set of initial, sealed bids due at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow."
Trevor Nelson,"When he rips someone off, he goes all the way."
Trevor Nelson,I suggest you take it.
Trevor Nelson,It's not Lebron James.
Trevor Nelson,No.
Trevor Nelson,10000 dollars.
Trevor Nelson,"Goodbye, Mr. Haverford."
Trevor Nelson,"My client is not Jason Statham, if that's what you're thinking."
Trevor Nelson,Mm.
Trevor Nelson,We are Oreo.
Trevor Nelson,"You see, you are Hydrox, Mr. Haverford."
Trevor Nelson,I get it.
Trevor Nelson,"No, you deeply misunderstand."
Trevor Nelson,My client is a very determined businessman.
Trevor Nelson,I know.
Trevor Nelson,"Ah, Mr. Haverford, back again, I see."
Trevor Nelson,"Ever since my client opened his store across the street, your sales have plummeted."
Trevor Nelson,It's only a matter of time before you're out of business.
Trevor Nelson,"But my client has had a moment of weakness, something he referred to as ""sympathy""?"
Trevor Nelson,"He's made you a final offer 40,000 dollars for RentaSwag and all of its contents."
Trevor Nelson,The offer is valid for 48 hours.
Trevor Nelson,My client has taken an interest in RentASwag.
Trevor Nelson,That's all I need to get started.
Trevor Nelson,Not what I said.
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Chairman, would you like to say a few words?"
Trevor Nelson,"Uh, would you like to explain why?"
Trevor Nelson,What just happened?
Trevor Nelson,"He's calling it ""Tommy's Closet."""
Trevor Nelson,"But since you're not taking the deal, I should inform you that my client will be moving on to plan B: Opening his own store directly across the street from yours."
Trevor Nelson,No.
Trevor Nelson,"I'll run it past my client, but I think we have a deal."
Trevor Nelson,Thank you all for coming.
Trevor Nelson,"I'm Trevor Nelson, legal counsel to the Newport family."
Trevor Nelson,"The Newport Family Trust intends to sell a 25 square mile parcel of pristine, undeveloped land containing Lake Eagleton and the Southern Indiana Foothills."
Trevor Nelson,"Thanks to the recent economic boom in Pawnee, real estate prices are at an all time high."
Trevor Nelson,"And in the words of Jessica Wicks Newport, heir to the entire Newport fortune, quote, ""It's time to trade those dumb old trees for a buttload of cash."""
Trevor Nelson,Which are?
Trevor Nelson,He needs the name.
Trevor Nelson,The name is actually an important part of the sale.
Trevor Nelson,It's better than Tommy's Closet.
Trevor Nelson,Yes.
Trevor Nelson,My client likes the name.
Trevor Nelson,Good luck.
Trevor Nelson,"Despite the recent financial crisis, Very Good Building Company will finish fiscal year 2022 in excellent financial shape, thanks in large part to the stewardship of your chairman, Ron Swanson."
Trevor Nelson,He'd like to know if you are looking to sell a controlling interest in the store.
Trevor Nelson,What are all these symbols?
Trevor Nelson,"It's a high-end secondhand clothing store where parents can rent clothes for their teens, tweens, and pres, as well as babies, toddlers, grown-ups, and olds."
Trevor Nelson,I'm not at liberty to tell you who my client is.
Trevor Nelson,Good day.
Trevor Nelson,It would violate confidentiality.
Trevor Nelson,This lesson will cost you.
Trevor Nelson,It's not Diddy.
Trevor Nelson,That was confusing.
Trevor Nelson,I don't even need an exact number.
Trevor Nelson,Just ballpark it.
Trevor Nelson,Thank you.
Trevor Nelson,You're right.
Trevor Nelson,God.
Trevor Nelson,Holy [bleep].
Trevor Nelson,Is this a joke?
Trevor Nelson,Only this free lesson is going to cost you.
Trevor Nelson,"It's called capitalism, Mr. Haverford, and you are about to get a free lesson."
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Swanson, an estate of this size means that your children would never have to work a day in their lives."
Trevor Nelson,This is going to take some time.
Trevor Nelson,"Trusts need to be drawn, tax shelters."
Trevor Nelson,So I guess only Domino's is allowed to sell pizza now?
Trevor Nelson,Wait.
Trevor Nelson,"Successful people, Mr. Haverford, use their money to get others to work for them."
Trevor Nelson,Check the accountant crap at the door.
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Swanson, let's begin by filling out this form, listing your assets and liabilities."
Trevor Nelson,"As I've said before, I just don't like puns."
Trevor Nelson,Thank you.
Trevor Nelson,"Yes, I understood, Mr. Wyatt."
Trevor Nelson,Good evening.
Trevor Nelson,Yeah.
Trevor Nelson,"And here is a personal note from my client, Dr. Saperstein."
Trevor Nelson,"And finally, here is a check for the entirety of the purchase of Rent A Swag."
Trevor Nelson,It was zero dollars.
Trevor Nelson,"If you don't give me the information I need, there's nothing I can do."
Trevor Nelson,"I have to say, that's one of the lower ones we've seen."
Trevor Nelson,"I'm gonna say this one last time, Wyatt."
Trevor Nelson,My client isn't at this meeting because he doesn't have to be.
Trevor Nelson,"I'm Attorney Trevor Nelsson with the law firm Fwar, Dips, Winshares, Gritt, Babip, Pecota, Vorp and Eckstein, legal counsel to the Newport family, here to announce that the Newport Family Trust has narrowed this search to two final candidates, the Gryzzl corporation and the National Park Service."
Trish Ianetta,But the high birthing rate of immigrants frightens me.
Trish Ianetta,"No offense to anyone out there, but if it were up to me and my family, I would actually call it ""Ourmerica,"" and not ""Theirmerica."""
Trish Ianetta,"One, two, three!"
Trish Ianetta,So funny.
Trish Ianetta,"Well, uh, I think that America is the land of the free, which is a wonderful thing, and also the brave, where people can live, and no one can ever take that away from you and it never gives up."
Trish Ianetta,You are so funny!
Trish Ianetta,This is your house key?
Trish Ianetta,Thank you.
Trish Ianetta,"Hi, y'all."
Trish Ianetta,I'm Trish.
Trish Ianetta,Are y'all having a good time?
Trish Ianetta,Thank you.
Trish Ianetta,I just want everyone--
Trish Ianetta,"I'm 22 years old, I've been on YouTube."
Trish Ianetta,"I just I love to hang out with my friends, I love to laugh, I love the summertime and going to the beach, and I love wearing bikinis at the beach with everyone there."
Trish Ianetta,You're so funny.
Trish Ianetta,What?
Trodd,Gryzzl's currently trying to buy an enormous parcel of land to build a permanent headquarters in Pawnee.
Trodd,"In your opinion, have you done anything wrong?"
Trodd,"Roscoe, people in this town are very angry about Gryzzl's data mining program."
Trodd,How will you win back our trust?
Tynnyfer,"Ew, no."
Tynnyfer,You are so amazing right now.
Tynnyfer,I'm having so much fun right now.
Tynnyfer,I've had so much rejuvenation that I don't think a baby could get out of there if it tried.
Tynnyfer,You're like skinny Mother Theresa.
Tynnyfer,Yeah.
Tynnyfer,"This is, like, the best day ever."
Tynnyfer,What?
Tynnyfer,"Right now, I totally think that you're right, and I had been thinking about going someplace warm while my husband is in jail."
Tynnyfer,It was all so delicious.
Tynnyfer,Can I just say something?
Tynnyfer,Yes!
Tynnyfer,"Okay, can I say something?"
Tynnyfer,I've never heard of them before.
Tynnyfer,"Oh, wait, hang on."
Tynnyfer,"I saw my spinning instructor wearing it, and I was like, ""Shut up."""
Tynnyfer,"No, it's Tynnyfer with two y's."
Tynnyfer,Where do I get that?
Tynnyfer,You have to text me.
Tynnyfer,"Like, that's a must, must, must."
Tynnyfer,"Seriously, you need to get me in there."
Tynnyfer,Are they better?
Tynnyfer,It's Xanax o'clock.
Tynnyfer,Who are Gregory and Wynona?
Tynnyfer,I go to Yonis.
Tynnyfer,"I used to be Jennifer, but then I decided to rebrand myself."
Typhoon,Everyone was on their stupid bikes.
Typhoon,"Maybe if you had bothered to come to my Great Gatsby Brunch, you'd know."
Typhoon,"Donna, quit punishing me! I miss you."
Typhoon,"I'm writing an electronic opera about Brittany Murphy, and I do the chandelier design for my friend's drag puppet show."
Typhoon,Do you have any regrets?
Typhoon,Typhoon is an artist and the human head is--
Typhoon,Not a single one.
Typhoon,"Hi, I'm Typhoon."
Typhoon,"I was like, ""Ew""."
Typhoon,"Donna, this is crazy."
Typhoon,Not one.
Typhoon,"Oh, just relax, you nervous nelly."
Typhoon,"Except lately, all the good warehouse raves are filled with Euro trash."
Typhoon,Fine.
Typhoon,Yes.
Typhoon,"Oh, my God, I had the worst time in Berlin last May."
Typhoon,All I really want to do is dance.
Typhoon,Ugh.
Ulani,Whatever.
Ulani,Sorry.
Ulani,I think it's mean that you didn't do a square for me.
Ulani,"""Cheerful."""
Ulani,Where's my square?
Ulani,I feel weird.
Ulani,Let's just drive back.
Ulani,"Oh, I didn't know we could cut that."
Ulani,They didn't know I was coming?
Ulani,"Yes, Julia, I am, but I can't because I'm pregnant."
Ulani,"What the hell, Steve?"
Ulani,"I'm good, thanks."
Ulee Danssen,I'm one of the honorees.
Ulee Danssen,"Silkeborg is wonderful, and I am very supported and loved."
Ulee Danssen,You must be Leslie Knope.
Ulee Danssen,What about your town?
Ulee Danssen,"I don't, no."
Ulee Danssen,You're always welcome in Silkeborg!
Ulee Danssen,"It was beautiful, and the reindeer was delicious."
Ulee Danssen,"Oh, hi."
Ulee Danssen,What?
Ulee Danssen,I'm Ulee Danssen.
Ulee Danssen,"Oh, thanks!"
Ulee Danssen,They just love me.
Ulee Danssen,"We have a lot of it, and after tonight's event, they're going to consume me with crackers."
Ulee Danssen,It is made out of goat cheese.
Ulee Danssen,Yes.
Ulee Danssen,And look what they've done for me.
Ulee Danssen,"Good cheese eye, Leslie."
Ulee Danssen,"It's not one of the most perfect places in the world, but I love it, and it loves me."
Ulee Danssen,"You know, we all have that in Denmark."
Ulee Danssen,I'm from Silkeborg.
Ulee Danssen,"Olga, let's start a statue of Leslie."
Ulee Danssen,You know.
Ulee Danssen,"Once, on my birthday, the town trained a reindeer to do a dance for me."
Vaughn Swanson,Ron.
Vaughn Swanson,Best of luck.
Waiter,You ready to order?
Waiter,"For legal reasons, we're not allowed to make puns about the temperature of the meats anymore."
Waiter,"Welcome to Jurassic Fork, where the only thing that'll be extinct is your appetite."
Waiter,Medium rare?
Waiter,Hi.
Waiter,Sir.
Waiter,Please.
Waiter,"Please, folks."
Waiter,"Excuse me, folks."
Waiter,How do you want that cooked?
Waiter,Ma'am.
Waiter,"No cigars inside, sir."
Walter Gunderson,"Fortunately, the citizens of Pawnee didn't pay attention either."
Walter Gunderson,But I wasn't really doing very much.
Walter Gunderson,I wasn't paying attention most of the time.
Walter Gunderson,"So, uh, if there's credit to take, I will humbly take it."
Walter Gunderson,"And if there is blame, it's your fault."
Walter Gunderson,Thank you.
Walter Gunderson,And goodbye forever.
Walter Gunderson,My time in office has come to an end.
Walter Gunderson,A lot has been done.
Walter Gunderson,"Hello, Pawnee."
Wendell Adams,"Andy, no."
Wendell Adams,I've advised my client not to speak with you.
Wendell Adams,I'm Andrew's attorney.
Wendell Adams,He's suing the City of Pawnee.
Wendell Adams,"Andy, stop."
Wendy,My husband's the one that's being carried by his boss.
Wendy,"No, that's his... That's his boss."
Wendy,"Hi, you ready to go?"
Wendy,No.
Wendy,"For, you know, not telling anyone."
Wendy,"Yeah, that's... That's my husband."
Wendy,You're very brave.
Wendy,Poor Tommy.
Wendy,You're suing me for alimony?
Wendy,I'll see you around.
Wendy,Totally.
Wendy,All right.
Wendy,Thank you so much.
Wendy,We had so much fun.
Wendy,Hey.
Wendy,Are you ready?
Wendy,And I just want to say thank you for not telling anyone.
Wendy,Are we late?
Wendy,"Tom, what are you doing?"
Wendy,Tom told me that you know about our green card marriage.
Wendy,I was just thanking Ron.
Wendy,Uh... Technically.
Wendy,Come on in.
Wendy,This is insane.
Wendy,He has a very frail colon.
Wendy,"Hey, I don't suppose you'd want to move to Canada?"
Wendy,"Ron, are you ready?"
Wendy,I just feel like the right thing to do is to move back home.
Wendy,Hi.
Wendy,"Hey, Tommy."
Wendy,Bye.
Wendy,We have a good time together.
Wendy,And we'll invite you to the divorce party.
Wendy,Mmm-hmm.
Wendy,"You know, you won't have to keep it a secret much longer, because in a few months we can split up without raising any eyebrows."
Wendy,Oh!
Wendy,"They're getting really old, and I'm an only child."
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy,"So your plan was to sue me, and then to use that to blackmail me into falling in love with you."
Wendy,"God, this is so weird."
Wendy,"Oh, boy."
Wendy,What?
Wendy,Oh! Oh.
Wendy,Excuse me?
Wendy,Sorry to interrupt.
Wendy,Ron.
Wendy,I'm sorry.
Wendy,"Yeah, hi."
Wendy,"Well, hey, you guys must be starving."
Wendy,I'm sorry.
Wendy,Right?
Wendy,I just don't feel that way about you.
Wendy,"It's, like, end of an era, huh? It's kind of sad."
Wendy,I do!
Wendy,You wanted to talk?
Wendy,Mmm.
Wendy,"Well, I will see you around, I guess."
Wendy,"Okay, all right."
Wendy,"Look, Tommy, I just want you to know I'm so grateful for everything you did for me, but I only see us as friends."
Wendy,I got your message.
Wendy,How did Leslie meet her boyfriend?
Wendy,"Well, hey."
Wendy,Oh!
Wendy,Let me just stop you right there.
Wendy,Yeah.
Wendy,Oh.
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy,Hi.
Wendy,Hey.
Wendy,"Uh, no, thanks."
Wendy,You want me to order you pizza or something?
Wendy,Don't hold it against me.
Wendy,"Very good, thank you."

Wendy,Thank you so much for inviting us.
Wendy,"Yeah, well, Jay-Z doesn't have to perform surgery in an hour."
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy,Okay.
William Barnes,We know it was you.
William Barnes,"Now, we knew we'd take a hit, but we figured as long as we're at 15% or above, we're still in the fight."
William Barnes,"Actually, no, sorry."
William Barnes,But listen.
William Barnes,We weren't here to see you.
William Barnes,"Leslie, hi."
William Barnes,"When you run, even in a local election, your life becomes an open book."
William Barnes,"Well, that's a long way off."
William Barnes,You're gonna announce your candidacy on Friday.
William Barnes,"Uh, well, before the scandal, you were at 26%."
William Barnes,"No, this Friday."
William Barnes,"Hey, Leslie, you ready?"
William Barnes,"The first step is for us to figure out what we're up against, and we've already got polls out in the field, and we should have results back in a couple of days."
William Barnes,"See, you staked your reputation on this."
William Barnes,Are you Leslie Knope?
William Barnes,We are part of a group that tries to identify potential candidates for political office here in town.
William Barnes,And we think that you might fit the bill.
William Barnes,Excuse me.
William Barnes,We are part of a group that tries to identify potential candidates for political office here in town.
William Barnes,All we need to know right now is are you theoretically interested in running for office?
William Barnes,Are you theoretically interested in running for office?
William Barnes,Great.
William Barnes,This won't do it.
William Barnes,"Well, no."
William Barnes,"You know, a sex scandal with your boss."
William Barnes,"Well, this just says ""Wamapoke County."""
William Barnes,Mmhmm.
William Barnes,Excuse me.
William Barnes,Is that okay?
William Barnes,See you next week?
William Barnes,You're polling at 1%.
William Barnes,"Just stay out of the spotlight until we can figure out just how this, uh, incident has affected the voters."
William Barnes,It's a small town.
William Barnes,You did an amazing job.
William Barnes,"Before we go any further, I need you to tell me is there a scandal out there?"
William Barnes,We've been meeting with other potential candidates for city council.
William Barnes,I think we should start talking strategy.
William Barnes,Are you Leslie Knope?
William Barnes,It's very hard to come back from this kind of thing.
William Barnes,My name is William Barnes.
William Barnes,"So you need to go down to the county records office in Eagleton and get the original, long form certificate."
William Barnes,We can't run your campaign anymore.
William Barnes,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
William Barnes,"And you were also responsible for the Harvest Festival, correct?"
William Barnes,You're in the shot.
William Barnes,"You were a great candidate, butit's over."
William Barnes,Do you have a minute to talk?
William Barnes,"Well, we'll be in touch."
William Barnes,What?
William Barnes,All right.
William Barnes,You don't have to be modest.
William Barnes,"I'm sorry, could you Just step over here?"
William Barnes,"So before we go any further, I need you to tell me, is there a scandal out there? Is there anything at all you need to tell us about your life?"
William Barnes,"Well, uh, good luck, Leslie."
William Barnes,There's nowhere to hide.
William Barnes,"Now, we have three months until you announce your campaign."
William Barnes,Hey.
William Barnes,"Uh, well, it probably won't come up in a local City Council election."
William Barnes,Hi.
William Barnes,"You're gonna get great feedback on this, and we think we can capitalize."
William Barnes,"But your thoroughness, as always, is impressive."
William Barnes,"So if you so much as stiff a waiter on his tip or use a government stamp for personal mail, it will come out."
William Barnes,You ready?
William Barnes,Is there anything at all you need to tell us about your life?
William Barnes,Let's say 10 or 15 to be safe.
William Barnes,"Well, I see you've taken our advice about relaxing."
William Barnes,Honestly.
Wreston St. James,I remember when Pawnee had that massive sewage overflow in Circle Park whatever happened with that?
Wreston St. James,Excuse me.
Wreston St. James,I've never met two people more passionate about their hometown.
Wreston St. James,"I call it the Pawnee Commons, a celebration of Pawnee's history and people."
Wreston St. James,I'd expect no less.
Wreston St. James,"Oh, our balloon artisan is out of balloons."
Wreston St. James,"Well, I heard your plea on the radio, and you were so passionate about the project."
Wreston St. James,It doesn't matter if it's a giant park like this or a little tiny pocket park.
Wreston St. James,It's about the people.
Wreston St. James,"Actually, like most people from the area, I have ancestors on both sides."
Wreston St. James,We're here to serve them.
Wreston St. James,"As you can see, we like to keep things quite immaculate."
Wreston St. James,Hi!
Wreston St. James,Thank you.
Wreston St. James,Leslie.
Wreston St. James,Ben!
Wreston St. James,"You know what, as a gesture of good will, I'd like to waive my fee."
Wreston St. James,I'll design the park pro bono.
Wreston St. James,Thank you so much for coming.
Wreston St. James,"God, I'm so sorry I'm late."
Wreston St. James,I've been working up a little model of the design.
Wreston St. James,"Well, what do you think of our newest park?"
Wreston St. James,"Why don't I bring it over, and we can all go through it together."
Wreston St. James,Thank you.
Wreston St. James,"Its official name is ""Five Mile Grounds"", but we like to call it ""Wide smiles abound."""
Wreston St. James,"Come on, I'll take you guys on a little tour."
Wreston St. James,What?
Wreston St. James,We owe them a debt of gratitude.
Wreston St. James,I had nothing to do with that stupid prank.
Wreston St. James,"In fact, that's why I'm late."
Wreston St. James,That's why I think this rivalry is just a little silly and selfdefeating.
Wreston St. James,"I was firing the two people who were responsible, and I was escorting them out of the building."
Wreston St. James,"Full disclosure, Certain people in the firm wanted to promote them, but I insisted they be fired."
Wreston St. James,I would really love to.
Wreston St. James,Wreston St. James.
Wreston St. James,But what about Leslie? I just doubt that she can ever get over the bad blood between our towns.
Wreston St. James,"Look Ms. Knope, I'm really trying here, but I just don't know if our working together is such a great idea."
Wreston St. James,Why do you know so much about Pawnee?
Wreston St. James,I'm just glad you like it.
