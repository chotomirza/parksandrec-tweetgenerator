Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"My name is Leslie Knope, and I work for the Parks and Recreation Department."
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a few questions?
Leslie Knope,"Would you say that you are, ""Enjoying yourself and having fun, having a moderate amount of fun and somewhat enjoying yourself, or having no fun and no enjoyment?"""
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna put a lot of fun.
Leslie Knope,"Sir, this is a children's slide."
Leslie Knope,You're not allowed to sleep in here.
Leslie Knope,"You know, when I first tell people that I work in the government, they say, ""Oh."""
Leslie Knope,"""The government."""
Leslie Knope,"""The government stinks."""
Leslie Knope,"""The lines are too long at the DMV."""
Leslie Knope,But now things have changed.
Leslie Knope,People need our help.
Leslie Knope,And it feels good to be needed.
Leslie Knope,Could you put your arms to your side?
Leslie Knope,And that might help you slide down a little easier.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to come this way?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we're gonna need you to get out."
Leslie Knope,Get out of the slide.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Here we go!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wake up."
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Out of the slide.
Leslie Knope,"You know, government isn't just a boys' club anymore."
Leslie Knope,Women are everywhere.
Leslie Knope,It's a great time to be a woman in politics.
Leslie Knope,"Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi."
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,"You know, I like to tell people, you know, ""Get on board and buckle up, because my ride's gonna be a big one."""
Leslie Knope,"And if you get motion sickness, you know, put your head between your knees 'cause Leslie Knope's stopping for no one."
Leslie Knope,And that is tonight.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,This is a great thing for you guys to see.
Leslie Knope,This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings.
Leslie Knope,"When I go through these doors, I need to be on."
Leslie Knope,Like the White House Press Secretary.
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,It's locked.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,What an amazing turnout.
Leslie Knope,My name is Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I am the deputy director of the Parks and Recreation Department, and tonight we're gonna be taking some of your questions as--"
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting in here.
Leslie Knope,"So, take two."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, and with me is department member Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,"We are here to answer any and all of your questions, so fire away."
Leslie Knope,I don't like obscenities just as much as you don't like them.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"These people are members of a community that care about where they live, so what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, Barry."
Leslie Knope,Always great to have you here.
Leslie Knope,Anyone else who would like to contribute?
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Tell us about that.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Twelve months, yes."
Leslie Knope,Go on.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'll do something about it.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we-- I will help you."
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.
Leslie Knope,"I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of."
Leslie Knope,"Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats."
Leslie Knope,"But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam."
Leslie Knope,Morning.
Leslie Knope,You were talking to the mayor?
Leslie Knope,Tom and I work really well together.
Leslie Knope,We're both outsiders.
Leslie Knope,"I'm a woman, he's a... I think he's a Libyan."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, brainstorm."
Leslie Knope,How do we make this park happen?
Leslie Knope,"No, parks are not a priority."
Leslie Knope,I need more firepower.
Leslie Knope,I need bigger guns.
Leslie Knope,You know what I need to do?
Leslie Knope,Form a committee.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen."
Leslie Knope,Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.
Leslie Knope,That's really good.
Leslie Knope,Write that down.
Leslie Knope,"From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down."
Leslie Knope,He's collecting them for my memoirs.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, read it back to me."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Sounded better when I said it.
Leslie Knope,"It's still good, though."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,What about bringing Mark on board?
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz.
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that."
Leslie Knope,He's kind of like a fixer.
Leslie Knope,He fixes things.
Leslie Knope,"He's a smart, capable guy."
Leslie Knope,He just-- He knows where the bodies are buried.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Brendanawicz?"
Leslie Knope,You crazy old Polish person.
Leslie Knope,"City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you... Then you can't take it."
Leslie Knope,You gotta leave the locker room.
Leslie Knope,Let's get down to brass tacks.
Leslie Knope,I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for clearing your schedule."
Leslie Knope,"You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?"
Leslie Knope,What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.
Leslie Knope,I can do this.
Leslie Knope,I just need a little help.
Leslie Knope,"Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?"
Leslie Knope,Mark and I-- It's complicated.
Leslie Knope,"When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen."
Leslie Knope,We slept together.
Leslie Knope,It's Ms. Perkins' house.
Leslie Knope,I'm here.
Leslie Knope,Safety.
Leslie Knope,You remember Tom from last night.
Leslie Knope,"And this is our college intern, April."
Leslie Knope,She's going to be documenting our fact finding mission.
Leslie Knope,This must be our hero.
Leslie Knope,The man heard 'round the world.
Leslie Knope,"How you doing, son?"
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,How did we let this happen?
Leslie Knope,"Dream with me for a second, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park?
Leslie Knope,"Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field."
Leslie Knope,We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.
Leslie Knope,We could do some of those things.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna take a little extra work.
Leslie Knope,But why not try?
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,I'm going in.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,I have a hard hat on.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"April, document this."
Leslie Knope,"The key to any factfinding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?"
Leslie Knope,It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Mmmmmm.
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.
Leslie Knope,After my head hit that rod.
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle."
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, my clavicle's broken."
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Are pancakes being made?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I've been a loyal foot soldier.
Leslie Knope,Give me my shot.
Leslie Knope,Let me have Lot 48.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you."
Leslie Knope,When you've been down in the pit-- Have you been in the pit?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have."
Leslie Knope,When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact finding mission.
Leslie Knope,"And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means."
Leslie Knope,"And let me tell you something, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What it means is I want this subcommittee.
Leslie Knope,I like the sound of that definitely.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, I presume."
Leslie Knope,Lot 46 thoughts? Yes? No? Me? Park?
Leslie Knope,Giving the park to me?
Leslie Knope,"All right, you guys."
Leslie Knope,"All right, all right."
Leslie Knope,I'll ask him.
Leslie Knope,Everybody wants to know what your decision is.
Leslie Knope,Someone on the phone about the park.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't think I even want it."
Leslie Knope,Oh man.
Leslie Knope,My clavicle's still really hurting me.
Leslie Knope,"So this was built in 1935, it's called Pioneer Hall. And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,This is our crown jewel.
Leslie Knope,It's one of our best murals.
Leslie Knope,It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you want to see? The DMV? Animal control? Or we could--"
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,That's so exciting! This is huge.
Leslie Knope,"I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,I'm a rocket ship.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it great?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited.
Leslie Knope,"It's exciting, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Should I call a press conference now, or--"
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,America is awesome.
Leslie Knope,It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.
Leslie Knope,You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.
Leslie Knope,You gotta be ready for it.
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Soul sista, soul sista Gonna get your phone, sista"
Leslie Knope,Sweet Lady Marmalard
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I think it's a real shame when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal.
Leslie Knope,"Personally, all I care about is Councilman Dexhart's policies."
Leslie Knope,Not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex.
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, I heard he was."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,What are you guys doing?
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, will be our first official... First date."
Leslie Knope,Copy.
Leslie Knope,Over and out.
Leslie Knope,Dave and I are going on our first date tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,I'm not nervous.
Leslie Knope,Why should I be nervous?
Leslie Knope,We're just two people going on a first date.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to be nervous about.
Leslie Knope,That was my phone.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, listen, I'm really nervous about this date tomorrow night."
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a first date outfit I can borrow?"
Leslie Knope,"Like, I don't know, a pair of cargo pants?"
Leslie Knope,"What about, like, a sexy hat?"
Leslie Knope,Helping already.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Tonight?
Leslie Knope,Several hours from now?
Leslie Knope,I think that would be better.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that would give us more time."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"I think I will, good lady."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, while I have you, can I ask you a question?"
Leslie Knope,What if he asks me if I've been married?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,But then he'll wonder why I haven't been married.
Leslie Knope,You know what I'm gonna do?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say that I was married.
Leslie Knope,"The real question is, should I say that I have kids?"
Leslie Knope,"Guys like girls that have kids, right?"
Leslie Knope,What if I get drunk and I talk about Darfur too much?
Leslie Knope,Or not enough?
Leslie Knope,What if I don't bring up Darfur enough?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I just have a few more questions for you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,What if he shows up with another woman?
Leslie Knope,What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly?
Leslie Knope,"What if instead of Tic Tacs, I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?"
Leslie Knope,They have happened.
Leslie Knope,All of these have happened to me.
Leslie Knope,"No, there's more."
Leslie Knope,"One time, I accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar."
Leslie Knope,I thought it was terrible wine.
Leslie Knope,Once I went out with a guy who wore 3D glasses the entire evening.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, one time I rode in a sidecar on a guy's motorcycle, and the sidecar detached and went down a flight of stairs."
Leslie Knope,"Another time, I went to a really boring movie with a guy, and while I was asleep, he tried to pull out one of my teeth."
Leslie Knope,I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth.
Leslie Knope,"We went out a couple times after that, but then he got weird."
Leslie Knope,"I know it sounds crazy, I'm a grown woman, but I am just not good on first dates."
Leslie Knope,I know what you're thinking.
Leslie Knope,"I wear an earpiece, you sit at a table nearby, you speak into a mic, you tell me what to say on the date."
Leslie Knope,"But let me tell you something, Ann, it never works."
Leslie Knope,That's a way better idea.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Dave, it's me."
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,"So, Dave."
Leslie Knope,Let's begin our conversation.
Leslie Knope,They're possible topics of conversation.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I couldn't think of anything else."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Dave You!"
Leslie Knope,"The Danish call it ""op og ned apparat,"" which literally translated means the ""up and down machine."""
Leslie Knope,Now I'm gonna talk about the local flora and fauna found in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,What's amazing--
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I can't think of anything to ask you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,My mind is blank.
Leslie Knope,How big is it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Dave."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was dropping my niece off."
Leslie Knope,Torple.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,That's not a name.
Leslie Knope,I don't have a niece.
Leslie Knope,My niece's name is Stephanie.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look."
Leslie Knope,There's bread.
Leslie Knope,You want some?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,I got flowers in your soup.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,Just I have to go to the whiz palace.
Leslie Knope,"You know, Dave, the place where you... You know, the toilet thing."
Leslie Knope,It's a bathroom!
Leslie Knope,It's called a bathroom!
Leslie Knope,"Why would you say that, Dave?"
Leslie Knope,"That dog was, like, my best friend."
Leslie Knope,"And when she died, it was one of--"
Leslie Knope,"No, Dave."
Leslie Knope,'Cause you're disgusting.
Leslie Knope,I don't understand why you're being so terrible.
Leslie Knope,We're just two people trying to go on a date.
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be fun.
Leslie Knope,It's just a date.
Leslie Knope,"Well, well, well."
Leslie Knope,You coy bastard.
Leslie Knope,Ann is so awesome.
Leslie Knope,I'm lucky to have a friend who would spend a whole day being so mean to me.
Leslie Knope,Catch.
Leslie Knope,"I don't need your dress anymore, I'm gonna wear my own stuff."
Leslie Knope,Me power.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dave."
Leslie Knope,"No, he's not."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hell, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I am awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and you are, too."
Leslie Knope,"You are, too."
Leslie Knope,"You are, too, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Help, police!"
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know today is today, and it's not tomorrow, but I felt like you should know that I'm awesome, and you're lucky to have me."
Leslie Knope,"And I think our first date tomorrow is gonna go awesome, off the charts amazing."
Leslie Knope,Up top.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's do this bitch!"
Leslie Knope,I'm not scared.
Leslie Knope,Can I come and sit down for a little bit?
Leslie Knope,"Cause I walked here, 'cause... The drinking."
Leslie Knope,I do know.
Leslie Knope,I'm coming inside.
Leslie Knope,"So, move, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You make a better door than a guy.
Leslie Knope,Ann was helping me because I was panicking about tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Just the whole idea of first dates just kind of freak me out.
Leslie Knope,But not anymore.
Leslie Knope,I can't even believe that I was scared to go on a date with you.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you should be scared of me."
Leslie Knope,I think I need to return this sweater.
Leslie Knope,I think it fused with my shirt in the dryer or something.
Leslie Knope,I think it's going pretty well with Dave.
Leslie Knope,He wants me.
Leslie Knope,I can totally tell that he wants me.
Leslie Knope,Did you see my bra?
Leslie Knope,Mmm?
Leslie Knope,"Bee, boop."
Leslie Knope,"Guess what? I'm wearing the hot one tomorrow, the black one."
Leslie Knope,Can I use your bathroom?
Leslie Knope,Are you impressed that I know what it's called?
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, in London, they call elevators ""lifts."""
Leslie Knope,"So, you're gonna give me an elevator home?"
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's go down to the pub.
Leslie Knope,To the pub.
Leslie Knope,get a pint.
Leslie Knope,We'll put our knickers in The Beatles records.
Leslie Knope,This is an English accent.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Leslie Knope,Should I have?
Leslie Knope,God.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I am so sorry for what happened last night.
Leslie Knope,"On my list of embarrassing things that I've done in my life, that was numbers one through seven."
Leslie Knope,I totally understand if you wanna cancel.
Leslie Knope,Second?
Leslie Knope,8 o' clock.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Then we don't have to go.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we went on our first date, and I didn't even know it. A.K.A, I nailed it."
Leslie Knope,"No fires, no ambulances, just good old-fashioned showing up drunk at a guy's house late at night."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I am here to interview for the Deputy Parks Director job."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should have to interview just like everyone else."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if you'll see on my resume, I held the position of deputy director of parks and recreation for almost ten years."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Just interview me.
Leslie Knope,No special treatment.
Leslie Knope,"The ancient Greek version of the park was the agora, a gathering place where people from all walks of life"
Leslie Knope,What are you writing?
Leslie Knope,Is it good?
Leslie Knope,It's right there in the name: Maintaining our beautiful parks and providing healthy outdoor recreation.
Leslie Knope,"Ha, ha, okay."
Leslie Knope,No more goofing around.
Leslie Knope,Just tell me I have the job.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on, it's me."
Leslie Knope,Give me special treatment.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, first morning meeting back in the old conference room."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Leslie Knope,You guys think I'm a border collie?
Leslie Knope,So obviously a cocker spaniel.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,I'm in on the joke.
Leslie Knope,"I get it, but maybe we should stop talking about your insane dog choices and get to working."
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What idea?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, that's great."
Leslie Knope,"No, I mean, the lemonade... never mind."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will start doing an environmental impact study, and Ron, you can do some demographic research."
Leslie Knope,Nothing I can do to help?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I can straighten this for you.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Leslie Knope,I came up with a way better game.
Leslie Knope,Behold your spirit kangaroo.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you are a blue flyer."
Leslie Knope,So am I.
Leslie Knope,So are you and Donna.
Leslie Knope,And look at Ron.
Leslie Knope,Look at Ron.
Leslie Knope,I mean Doesn't Ron look exactly like a blue flyer?
Leslie Knope,There aren't that many different types of kangaroos.
Leslie Knope,"Either way, hell of a game, right, guys?"
Leslie Knope,"Presentations are upon us, so, Tom, which step are you at in The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, no, you cannot drop The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System."
Leslie Knope,It was developed over thousands of government presentations that I gave over the past ten years.
Leslie Knope,It is my very soul.
Leslie Knope,That's your plan?
Leslie Knope,To-- to rip it?
Leslie Knope,"Sure, yeah, you should probably just rip it."
Leslie Knope,"I think that's better than going with a tried and true 80 step system that led to and I quote ""The most thorough and, dare we say, at times, overprepared presentation that we've seen."""
Leslie Knope,"And yeah, that quote came from the Indiana blue ribbon panel on irrigation and drainage."
Leslie Knope,Big kangaroo.
Leslie Knope,And thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, I was gone for a while and things are a little different around here, but this is still my house."
Leslie Knope,"I invented this parks game, son."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Damn it!
Leslie Knope,When did they put a lamp here?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed."
Leslie Knope,Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,You're lying.
Leslie Knope,"I placed a single strand of hair along the edge, and that secret strand is unbroken."
Leslie Knope,"Look, it seems like you don't even care about your presentation."
Leslie Knope,Content.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you need hard data."
Leslie Knope,You need facts to make your case.
Leslie Knope,And then you need two funny quotes and an inspirational one.
Leslie Knope,"You know, a classic ha ha hmm."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine, I trust you."
Leslie Knope,"But I think you're gonna fail, and you're a ticking time bomb."
Leslie Knope,"Nothing, good luck."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,It's the most effective hair for binder security.
Leslie Knope,"You know that, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"If Tom gives that presentation, it is going to be a total disaster for both him and the department."
Leslie Knope,I cannot sit idly by and watch this terrible thing happen.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I can barely sit idly by and watch good things happen."
Leslie Knope,"Now, Stu, I know that you're thinking about retiring, and I am here to ask you to reconsider."
Leslie Knope,What do you say?
Leslie Knope,"Keep that Lafayette Park stand open, pumpin' out the stew like you do."
Leslie Knope,"Stu, you have been a staple in the parks department system for years."
Leslie Knope,Retirement is for the birds.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna be so bored.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say this because you need to hear it.
Leslie Knope,Screw bisque.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're gonna need to convince the business council to keep you around, but that's not for you to worry about."
Leslie Knope,I'll take care of it.
Leslie Knope,You just keep on stewin' what you stew.
Leslie Knope,To stew.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's very hot.
Leslie Knope,"Great news, guys."
Leslie Knope,I just saved your bacon.
Leslie Knope,"I know you were excited to get in front of the committee and rip it, but in the spirit of teamwork, I unilaterally decided to bring Stu out of retirement."
Leslie Knope,So pressure's off.
Leslie Knope,"Doin' what, putting mousse in your hair?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I use the juicy space thing-- whatever you do."
Leslie Knope,"The point is you weren't ready for this, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"I'm still doing my stew presentation, and we'll see which one the committee likes."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I love Tom, but you and I both know that he's not ready to step up."
Leslie Knope,Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil?
Leslie Knope,The botched laser show?
Leslie Knope,Larry still can't see purple.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but still, Tom is all flash and no substance."
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, it's because of Stu."
Leslie Knope,"Here's a man who was ready to retire, spend time with his family, travel."
Leslie Knope,"And then he realized, ""No, I wanna spend my time in a small metal box all summer, bent over a boiling cauldron of steaming, bubbling meat."""
Leslie Knope,"Making stew is hard: Up at the crack of dawn, backbreaking labor, your clothes smelling like salt and gristle."
Leslie Knope,"Sure, profits are minimal, but Stu doesn't care about that."
Leslie Knope,Maybe a year extension isn't enough.
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should make it five years.
Leslie Knope,"Heck, why don't we give him a lifetime deal?"
Leslie Knope,I'd like to see Stu ladling out his pungent beef smoothies until we bury him under that shed.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Rip it.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, you were right."
Leslie Knope,Tom has really grown up.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom's come into his own."
Leslie Knope,April runs Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, does this department even need me anymore?"
Leslie Knope,Was that a death threat?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that reminds me."
Leslie Knope,"I know you don't open your mail, but I do."
Leslie Knope,"And because you created Tom's position-- business liaison-- and it's already financially paying off, you have received Pawnee's government employee of the month."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it has taken--"
Leslie Knope,"Thank you very much, Mr. City Manager."
Leslie Knope,And I have to say that the way that you're rockin' those slacks is quite impressive as well.
Leslie Knope,"I am back at the parks department, and Ben is city manager, but we're married, so it's kosher."
Leslie Knope,And awesome.
Leslie Knope,We live together
Leslie Knope,And we are so In sync
Leslie Knope,Sentences!
Leslie Knope,We rehearsed that at home.
Leslie Knope,Naked in bed.
Leslie Knope,What!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's great news, 'cause I'm in love with you too."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's not let Ron feel left out."
Leslie Knope,"We love you too, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Group hug!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I think our love made him angry.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Opening this farmers market was one of my greatest achievements as city councilor.
Leslie Knope,"It's good for the economy, it's good for families, and it's good for promoting a healthy lifestyle, which Pawnee desperately needs."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Connie Cabbage."
Leslie Knope,What's good today?
Leslie Knope,What the hell is going on?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, do something."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're the city manager."
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.
Leslie Knope,They're violating every single one of the farmers market's rules of conduct.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and ""In case of fire, romaine calm,"" and ""You won't bay leaf how nice olive our vendors are."""
Leslie Knope,"I don't like vegetables, but I'm very good at vegetable puns."
Leslie Knope,A little iffy?
Leslie Knope,"Connie, no."
Leslie Knope,Put those away.
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I was thinking more about that chard guy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it would be very easy for you to revoke their license."
Leslie Knope,The reason is it's vegetable porn.
Leslie Knope,Porn on the cob.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm just very good at that.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am not a prude, but the point is, people shouldn't be half naked, you know, in public, in the middle of the day, in front of children."
Leslie Knope,There's your reason.
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,That's smart.
Leslie Knope,"Home is home, and work is work."
Leslie Knope,We can always talk about this tomorrow at the office.
Leslie Knope,"Mmhmm, yeah, uh-huh."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I found a legal precedent to shut down those vegetable smut peddlers."
Leslie Knope,"Firewall, man."
Leslie Knope,"We pulled into the parking lot, and this is technically city hall property, so now we're at work let's do this."
Leslie Knope,"The farmers market is a community meeting place, and that pansexual stripper show basically negates the whole purpose."
Leslie Knope,"So if you're looking for a reason to kick them out, here's 158."
Leslie Knope,The new farmers market rule book.
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night.
Leslie Knope,I also made these: Leslie's toffee surprise.
Leslie Knope,The surprise is there's toffee in the inside.
Leslie Knope,You can eat those once you revoke the chard vendor's license.
Leslie Knope,"Good day, colleague."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, did you get a chance to sign off on that booklet I gave you?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Those apply to all vendors.
Leslie Knope,"Either way, it's too late."
Leslie Knope,The train has left the station.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Nolan, under the auspices of the office of city manager, et cetera, et cetera, it's not important, you are in violation of many rules, and therefore you cannot sell your goods anymore at the Pawnee farmers market."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, back me up on this without hesitation."
Leslie Knope,I like to think of it as celery with B.O.
Leslie Knope,"But if it's so gross, you should just sell something else."
Leslie Knope,Judas!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I know what you're trying to do.
Leslie Knope,"If we go home, the firewall is up, and then you don't have to deal with me anymore."
Leslie Knope,"Instead, fellow employee, I will meet you in the basement conference room at 6:00 P.M."
Leslie Knope,And we will solve this chard issue once and for all.
Leslie Knope,Don't forget your approval pen.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there is."
Leslie Knope,I made it for you last night.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, 6:00."
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,Larry?
Leslie Knope,Read.
Leslie Knope,What the hell are you doing out here?
Leslie Knope,Wrong.
Leslie Knope,"All roads and bridges fall under the purview of the Pawnee department of transportation, which is located on the fourth floor of city hall."
Leslie Knope,Firewall down.
Leslie Knope,"Stay frosty, Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,We're just getting started.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Mother
Leslie Knope,Hahaha!
Leslie Knope,The concrete that you're standing on was poured by a municipal construction crew.
Leslie Knope,Guess where the water comes from.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee reservoir.
Leslie Knope,"You can't escape city hall, fool!"
Leslie Knope,Let's dance.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is insane."
Leslie Knope,"It is 40 degrees, and we are standing in freezing water."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Why are you not supporting me on this?
Leslie Knope,I thought you agreed with me.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That is totally crazy!
Leslie Knope,I am super chill all the time!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's nice."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,I should have considered your side.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and you're also a very smart person."
Leslie Knope,I can't because my legs are numb.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Nolan, I'm very sorry that I overreacted and overstepped my bounds."
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody, it is now 5:00 P.M., which means the farmers market is closed."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's like a tree barfed in my mouth."
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, you can't?"
Leslie Knope,"Look I am throwing a farewell party for my best friend, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"And if she casually mentioned 3 years ago that she thought indoor fireworks would be cool then guess what, you're gonna give me indoor fireworks."
Leslie Knope,Tonight's biggest surprise is 5 years in the making.
Leslie Knope,It all goes back to when I first met my best friend.
Leslie Knope,I will help you.
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.
Leslie Knope,That promise launched a friendship so grand it takes 103 scrapbooks to capture it.
Leslie Knope,"I have secretly arranged to officially break ground on Pawnee commons at midnight, fulfilling my pinky promise that I made five years ago."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, ice cream sandwich taste test!"
Leslie Knope,That was our biggest fight.
Leslie Knope,Harold.
Leslie Knope,"Look, your office was giving me a hard time, so I had to call in a few favors."
Leslie Knope,Understood.
Leslie Knope,I will make a note of that.
Leslie Knope,Would you like a treat?
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,There's gonna be a lot of these at the party.
Leslie Knope,You should come by.
Leslie Knope,Hazelnut.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, right?"
Leslie Knope,See you tonight.
Leslie Knope,"April, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"I know you may tease Ann, but deep down inside I can tell that you really care."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't mention anything about the groundbreaking to Ann."
Leslie Knope,Repeat that back to me.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Bon voyage, Ann."
Leslie Knope,That's sparkling cider.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know when we're gonna be able to visit each other, so just to be safe this party is a celebration of every event that's gonna happen this year."
Leslie Knope,"Your birthday, New Year's, Chinese New Year's, flag day."
Leslie Knope,Ain't no party like a Leslie Knope party 'cause a Leslie Knope party is actually 30 parties.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, party!"
Leslie Knope,Don't drink!
Leslie Knope,Have fun!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron, have you seen April?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Are you on the lot?
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?
Leslie Knope,That probably doesn't apply to us.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie Knope is a very common name."
Leslie Knope,There's a professor in Copenhagen named Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,They probably mean him.
Leslie Knope,Do they mean the professor?
Leslie Knope,Holy mother of Malia!
Leslie Knope,And Sasha.
Leslie Knope,I love them both equally.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's that stupid Harold who's behind this."
Leslie Knope,Get here and we will make a plan.
Leslie Knope,"Until I say so, Orin!"
Leslie Knope,Stay in character.
Leslie Knope,"Harold, it is Leslie Knope again."
Leslie Knope,"I know you are screening my calls, but if you could call me bac;k-- And his voicemail is full."
Leslie Knope,Did you have any luck?
Leslie Knope,What is the point of being married to a city manager if he can't wield unfettered power to crush my enemies?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,We were planning a surprise groundbreaking at Pawnee commons for you.
Leslie Knope,"You know, an actual beginning to the project that brought us together."
Leslie Knope,But now we can't do it because Harold is such a jerk face.
Leslie Knope,He put a barbed wire fence around the lot and now it's not happening.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Ann Perkins to the rescue.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hands in, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,Groundbreaking!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I didn't plan what we were all gonna say."
Leslie Knope,That's my bad.
Leslie Knope,"Here we go, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, knock or ring the bell?"
Leslie Knope,Love it!
Leslie Knope,Harold.
Leslie Knope,We need the key to the fence that you put up on the Sullivan Street lot.
Leslie Knope,Sorry?
Leslie Knope,Easy.
Leslie Knope,It is not easy.
Leslie Knope,Kathryn Pinewood is the person on earth who hates me the most.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's perfect."
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,Don't leave.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Kathryn, always a delight."
Leslie Knope,How dare you--
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Perkins."
Leslie Knope,I don't think this new sports drink is even about basketball.
Leslie Knope,"We know that you were already approached by Sweetums and you said ""No,"" but is there any way you would reconsider?"
Leslie Knope,For old time's sake?
Leslie Knope,Does that mean-- no!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky minx."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,It was absolutely the right call.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so we got Perd Hapley to sign on with Sweetums, which means that you get your sodas back, which means that we get our key."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Everything's here in writing.
Leslie Knope,Now call off your guards.
Leslie Knope,"Harold, your tiny brain could not understand this, but that is the best compliment you could ever give the two women standing in front of you."
Leslie Knope,Victory at last.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I am gonna call the official ceremonial ribbon cutting guy, 'cause I think we may have missed him."
Leslie Knope,It's for the raccoons.
Leslie Knope,You have to hiss really loud and stomp your feet so they'll leave you alone.
Leslie Knope,"And if one comes close, make yourself really large like a puffer fish."
Leslie Knope,Did I miss a nice moment?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,Can I still call you when I have thoughts on Jennifer Aniston's future?
Leslie Knope,And can we still be on the phone for every state of the Union address and every Oscar red carpet coverage and every single viewing of Tootsie?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,You perfect sunflower.
Leslie Knope,"You totally changed me, you know? You taught me how to balance my life, how to be patient."
Leslie Knope,How to be more patient.
Leslie Knope,How to throw bureaucratic caution to the wind when it came to Ben.
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, you taught me that I can't pull off a tulip skirt."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't think this ceremonial ribbon cutting guy is gonna make it."
Leslie Knope,Either he flaked or he tripped and impaled himself on his own giant scissors.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three!"
Leslie Knope,"Don't even joke about that, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Chris Traeger.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, and I just want you to know that I thought there was no man on earth good enough for Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,And I still think that.
Leslie Knope,"But if there is no one actually good enough for her, you are pretty damn close."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, this is normal."
Leslie Knope,No big deal.
Leslie Knope,Drive safe.
Leslie Knope,I packed you some sandwiches and some caffeine free iced tea.
Leslie Knope,"So-- oh, and there's a mix CD that I made already loaded in your car."
Leslie Knope,"There's a lot of Sarah McLanahan, so, Chris, I apologize."
Leslie Knope,Things are gonna get emotional.
Leslie Knope,I love you too.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,That's fair.
Leslie Knope,Someone else is gonna have to drive though.
Leslie Knope,My eyes are basically useless right now.
Leslie Knope,Raise you hand if you want waffles.
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt were married one year ago this week at the Pawnee city hall."""
Leslie Knope,"""The bride wore a gown made by her friend Ann Perkins."""
Leslie Knope,"""And the groom wore a butt so perfect it could make an angel hang itself."""
Leslie Knope,"You wrote this, didn't you?"
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,They cut it way down.
Leslie Knope,At lease 100 kisses.
Leslie Knope,Dinner at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,And no gifts.
Leslie Knope,No gifts.
Leslie Knope,No gifts.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm getting him a gift."
Leslie Knope,I always say that I'm not gonna get him a gift.
Leslie Knope,And Ben always believes me.
Leslie Knope,"And then, bam, I surprise him with the best gift of all time."
Leslie Knope,"He makes the cutest, dopiest face when he's surprised."
Leslie Knope,It's like Whaaaat?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just want to say thank you so much for having me."
Leslie Knope,It's a thrill to be here.
Leslie Knope,"As a listener, I think the merging of your two shows has really created such a big, quiet, arcane ball of fun."
Leslie Knope,It's been a couple of months since Pawnee and Eagleton officially merged.
Leslie Knope,Things are going... okay.
Leslie Knope,There's still a little animosity between the two towns.
Leslie Knope,I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad since Frankie's discontinued their pizza stuffed crust pizza.
Leslie Knope,It was a pizza whose crust was stuffed with little pizzas.
Leslie Knope,And the crust of those little pizzas was made of chocolate.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there were some bumps and bruises."
Leslie Knope,And a brief rash of arson.
Leslie Knope,And a rather large-scale brawl at the dump.
Leslie Knope,"But overall, the state of the merger is very strong."
Leslie Knope,"Did you just say the word ""scoff""?"
Leslie Knope,Guys... Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, caller."
Leslie Knope,You have a comment?
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, there has been some confusion with some of the garbage routes."
Leslie Knope,And the Sanitation Department is stretched a little thin.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's what the merger is."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know who this is, but I agree."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this merger needs a win-- something symbolic and bright and happy that will show that there's light at the end of the tunnel."
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so stressed."
Leslie Knope,"Now is not the time, Larry."
Leslie Knope,Please leave.
Leslie Knope,Larry!
Leslie Knope,What are you still doing here?
Leslie Knope,I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton were as happy as Ben and me.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, this is a picture of us."
Leslie Knope,This is a picture of an elderly couple.
Leslie Knope,Rosie and Doug DeMarco.
Leslie Knope,They've been married for 50 years.
Leslie Knope,"""Rosie Hails from Pawnee, while Doug is originally from the former Eagleton."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is perfect."
Leslie Knope,A Pawnee Eagleton couple that has been married for 50 years is a perfect symbol of how our towns can get along.
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna hold them up as an example of Pawnee Eagleton unity.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,I'm getting the epiphany sweats.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, obviously, we don't really know these people, so let's keep things fun and positive and celebratory, and mergery."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mrs. DeMarco, I am Leslie Knope, and we saw your announcement in the newspaper and we would love to treat you and your husband to a very special day."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, you didn't win any money, you won something better than money."
Leslie Knope,A golden anniversary celebration.
Leslie Knope,"No, and I'm now just realizing how misleading this giant check is."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you did, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Now is not the time.
Leslie Knope,We-- Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,We'll give you some money.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Here, here's some money."
Leslie Knope,Everybody give 'em money.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,Let's get started!
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, babe."
Leslie Knope,I'm not even in my office.
Leslie Knope,I'm out saving the merger.
Leslie Knope,Can it wait?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at dinner.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you two, head on up there."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna recreate your wedding photo from 50 years ago.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm kind of worried about putting these two on live TV.
Leslie Knope,They're sort of grumpy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's just hope that deep down these two still love each other."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, isn't this exciting?"
Leslie Knope,"In just a few minutes, you are going to be professing your love on television."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, the playful banter of a couple on the same team."
Leslie Knope,"That's what this is, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Joan, if we could just have a moment."
Leslie Knope,We need to get ready.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,I'm going to admit something.
Leslie Knope,"I orchestrated the Pawnee Eagleton merger, and I was hoping that your marriage could show people that a happy union is possible."
Leslie Knope,"So when you're out there, if you could just, you know, look back over the past 50 years together and focus on the good times, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Isn't love grand?
Leslie Knope,"50 years of marriage, helping to bridge the meaningless divide between Pawnee and Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"No, I--"
Leslie Knope,Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We all agree that marriages have their ups and downs, but at the end of the day, they're worth it becauseâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Who likes tap dancing?
Leslie Knope,"Gah, I don't know what to do."
Leslie Knope,I wish Ben was here.
Leslie Knope,What is he doing right now?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Maybe Pawneeans and Eagletonians aren't meant to coexist.
Leslie Knope,Cheers.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,The children.
Leslie Knope,The children are our future.
Leslie Knope,"Whitney Houston knew it, and so do you, and so do I."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna need your help on something.
Leslie Knope,I think we should go to work
Leslie Knope,But not now.
Leslie Knope,We're having dinner.
Leslie Knope,"Damn, this paella is good."
Leslie Knope,Did you put saffron in here? It makes the shellfish taste delicious.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, the people in this room are the first members of the Pawnee Eagleton Youth Committee."
Leslie Knope,"Now, April says that young people think the word ""committee"" is lame, so let's just think of this as a like a super chill, fun e-hangout."
Leslie Knope,"You are going to meet twice a week and you're here because of your energy, and your youth, and for some of you, your mental age, and you're going to find a way to make this merger stick."
Leslie Knope,So we are gonna order you some 'zzas.
Leslie Knope,"You get to B.S.-ing, brainstorming."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so it's been an hour."
Leslie Knope,"From out there, it looks like you guys were having some fun, getting to know each other."
Leslie Knope,So why don't we call this first meeting a success and then we'll get together later in the week.
Leslie Knope,I don't-- I don't-- I don't even-- You know what I mean?
Leslie Knope,"You guys, that's like-- I don't know-- Amazing."
Leslie Knope,Like-- what you do there.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ahem.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my eff-ing God."
Leslie Knope,You planned all of this for me? An enchanted carriage? This is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and your scrapbook instincts are really good."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, this is a little rough, but you have a lot of talent here."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,About that.
Leslie Knope,Happy anniversary.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,I had a guy at the model store make a replica.
Leslie Knope,He's a bigger Game of Thrones fan than you are.
Leslie Knope,Our starship is in trouble.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Enough's enough.
Leslie Knope,Let's talk plans for Diane's baby shower.
Leslie Knope,"Three main activities: baby bingo, baby food tasting, and my personal favorite baby onesie decorating station."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make mine look like an astronaut.
Leslie Knope,"What are you doing up there in space, baby?"
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,So cute!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I have some gift ideas.
Leslie Knope,I was looking at a very adorable stroller.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shoot."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to think of something else.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, whose baby is that?"
Leslie Knope,"Guys, get in here!"
Leslie Knope,Ron has a baby!
Leslie Knope,"How am I supposed to keep my voice down when you had your baby, and you didn't tell me that you had your baby?"
Leslie Knope,"Why would I-- oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I have not even sent Diane a gift.
Leslie Knope,"She's just walking around, wondering why I haven't sent her a gift yet."
Leslie Knope,When did you get a fish?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, youth committee."
Leslie Knope,Update on the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Madison.
Leslie Knope,Stop suggesting Orin.
Leslie Knope,"Craig, any update on the art tents?"
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Eagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town."
Leslie Knope,"But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success, Pawnee might once again tolerate slash ignore me."
Leslie Knope,"I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario."
Leslie Knope,You guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.
Leslie Knope,I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.
Leslie Knope,No one knows who that is?
Leslie Knope,"No, Grant Larson is the director of the Midwest branch of the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,He's basically the Liam Bonneville of the Midwest.
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville?
Leslie Knope,The department of the interior's resident bad boy?
Leslie Knope,"He's basically the Tim Dweck-- Okay, never mind."
Leslie Knope,I have asked Grant to declare Eagleton Hills a national park as the grand finale of our unity concert.
Leslie Knope,"And with that update, the Pawnee new founder's day unity concert is now officially ahead of schedule!"
Leslie Knope,And that banner unfurling marks the 100th time that one of my projects has been ahead of schedule.
Leslie Knope,Here we are the park that borders Pawnee and Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect place for the press conference to announce our unity concert.
Leslie Knope,"People are gonna clap, they're gonna cheer."
Leslie Knope,Today might be the day that I finally crowd surf.
Leslie Knope,I should probably empty my pockets just in case.
Leslie Knope,I painted over that graffiti a week ago.
Leslie Knope,These people are the worst!
Leslie Knope,I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.
Leslie Knope,"You know, why do we even have this wall?"
Leslie Knope,"We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them."
Leslie Knope,We should just knock it down.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, everyone, for coming."
Leslie Knope,And a special thank you to the city council for their support.
Leslie Knope,Just take some beef jerky and hush!
Leslie Knope,This spring we will be holding a massive unity concert to commemorate the merger between Pawnee and Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"This three day music and arts festival will end on a day we will call ""New Founder's Day,"" an official beginning to our new town."
Leslie Knope,"A few years ago, Eagleton put up this wall along the border."
Leslie Knope,Now it is time to tear down this wall.
Leslie Knope,"In the name of unity, I have given some former Eagletonians the first strike."
Leslie Knope,"Take it away, guys."
Leslie Knope,This is such a great day for--
Leslie Knope,Bees!
Leslie Knope,Bees!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Nobody panic!
Leslie Knope,I didn't pull anything off.
Leslie Knope,The Eagletonians were simply closest to the wall.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, one Pawneean was stung in his mouth because he was laughing at the Eagletonians."
Leslie Knope,"They were not my bees, Trodd."
Leslie Knope,And for the last time this was not a prank.
Leslie Knope,I did not know that bees were in that wall.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, in fact you should treat this like a public service announcement."
Leslie Knope,Everybodyâ¦ should check their walls for bees.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's all the time I have."
Leslie Knope,I cannot meet with him right now.
Leslie Knope,"We are in crisis mode, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Larry, just tell him I need to reschedule because I am trying to fix my bee hole disaster."
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"No, wait!"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Larry, don't tell him that."
Leslie Knope,Don't mention my bee hole.
Leslie Knope,"This merger is so fragile, everyone is on edge, and no one is talking about the unity concert."
Leslie Knope,Why would anybody think that was a prank?
Leslie Knope,"April, your competence and your levelheadedness is very moving to me, and I will follow your advice right after I go to the hospital and apologize to every victim in person."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I won't bring any."
Leslie Knope,I'm so incredibly sorry.
Leslie Knope,I hope you look a lot less gross very soon.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,These gift baskets are for innocent victims not for jerks who got stung because they were laughing at other people's pain.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,These are your cameras.
Leslie Knope,This is not a publicity stunt.
Leslie Knope,I just came here by myself to apologize to all the Eagletonians who got stung.
Leslie Knope,Pawneeans and Eagletonians need to find a way to come together and bury the hatchet.
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter who bailed out who, or who seceded from you."
Leslie Knope,Mine.
Leslie Knope,It was my idea.
Leslie Knope,No fighting in a hospital.
Leslie Knope,There shouldn't be fighting in a hospital!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Motherâ¦ puncher!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, girl."
Leslie Knope,What up?
Leslie Knope,It's to distract people from my black eye.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,It's working.
Leslie Knope,How is any of that good news?
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, April."
Leslie Knope,It's fine.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a challenge."
Leslie Knope,"It's just like a big, fun... stinking turd nugget."
Leslie Knope,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, everything sucks."
Leslie Knope,Everything I try with this merger backfires.
Leslie Knope,I wonder what other excellent surprise lies in store for Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,Now I shall meet with a very important person whilst sporting a gruesome shiner.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes!"
Leslie Knope,I am!
Leslie Knope,Wonderful!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,I had to reschedule.
Leslie Knope,It's been kind of a hectic week.
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,I would like to apply to turn some of our new land into a national park.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this week just keeps getting better and better."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.
Leslie Knope,Really? You know who I am?
Leslie Knope,You read my proposal to clean up the Pawnee river? I wrote this two years ago.
Leslie Knope,Liam B-- You don't have to tell me!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you have no idea how meaningful it is to hear you say that."
Leslie Knope,But you're a little late.
Leslie Knope,The river cleanup's well underway.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,I come here to think sometimes.
Leslie Knope,By myself.
Leslie Knope,But now that you're hereâ¦
Leslie Knope,"I am going to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that I have, and you cannot ask me any questions or details about it."
Leslie Knope,"Look, you know how much I love Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,But the more I try to fix it the more people fight me.
Leslie Knope,"They call me names, they recall me, they try to kill the merger."
Leslie Knope,They literally punch me in the face.
Leslie Knope,"And yet every time I contemplate leaving, just walking away once and for all, I just can't do it."
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with me?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, man, you are lucky."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What the hell? I need your help.
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,It's a story about a radiator.
Leslie Knope,He is a beautiful boy.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Leslie Knope,I've been thinking about your offer.
Leslie Knope,And I have to say I can't think of one single reason not to take it.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I meant because I can think of a lot of reasons not to take it."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"It's an amazing offer and I'm very interested, but if I'm going to leave Pawnee I need to know it's gonna be okay without me."
Leslie Knope,And I won't know until I finish what I've started.
Leslie Knope,When do you need your answer?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That's not your hand.
Leslie Knope,Here it is.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, my depth perception is totally screwed up."
Leslie Knope,"You can pay parking tickets, you can apply for a business license and the best part is we're going to put up an online poll so people can pick the new town slogan!"
Leslie Knope,"Guys, Ben worked really hard on this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's look at the online polls.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a cool way to choose our new town's slogan.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,The panda holds a paddle with his tail.
Leslie Knope,I want to play!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. Larson."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for meeting me here.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to check this out.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the reason why I asked you to meet me here"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Martha?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna need two hours worth of waffles.
Leslie Knope,Grant Larson has offered me a chance to oversee a branch office of the national park service.
Leslie Knope,This is like the parks equivalent of Bruce Springsteen pulling Courtney Cox onstage.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, one minute you're just a regular girl in the crowd, and the next minute you're dancing 10 feet away from freakin' Max Weinberg!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth from last question is about the Heartland Exotic Plant Management Project."
Leslie Knope,"Now, were would I be actually doing the physical planting?"
Leslie Knope,"Because it is always been a dream of mine to plant spotted jewelweed along the red river bank in Arkansas, but I'm sure you hear that a lot."
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,I hate paperwork.
Leslie Knope,I hardly ever do it in my bed on a Saturday night while listening to old spice girls CDs.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, totally."
Leslie Knope,"Grant is great, the job is great."
Leslie Knope,The waffles were great.
Leslie Knope,"Now that Eagleton and Pawnee have merged, it is time to pick a new town slogan."
Leslie Knope,And a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town's identity.
Leslie Knope,"There is New York, the city that never sleeps."
Leslie Knope,"And then there is Glenwater, Florida, home of America's most violent Walmart parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so people can vote now."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're not gonna do that."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.
Leslie Knope,"There's a lot of nitty-gritty left to do, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass."
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?
Leslie Knope,"We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them."
Leslie Knope,"This press junket is a brilliant idea, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Mr. Strange Cameraman Who I Never Met.
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here."
Leslie Knope,"So true, Perd."
Leslie Knope,"All of the choices for the town slogan are wonderful, but if I had to choose my favorite it would probably be ""Storied past, bright future."""
Leslie Knope,"Joan, this poll is a chance to give our newly merged city a new identity to really rebrand this town."
Leslie Knope,"Isn't ""Juan"" a man's name?"
Leslie Knope,"I think it means ""John."""
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, yes, I do."
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,What's leading?
Leslie Knope,"""Storied past, bright future""?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Because every election has a write-in option.
Leslie Knope,That's how democracy works.
Leslie Knope,I'm not a dictator.
Leslie Knope,"If I we're a dictator, I would throw the Douche in prison without a trial."
Leslie Knope,"I would be a very strong dictator, and you would be my bodyguard, and you would lead my army."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to do this."
Leslie Knope,I enjoy the challenge.
Leslie Knope,"So, how do I look?"
Leslie Knope,"I need these guys to think that I'm, like, super chill."
Leslie Knope,Classic!
Leslie Knope,No way!
Leslie Knope,"I'm not here to nag, guys."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just psyched to be in the studio, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I'm justâ¦ chillin' in the studes with my dudes.
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would rate her acting as an ""A."""
Leslie Knope,From charity?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,A minus.
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,Hard to believe this is a fan game for your radio listeners.
Leslie Knope,Ahâ¦ I'm gonna say butt.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,I don't know how you got yours hand on that.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it is been so fun broing out with my dogs."
Leslie Knope,I never knew that objectifying women could be so much fun.
Leslie Knope,Or you know what would also be kind of dope for the people of Douche nation to do?
Leslie Knope,It's vote for another slogan.
Leslie Knope,"Like, you know, ""Storied past, bright future""?"
Leslie Knope,Butâ¦ I don't care.
Leslie Knope,"I don't give a fart, bros."
Leslie Knope,"You know, just do your thing, chicken wing."
Leslie Knope,You--
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, I almost pulled that off."
Leslie Knope,"Or, maybe we sneak back in there you distract those guys for, like, 30, 90 minutes, I get on live radio, I give an impassioned speech about what slogan I want to endorse and I play a few songs, which I always wanted to do, and then we just see what happens."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I should just let this go.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom told you are sort of like a computer expert."
Leslie Knope,"These jerks are trying to hijack my online poll, and so far the leading town slogan is, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt."""
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wondering, is there a way I can communicate with everybody who voted?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,You wanted to see me?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, no worries, I will handle all of the overflow work personally."
Leslie Knope,"Parking tickets, code violations... send them all to me."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I spoke to grant about the national parks job, and he mentioned that's mostly big picture planning and delegating, and not very much nitty-gritty, hands on stuff that I love to do."
Leslie Knope,"I would miss that, very much."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have I really pulled my last bloated raccoon carcass from a public fountain?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,I guess I should practice delegating.
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,The public forum will be run byâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I would not have started the sentence if I knew Larry was the only one here."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Larry, can you get in here?"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to a public forum to choose our new town slogan."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna hand things over to Larry Gengurch, who is 100% in charge."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you-- Hm--there's--that's--that's spelled wrong."
Leslie Knope,"That should be ""then"", t-h-e-n."
Leslie Knope,Trust Larry?
Leslie Knope,Are you listening to yourself?
Leslie Knope,Back off.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, she made a possessive."
Leslie Knope,She's getting further away.
Leslie Knope,I held it together for the entire meeting.
Leslie Knope,Let me have this one.
Leslie Knope,I'm done micromanaging.
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Leslie Knope,"What? No! Oh, son of a--"
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, there's something else I'm worried about."
Leslie Knope,"The kind of work that I've been doing all these years, the nuts and bolts, the grunt work, that's the stuff I know how to do."
Leslie Knope,What if I take this national parks jobs and I justâ¦ fail?
Leslie Knope,What if I'm not good at it?
Leslie Knope,You're--
Leslie Knope,"The only thing I am crazy about is a magnificent, pregnant manta ray named Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,I am ranking topics of conversation for our next phone call.
Leslie Knope,The worst part about your best friend living in another stupid state is the topics really pile up.
Leslie Knope,What do you think should be higher priority?
Leslie Knope,Infinity scarves or whether or not it's worth it for me to get Showtime?
Leslie Knope,"When she moved, we promised each other that we would talk every day, and we've really fallen behind."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, babe, you can'tâ¦ you would just embarrass yourself."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, every time I start talking to you, five seconds later, I want to jump your bones."
Leslie Knope,"See, that's what I'm talking about."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay, let's do this."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,On to the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Ben is meeting with the tent people to finalize those deals.
Leslie Knope,"April and Donna will be helping me with the vendor location charts, and I will be meeting with the surveyors about the concert grounds."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I always knew there would be a day when I would get through to you and you would love government work.
Leslie Knope,Today is that historic day.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Andy, why don't you go with Ron and help him?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, ladies, I will be in my office for one to seven hours for my weekly chat with Ann."
Leslie Knope,I brought some fresh snacks.
Leslie Knope,"And I made a backup plan for the vendor chart in case, you know, yours isn't good."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"God, why'd you let me say all that?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm coming, Ann's voice mail!"
Leslie Knope,I'm coming!
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what they'd make you say.
Leslie Knope,Donna.
Leslie Knope,"What's good, baby?"
Leslie Knope,What's going down in Donna town?
Leslie Knope,What's the haps in Meaglewood?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't let me interrupt."
Leslie Knope,"April, what's the 411, little mama?"
Leslie Knope,What's the hot goss?
Leslie Knope,Who you crushing on these days?
Leslie Knope,Work?
Leslie Knope,You can work whenever.
Leslie Knope,"Except for now, because now is lady time."
Leslie Knope,I'm setting up an impromptu Galentine's day.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Her name is Ann, and she is gone, and I have accepted it, and we are gonna have Galentine's day."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, up front."
Leslie Knope,"I need an Ann who lives in Pawnee, and there is no one obvious candidate, so I will test them out on the ultimate battlefield of female friendship Galentine's day brunch."
Leslie Knope,It will be a women's only marathon bonding session with tons of whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,"Side note, do not Google that phrase."
Leslie Knope,"Shauna, I'm so glad you could make it."
Leslie Knope,You're so tan.
Leslie Knope,Oof.
Leslie Knope,When did you go to Asia?
Leslie Knope,You have a jacuzzi?
Leslie Knope,Good to know.
Leslie Knope,Prospects for new Pawnee best friend.
Leslie Knope,Donna Meagle.
Leslie Knope,"Confident, worldly, we go way back."
Leslie Knope,April Ludgate.
Leslie Knope,"Vivid imagination, young, and vibrant."
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Pretty, fragile, makes terrible life decisions."
Leslie Knope,"A real fixer-upper, but look, it's not like Ann was doing so hot when I met her."
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.
Leslie Knope,Bit of a dark horse.
Leslie Knope,"Crotchety, but probably wise."
Leslie Knope,"And then we got Evelyn, aka fake Ann."
Leslie Knope,I don't know her last name.
Leslie Knope,Honestly we just needed bodies.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, everyone, for getting together on such short notice, and happy Galentine's day."
Leslie Knope,"Now, this is not technically the right date, but any time a group of women get together for brunch, we embody the spirit of the holiday."
Leslie Knope,"Today we will celebrate friendship, spend a few hours together, and answer a couple of questions I've compiled."
Leslie Knope,Just for fun.
Leslie Knope,Nothing serious.
Leslie Knope,But please answer them with complete honesty 'cause I'll be able to tell if you're lying.
Leslie Knope,To girlfriends!
Leslie Knope,Whoohoo!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's time for a little Galentine's day Q&A."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you pick first."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,The correct answer for favorite TV show is Friday Night Lights.
Leslie Knope,Next question.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Wild card option.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, anybody reveal anything about their life, anything at all."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Ethel, have you --Okay, Ethel's asleep."
Leslie Knope,Shauna?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I can work with that."
Leslie Knope,Just jotting down memories in my trusty old journal.
Leslie Knope,It's not what it sounds like.
Leslie Knope,It's simply a way for me to figure out which one of you is the best.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, why are you angry?"
Leslie Knope,You were in first place.
Leslie Knope,Leave the bag.
Leslie Knope,"Well, by default, it's Shauna."
Leslie Knope,"That's how you want to find your new best friend, right?"
Leslie Knope,By default?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we find something, anything, no matter how small, that we have in common?"
Leslie Knope,"For example, I'm an only child."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, we both went to college."
Leslie Knope,There's that.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Ann had her baby!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this has been fun."
Leslie Knope,The bill is already paid.
Leslie Knope,May I gently suggest that you check out Chris Traeger's wonderful therapist Dr. Richard Nygard.
Leslie Knope,Although there is a tiny part of me that always thought it was just Chris talking into a mirror.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, maybe you should look him up."
Leslie Knope,That doesn't apply to therapy.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Good luck!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, he's so beautiful."
Leslie Knope,And you're so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're always beautiful, but right now you are the most beautiful, glowing sun goddess ever."
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell me you were in labor?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm glad I'm here now."
Leslie Knope,Where's Chris?
Leslie Knope,"Mm, I don't want to drive back."
Leslie Knope,I miss you so much.
Leslie Knope,No one even comes close to you as a friend.
Leslie Knope,"I even tried to rank the women at work, but that was a total bust."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought maybe I could use Galentine's day as an opportunity--"
Leslie Knope,"What do you want me to do, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"I need to find a replacement, and don't worry, it didn't work."
Leslie Knope,Nobody can match your ethnic hybrid energy.
Leslie Knope,You shut your mouth.
Leslie Knope,You have all the strengths.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause Riggins is a criminal."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, he didn't watch out for his brother."
Leslie Knope,That family is garbage.
Leslie Knope,"I know, you're right, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"It's just I'm missing you, and there's so much stuff I want to talk to you about."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I think Oliver has more pressing business.
Leslie Knope,"What? Ann, you're somebody's mother."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna give you two some time.
Leslie Knope,I'll call you from the car.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, black coffee with extra grounds."
Leslie Knope,Gross.
Leslie Knope,For April.
Leslie Knope,And a mocha ice blended for Donna.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I totally blew it."
Leslie Knope,"I was all screwed up, and I'm really sorry."
Leslie Knope,"You're wonderful friends, and I love you."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,I'll take it.
Leslie Knope,I'm very lucky to have you both.
Leslie Knope,"You know, when Ann and I used to fight, we would make up with a five-minute hug."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's fine."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, we'll forge our own unique traditions in the fiery cauldron of female friendship."
Leslie Knope,"Sweetheart, stop."
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Leslie Knope,"Baby, relax."
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to surprise you.
Leslie Knope,Open the bottom drawer and read the cake.
Leslie Knope,"Because of the merger, schools have had to make some cuts, and the first thing to go was the senior prom."
Leslie Knope,"So as a last minute hail Mary, the parks department is throwing prom for them."
Leslie Knope,"They also wanted to cut A.P. Latin, so I volunteered to teach Latin."
Leslie Knope,"Which reminds me, I need to learn Latin."
Leslie Knope,"I can't stop thinking about that job in Chicago, and I think this prom will be a good distraction."
Leslie Knope,"In my senior year when I couldn't decide between Indiana and Amherst, I focused all my energy on planning my prom, and it was the best prom ever."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I made out with Harvey from the A.V. Club."
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't be.
Leslie Knope,"A few weeks later, he almost died from a VCR electrocution."
Leslie Knope,Legend has it that he can still turn on a microwave just by blinking at it.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, will you go to the prom with me?"
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Prom!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are making progress, prom committee."
Leslie Knope,"Now, our budget is basically zero, so we're gonna need to cover all the jobs that we would normally hire people for."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge of music."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, did you want to DJ, little puppy?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that little puppies could operate an iPod with their little puppy paws.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, you can co-DJ with Tom."
Leslie Knope,"All right, Allison, you are in charge of choosing the prom theme, and now it has to be perfect and magical and look like a million bucks but cost zero bucks."
Leslie Knope,So what do you got?
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Are those jense-trodder color tabs?
Leslie Knope,I thought those were discontinued.
Leslie Knope,Juan Julio Oficina Supplies?
Leslie Knope,I thought they went out of business.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody get back to work."
Leslie Knope,"And, Allison, come by my office later so we can keep crushing it."
Leslie Knope,"So I want to show you some very cool before and after pictures of Cherryhurst Park, one of our greatest accomplishments."
Leslie Knope,Because I think you have a real knack for public service.
Leslie Knope,"We here at the parks department have something called ""The April Ludgate Summer Solstice Druid Festival and Buffalo Wings Eating Contest."""
Leslie Knope,I don't know why I let her name it.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, it's a summer internship program."
Leslie Knope,I think you'd be great.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to work here?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,You two know each other?
Leslie Knope,Is there some secret society for the greatest humans on earth?
Leslie Knope,Do you meet Tom Hanks and Elena Kagan in the Statue of Liberty's crown?
Leslie Knope,"God, this fake club I'm inventing is amazing."
Leslie Knope,That's what he calls city hall.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you shut your mustache?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Is it worth a few bucks to get a million splinters in your fingers and then cut off your fingers accidentally, 'cause that will happen."
Leslie Knope,I may be leaving this office soon.
Leslie Knope,I need to plant seeds for the next generation.
Leslie Knope,"Interns become fulltime staff, become department directors."
Leslie Knope,Circle of life.
Leslie Knope,The seasons turn.
Leslie Knope,It's really quite beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"And if Ron tries to stop me, he can eat a big ol' bowl of butts."
Leslie Knope,Aplus!
Leslie Knope,Can I get that in writing?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, did he?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't even notice.
Leslie Knope,No bigs.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, Allison, I have a question for you that's very important and very serious."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me closely.
Leslie Knope,Will you help me orchestrate the balloon drop?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hooray!"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'll just be over here having fun.
Leslie Knope,See you soon!
Leslie Knope,"I know what you're doing, Ron, and I will defeat you."
Leslie Knope,Mark my words.
Leslie Knope,So have you ever pulled a ceremonial cord before?
Leslie Knope,There's a little trick to it.
Leslie Knope,"You want to hold it not too tight, sort of like a firm handshake and then move towards the ground in a rope pulling motion."
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you don't have to thank me."
Leslie Knope,Working for the government is its own reward--
Leslie Knope,"Run, Allison, run."
Leslie Knope,Don't listen to him.
Leslie Knope,"Now, when you pull the rope, don't look at the balloons."
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces of the people as the balloons drop.
Leslie Knope,That's what government is about.
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces.
Leslie Knope,Pull the rope.
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces.
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces!
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You've ruined prom.
Leslie Knope,Everybody's having a terrible time.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, your telephone is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,"And second of all, I already beat it."
Leslie Knope,She's gonna take that internship.
Leslie Knope,She pulled the rope.
Leslie Knope,There's no turning back!
Leslie Knope,"I wouldn't say ""harassing"" so much as persistently tormenting."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Don't be disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,I've never had a principal or a teacher be disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that I'm equipped to handle it.
Leslie Knope,"I think the only thing that matters is whatever Apluses may or may not have been handed out, you know, are still in effect in perpetuity."
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Now it is time for the most magical moment of any high school prom: The announcement of the winner of the Parks and Recreation's coveted summer internship.
Leslie Knope,"Without further ado, help me congratulate Allison Gliffert!"
Leslie Knope,Can we get a little music here maybe?
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take this internship.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna fall in love with public service.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna rise through the ranks.
Leslie Knope,You'll take over Ron's job as parks director.
Leslie Knope,"You'll win a seat in congress, and then you and I will run against each other as president, but right before we find out who won, I'm gonna pat you on the back and say, ""It's your turn, kid."""
Leslie Knope,"And if this is the evening you decide to have sex, use protection, please!"
Leslie Knope,Smart.
Leslie Knope,Saves a lot of time.
Leslie Knope,They wrote all the team names in pink.
Leslie Knope,Nobody told them to do that.
Leslie Knope,"I'm thinking of leaving Pawnee, moving to Chicago."
Leslie Knope,I just need to make sure that the future is secure around here when I leave.
Leslie Knope,"You know? Allison would become April, and then April would become me."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, let's face it, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I love you, but you're hopeless without me."
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I just wish once you would say something stupid so I could ignore it.
Leslie Knope,"Allison, we wanted to apologize for acting so bananas."
Leslie Knope,"You just have so much promise, we got excited."
Leslie Knope,You're a good kid.
Leslie Knope,"And whatever you choose, you'll be great at it."
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, Ron, she is so thoughtful and grounded."
Leslie Knope,"Get her away from me, or I'm gonna kidnap her and try to mentor her to death."
Leslie Knope,Greg Pikitis.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Gregory."
Leslie Knope,You might say that.
Leslie Knope,Offer is off the table.
Leslie Knope,She's a terrible person with terrible judgment.
Leslie Knope,Pikitis!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Are you getting sick?
Leslie Knope,"It's flu season again, and I cannot get sick."
Leslie Knope,Stock up on Kleenex.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch your face.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch anything.
Leslie Knope,People are dropping like flies.
Leslie Knope,We already had to quarantine Larry.
Leslie Knope,"The tent is your home now, Larry."
Leslie Knope,We already forwarded your mail.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Nice!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no, I don't want to touch your hand."
Leslie Knope,Chipp McCapp is the most amazing 17 year old country singer in the entire world.
Leslie Knope,He's like Indiana's sweetheart.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"His latest song, Beautiful Like My Mom parentheses Support the Troops has, like, two million hits on YouTube."
Leslie Knope,Play it again.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, those are long shots."
Leslie Knope,"""Bob Dylan's friends?"""
Leslie Knope,Land Ho.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love them."
Leslie Knope,Everybody does.
Leslie Knope,But there's no way they're getting back together.
Leslie Knope,Their lead singer split 10 years ago.
Leslie Knope,He titled their last album We'll Never Reunite.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Back in your tent, sicky."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need all hands on deck."
Leslie Knope,There are no hands to be on deck because everybody's at the winery.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, you and I need to handle this."
Leslie Knope,We need to be operating at maximum
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Larry!"
Leslie Knope,"All we need to do is go to Indianapolis, convince Chipp to do the festival and then, you know, head home."
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,"I've had the flu before, and I worked through it."
Leslie Knope,That's not first aid.
Leslie Knope,You can buy two candies.
Leslie Knope,I have the flu.
Leslie Knope,"Supernauseated for a few days, a lot of barfing."
Leslie Knope,It's a total disaster.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I have a ton of work to do, so I need the good stuff."
Leslie Knope,The Mariah needs to sing tonight stuff.
Leslie Knope,It's the flu.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't think it could be anythingâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I just need a minute."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to call Ben about nothing.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,It's your me.
Leslie Knope,It's wife.
Leslie Knope,I have very big news for you.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Are you having a stroke?
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"We're sorry to interrupt, Chipp."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,We just wanted to say we are such big fans.
Leslie Knope,It's an honor to meet you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,He's a monster.
Leslie Knope,But we need him.
Leslie Knope,We know that you have that important other engagement--
Leslie Knope,It's not just Pawnee that needs you.
Leslie Knope,It's the entire region.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is a good town.
Leslie Knope,With good people from all walks of life.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it is an amazing place to raise kids and start a family."
Leslie Knope,You're crazy.
Leslie Knope,This is over.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee does not need you.
Leslie Knope,"And you should know that, when you shook my hand earlier, there was pee on my palms."
Leslie Knope,That makes us sound like hicks.
Leslie Knope,We're not.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,Stupid.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, Andy."
Leslie Knope,It was not awesome.
Leslie Knope,"I lost our headliner, I can't stop throwing up, and Ben has not called me back yet."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm so frazzled.
Leslie Knope,There's just a lot of things going on right now.
Leslie Knope,Personal things that I can't talk to you about.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, thank you."
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what I needed to hear right now.
Leslie Knope,"God, it's so weird that you know that I'm pregnant before Ben does."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,What did you think?
Leslie Knope,Why did you go like this?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I think we need to focus on the fact that we have lost our headliner."
Leslie Knope,We are out of options.
Leslie Knope,It's time for a Hail Mary.
Leslie Knope,How are we going to convince this guy to reunite Land Ho?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, that is not a good strategy, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I will give him a brief explanation about the Unity Concert.
Leslie Knope,And you stand by.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I understand."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Um, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,My stomach is trying to murder me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I have so much to tell you."
Leslie Knope,We got Land Ho to play the Unity Concert.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, what happened to you?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, buddy, I've got some good news for you."
Leslie Knope,"That's great, April."
Leslie Knope,How'd you do that?
Leslie Knope,"It's a long story, but the short version is, I'm currently catfishing Anthony Kiedis."
Leslie Knope,"We're throwing a charity auction to raise money for the unity concert, and we're gonna need it too, if I'm gonna perform Islands In the Stream with a Sacagawea hologram."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we need lights, generators, microphones, water, that boring stuff too."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"All right, yep."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, keep working."
Leslie Knope,We'll be back.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are going to have a doctor's appointment, and then after that, we can probably tell people."
Leslie Knope,"So just hang in there, please."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We need to raise a minimum of $30,000 from the auction, or else the concert's gonna be in trouble."
Leslie Knope,What else can we auction off?
Leslie Knope,What about those fish?
Leslie Knope,Think they're valuable?
Leslie Knope,Cover me.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, I cannot slow down."
Leslie Knope,The concert is in three weeks.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I feel fine, and if you're worried, we can just ask Dr. Saperstein what he thinks."
Leslie Knope,He's a little weird.
Leslie Knope,"Now, Ben wants me to slow down, but I have this huge project coming up, and slowing down isn't really my jam."
Leslie Knope,I win.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,Twins.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're having twins."
Leslie Knope,Triplets?
Leslie Knope,Triplets?
Leslie Knope,Triplets.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it.
Leslie Knope,We knocked it out of the park on the first try.
Leslie Knope,"If we do this right, we can be parents to 1/3 of the supreme court!"
Leslie Knope,This is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"I always knew we were one in a million, and now we got the proof!"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Are you ready to go, my gentle dove?"
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming to this wonderful and calm event.
Leslie Knope,Our first item up for bid is two allaccess V.I.P. passes to the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Let's start the bidding at 40 dollars.
Leslie Knope,Do I hear 40?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,40
Leslie Knope,We can beat this.
Leslie Knope,50
Leslie Knope,Anyone for 50?
Leslie Knope,50 dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, sir."
Leslie Knope,Terrific.
Leslie Knope,Any higher?
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's fine."
Leslie Knope,We're all just calm and happy people enjoying ourselves together on earth.
Leslie Knope,Sold for 50 dollars.
Leslie Knope,How magnificent.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm doing really fine."
Leslie Knope,"Our next item up for bid is the naming rights for our children's tent, so let's start the bidding at 1,000 dollars, please."
Leslie Knope,"Anyone want to-- Oh, thank you, madam."
Leslie Knope,A very wealthy and elegant looking woman with a diamond encrusted eye patch just raised her hand.
Leslie Knope,Don't look at her.
Leslie Knope,"She doesn't like attention, but she's there."
Leslie Knope,She's real.
Leslie Knope,"So do I hear 2,000?"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, yeah, here we go."
Leslie Knope,The sheik has thrown his hat into the ring.
Leslie Knope,Well..
Leslie Knope,It looks like we've got a real bidding war between
Leslie Knope,An elegant
Leslie Knope,"3,000, says the gentleman"
Leslie Knope,With the crazy hat and a monkey on his shoulder.
Leslie Knope,That is outrageous.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Pearl, jump in."
Leslie Knope,Don't make me pull the permits on your rental units.
Leslie Knope,Ben!
Leslie Knope,Poor Ben.
Leslie Knope,"You know the EMT said that if flea had sent you his bass, you could've lost a thumb."
Leslie Knope,"No, we do not have time."
Leslie Knope,We have a concert to save.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, he's feeling better."
Leslie Knope,"He can go, right, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I wonder if I'll ever stop doing that.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there's still plenty of ways to raise money for the concert, right?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe we'll win the lottery.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, hey, you're looking at a woman who just hit triple cherries in her uterus."
Leslie Knope,"No, we're not, we have three weeks until the concert."
Leslie Knope,It'll be fine.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, our kids will be geniuses."
Leslie Knope,They'll get scholarships.
Leslie Knope,Half of my tuition was paid for by the Indiana scholarship for pretty blondes who like to read.
Leslie Knope,It's now called the Virginia Woolf prize-- different time.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, honey--"
Leslie Knope,"Honey, can you just breathe for a second?"
Leslie Knope,Breathe.
Leslie Knope,Benjamin Wyatt
Leslie Knope,"The man of my dreams, the one that I love, shh."
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,"You just look so crazy right now, but cute."
Leslie Knope,Because I realized something.
Leslie Knope,"Everything that we have been through-- the harvest festival, the election, the recall, the merger, Ann leaving, Larry changing his name for some stupid reason-- all of it has just been preparation for this."
Leslie Knope,I am immune to stress because I have you.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, if you could gather aroundâ¦"
Leslie Knope,The reason I have been acting so weird is not because I've been waiting for the results of the soil samples to come back.
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter, Larry."
Leslie Knope,It was a pointless ruse designed to waste time.
Leslie Knope,The truth is I'm pregnant.
Leslie Knope,"We're having triplets, andâ¦"
Leslie Knope,We're having triplets.
Leslie Knope,That's nice of him.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Today we are welcoming a delegation from the Parks Department of our sister city, Boraqua, Venezuela."
Leslie Knope,Our photo-op with the mayor is tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna need your suggestions about my wardrobe ASAP."
Leslie Knope,"Also, remember, everyone, Venezuela is a poor country."
Leslie Knope,These men are not used to the wealth and flash that we have here in central Indiana.
Leslie Knope,Our only job over the next two days is to make these men feel at home.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am a little nervous."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has kind of a tricky history with welcoming foreign visitors.
Leslie Knope,But things have changed.
Leslie Knope,"Our guests are gonna stay in a motel, for sure."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,What if they don't speak English?
Leslie Knope,"April, you know Spanish, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Here they are.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, clean up."
Leslie Knope,Pull your thing up.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, just be Good."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, hit it."
Leslie Knope,This is my baby.
Leslie Knope,"I've put this whole trip together, and let me tell you something."
Leslie Knope,"It's not been easy, you know?"
Leslie Knope,How do you fit all of Pawnee in a 48 hour visit?
Leslie Knope,I had to drop the Rock and Roll bowling alley from our itinerary.
Leslie Knope,That was one of the most difficult phone calls I've ever had to make.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, most excellent representatives of the great Parks Department of Boraqua, Venezuela."
Leslie Knope,"I am Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and Chairwoman of the Departmental Ad Hoc Subcommittee for Pit Beautification, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,And he is?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, please."
Leslie Knope,"It's a different culture, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just be a good host.
Leslie Knope,Do this for me?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,We will get our pathetic servant boy to fetch your luggage.
Leslie Knope,"Go, boy!"
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know you gentlemen had a long flight, but I have prepared a welcome party in your honor."
Leslie Knope,"Well, my job is to see to your every need."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I think there might've been a translation problem.
Leslie Knope,"When I said party, I meant one that did not include sex for pay."
Leslie Knope,"But one that had food and drink and dancing, that sort of thing."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Off to kind of a weird start.
Leslie Knope,We have so much to learn from each other.
Leslie Knope,What kind of birds do you guys eat?
Leslie Knope,"Us, too!"
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Water, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Agua.
Leslie Knope,I can assure you that that water's very safe to drink.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, go get water."
Leslie Knope,This gun truly symbolizes the blossoming peace between our two nations.
Leslie Knope,A key aspect to diplomacy is gift giving.
Leslie Knope,"The gift has to be nice enough to honor and respect the guest, but not so nice that it shames him."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it needs to represent the local culture."
Leslie Knope,And I found the perfect thing.
Leslie Knope,"A bottle of high fructose corn syrup, made right here in Pawnee's own Sweetums factory."
Leslie Knope,Sweetums!
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, Sweetums!"
Leslie Knope,Since 1891.
Leslie Knope,"And eight and a half dozen rubber baby bottle nipples, also made here in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Kernston's Rubber Nipples, tastes like the real thing."
Leslie Knope,"His English isn't perfect, so I don't think he realizes how insulting he's being."
Leslie Knope,"That's fine, it's my job."
Leslie Knope,I'm a diplomat.
Leslie Knope,I'm not supposed to take it personally.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, that's why people respect Hillary Clinton so much."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause, nobody takes a punch like her."
Leslie Knope,"She's the strongest, smartest punching bag in the world."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Let's get started, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,I have a full day of activities planned.
Leslie Knope,A restaurant?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,This is our thermometer!
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit into a community park.
Leslie Knope,"But I need 35,000 dollars, and the city doesn't have enough money in its budget."
Leslie Knope,You've never had a budget shortage?
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, well."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I do not understand."
Leslie Knope,The Venezuelans are a very confident people.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, I know these guys didn't turn out to be exactly how we thought they would be."
Leslie Knope,I'm calling an audible.
Leslie Knope,We can't be humble anymore.
Leslie Knope,"What we're gonna do is, we're gonna take them to our best park and we're gonna blow their socks off."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, we'll go further."
Leslie Knope,We'll take them to Chicago and pretend it's part of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Or New York.
Leslie Knope,Or London!
Leslie Knope,"No, wait, the money's different there."
Leslie Knope,They'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, never mind."
Leslie Knope,We'll go to the park.
Leslie Knope,Everybody doing okay back there?
Leslie Knope,Comfortable?
Leslie Knope,"Well, the motel we're putting you up in is really nice."
Leslie Knope,You can watch TBS.
Leslie Knope,Do you have TBS in Venezuela?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I'm coming over to your house then.
Leslie Knope,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,"Take it in, boys."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?
Leslie Knope,Correct what?
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,This is already a park.
Leslie Knope,And it's one of our best loved parks.
Leslie Knope,They're not that small.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, size doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't have Lady Gaga."
Leslie Knope,And I don't think she's going to come here unless her career takes a very bad turn.
Leslie Knope,But we have something more beautiful than Lady Gaga.
Leslie Knope,Democracy.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna show you an example of that.
Leslie Knope,Let's go to a town hall meeting.
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready?"
Leslie Knope,We're about to start.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the location rotates."
Leslie Knope,Sometimes we have them on the volleyball courts.
Leslie Knope,Where do you hold your meetings?
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,We don't need palaces.
Leslie Knope,The ideas are what shine in our meetings.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was tough going, but it was lively."
Leslie Knope,What did you think of the open forum?
Leslie Knope,That's one perspective.
Leslie Knope,"In a true Democracy, we believe that the input of our citizens is extremely valuable."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Nothing gets done?
Leslie Knope,Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Leslie Knope,Or American Idol.
Leslie Knope,Or the moon!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, you can't, 'cause you've never been there."
Leslie Knope,I think you're rude.
Leslie Knope,And I think you've been rude since you came here.
Leslie Knope,"And I think that your medals are stupid and your uniform is lame, and you guys want to marry Hugo Chavez!"
Leslie Knope,Stupid Chavez.
Leslie Knope,"Good, I just did."
Leslie Knope,I don't like Chavez.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't, Raul."
Leslie Knope,"Look, if you don't like it here, then go, okay, Raul?"
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,Those are our pens.
Leslie Knope,"Great, then don't take them."
Leslie Knope,They started it.
Leslie Knope,"Look, those guys were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I may have lost my cool, but they deserved it."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Don't do that!
Leslie Knope,"No, they were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks!"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to!
Leslie Knope,Yesterday I was tough and direct and today I have to be charming.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, yesterday I was Hillary Clinton, and today I'm Bill."
Leslie Knope,I'd love some coffee.
Leslie Knope,I'll have some nuts.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'll take those.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Raul, gentlemen, thank you for coming."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would just like to first say, I am so sorry for blowing up yesterday."
Leslie Knope,It was completely uncalled for.
Leslie Knope,"35,000 dollars?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, we can't take this."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should return the money.
Leslie Knope,"It's from a foreign government, I don't really trust these guys."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna return the money.
Leslie Knope,Let's look at the pros and cons.
Leslie Knope,"Con, we might be filling it in with dirty money."
Leslie Knope,"Con, not quite sure why that's a pro."
Leslie Knope,"Con, Ann already said that."
Leslie Knope,Pro and con never works!
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,We'll keep the money.
Leslie Knope,"Okay? Everybody happy? Jerry, are you happy?"
Leslie Knope,"Meeting adjourned, Jerry!"
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, I still feel kind of weird about this money."
Leslie Knope,Raul.
Leslie Knope,The mayor will be with us in just a few minutes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sure."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yes, I do."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is a check for 35,000 dollars and it is to build a park."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's really generous."
Leslie Knope,Viva Venezuela!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Venezuela!"
Leslie Knope,"Aw, come on."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to ""viva"" that guy."
Leslie Knope,Viva Chavez.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,What is he saying?
Leslie Knope,Committee?
Leslie Knope,The Committee to Humiliate and Shame America?
Leslie Knope,Viva America! Viva Pawnee! Viva Mayor Walter Gunderson!
Leslie Knope,"No, America is not perfect."
Leslie Knope,But diplomacy isn't just sucking up and being a pushover.
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you got to get tough.
Leslie Knope,"I am gonna build that park myself, and it is gonna be awesome."
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna have a fountain shaped like Hugo Chavez's head spitting water all over everyone.
Leslie Knope,Unless that's what the people want.
Leslie Knope,"And that, sir, is democracy."
Leslie Knope,Holy cow!
Leslie Knope,This may be the craziest week of my entire life.
Leslie Knope,I am six days away from the start of the Unity concert.
Leslie Knope,I am pregnant with triplets.
Leslie Knope,"I am trying to decide if I should take a job that will move me away from Pawnee, and I am speaking at the National Parks conference in San Francisco."
Leslie Knope,It is gonna be so much fun.
Leslie Knope,"Michelle Obama is the keynote speaker, and you know what they say, ""What happens at a national parks conference... Is compiled and emailed to you in a PDF the following Monday."""
Leslie Knope,"""Lester Kanopf""?"
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, get it together."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, Lester."
Leslie Knope,"Grant, hi."
Leslie Knope,I I wouldâ¦
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville-- the department of the interior's resident bad boy?
Leslie Knope,"Well, now you've got my attention."
Leslie Knope,"Let me go grab my autograph book, and we'll head out."
Leslie Knope,"Varuvian, yes, hello."
Leslie Knope,I know who you are.
Leslie Knope,I've read all of your papers and I had your poster on my wall when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,I made a poster of you by blowing up your picture from the national parks newsletter.
Leslie Knope,I cut out your face and made it look like you were dunking over Charles Barkley.
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville read my proposal.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Rebecca Varuvian.
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,That was the best lunch I ever had.
Leslie Knope,I have to see the photos that you took.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Grant, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's fair."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I would be insane not to take the job, but I'm just having some trouble thinking about leaving Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, you are from Chicago, so you like it!"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I do agree with you."
Leslie Knope,"I agree with you on all things throughout history until the end of time, forever."
Leslie Knope,You and Grant work together?
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"That's really, really incredible!"
Leslie Knope,Great work!
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
Leslie Knope,"I'm getting louder now, and I can't stop!"
Leslie Knope,My apologies!
Leslie Knope,Just-- I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
Leslie Knope,Just can I high-five you?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Andy, I'm very nervous about this."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna hurt yourself.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Anyway I've decided.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna take the job.
Leslie Knope,"There's so much more in the world to see, and I feel like I can really make a difference."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and I met Michelle Obama."
Leslie Knope,I don't know!
Leslie Knope,Liam Boneville has me in a tizzy.
Leslie Knope,By using the Leslie Knope seamless merger supersystem-- patent pending-- Pawnee and Eagleton and their parks departments will be fully integrated within the next 6 to 12 months.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,I think it was a good presentation too.
Leslie Knope,Is that why you're laughing?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How is that possible?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"I've been accused of lot of things, but cavalier has never been one of them."
Leslie Knope,I have a super system.
Leslie Knope,You lost your cityhood?
Leslie Knope,Don't say it.
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,I can't leave Pawnee during a difficult merger that I'm responsible for.
Leslie Knope,I have to turn down the job.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but I've been doing this for months."
Leslie Knope,The only thing that I am 100% positive on is that I want to stay and go.
Leslie Knope,I'm never gonna be able to decide.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna be paralyzed by hypotheticals until I die here, in this minivan at the San Francisco airport."
Leslie Knope,Where are we going?
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a gorgeous view."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a compelling point."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Grant."
Leslie Knope,I want the job.
Leslie Knope,"I have a lot of questions, but I'm a little amped up right now, so I'll probably just hang up."
Leslie Knope,It might be for the best.
Leslie Knope,"But, anyway, I love you."
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,That was weird.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is Lester Kanopf."
Leslie Knope,"No, you know who it--"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,I panicked.
Leslie Knope,We should go.
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of stuff to do and the meter's still running on that cab, so chop chop."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you are in charge."
Leslie Knope,This is your show.
Leslie Knope,Take it away.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,The name is too long.
Leslie Knope,I was picturing bigger hats.
Leslie Knope,Can the Parks and Rec people hang back for a second?
Leslie Knope,"Um The reason I wanted you guys to stick around is, I wanted to tell youâ¦"
Leslie Knope,That I love and admire you.
Leslie Knope,"A while ago, I was offered a job at the national parks service, and it's a great opportunity, but it means that I'll have to move to Illinois."
Leslie Knope,And I took the job.
Leslie Knope,"Leslie Knope, champion of the Pawnee Eagleton merger, ""our most faithful citizen."""
Leslie Knope,"""She never abandoned us."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"""'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.' Leslie Knope, multiple occasions."""
Leslie Knope,"This is so touching, you guys."
Leslie Knope,I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Leslie Knope,"Crazy, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so does that mean that there's two openings left?"
Leslie Knope,Because I happen to know some of the most dedicated civil servants and greatest people to ever walk the planet earth.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have to ask you something, and I want you to consider it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Really consider it.
Leslie Knope,How would you feel about leaving Pawnee and moving to Chicago?
Leslie Knope,"Hold on, come on, I'm not done."
Leslie Knope,You'd be working for the federal government.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, excuse me for wanting my dear friend and ethical mentor to accompany me on the adventure of a lifetime."
Leslie Knope,"I hope you like deep dish pizza, because there's gonna be a lot more of it in Chicago, where we're all gonna be moving."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, take a risk."
Leslie Knope,Live on the edge.
Leslie Knope,Life is an adventure.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you owe me for that pizza."
Leslie Knope,Everybody turned me down but Larry.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here."
Leslie Knope,"And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?"
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,That's very sweet.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I can have everything I want!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and by the way, don't think that we are not discussing Duke silver."
Leslie Knope,When were you going to tell me about that? Unbelievable!
Leslie Knope,"I am so furious at you, but I've already forgiven you, and you need to teach me how to play the saxophone."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,No time for small talk.
Leslie Knope,I think the best version of me working as Midwest regional director is not in Chicago.
Leslie Knope,It's right here in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Pawnee is a town on the rise, and national parks could get in on the ground floor."
Leslie Knope,"It's the best option, hands down."
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to make the hardest climb to see the most beautiful sunrise.
Leslie Knope,I read that once on an old lady's decorative pillow.
Leslie Knope,But it is really how I feel today.
Leslie Knope,"I've climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I'm starving, but the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility."
Leslie Knope,So I'm just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.
Leslie Knope,"Call Ken and Rebecca, and no statements to the press unless I personally release them."
Leslie Knope,We are on a media lockdown.
Leslie Knope,Where is Ed with the file? Ed!
Leslie Knope,"Ed, you're a nice guy, but you're the most incompetent person I've ever word with, and that includes Terry."
Leslie Knope,Clean out your desk.
Leslie Knope,You're fired.
Leslie Knope,Cancel my flight to South Dakota.
Leslie Knope,We'll do it next month.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, what's our play here?"
Leslie Knope,"But honey, tonight's your big night."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys! Mommy and daddy had to do a little work, and you're gonna have a fun play date with Uncle Andy and Aunty April, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"One day, in the distant future, things will be calm and normal, right?"
Leslie Knope,Not at all.
Leslie Knope,But that's never stopped us before.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there were rumors that they were gonna announce it next month."
Leslie Knope,But they must've gotten impatient.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Whatever they say, we need to come up with 10,000 possible responses to 10,000 possible scenarios."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,How are those scenarios coming?
Leslie Knope,Who's here?
Leslie Knope,I'm perfectly civil.
Leslie Knope,He's the stupid garbage head doodoo face.
Leslie Knope,"This land is begging to be a new national park, and it's in my own backyard!"
Leslie Knope,This could be my crowning achievement.
Leslie Knope,I could retire.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wouldn't."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna work until I'm 100 and then cut back to four days a week.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I'm already so bored thinking about that one day off.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll go to law school or something.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Cool.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,He's here?
Leslie Knope,I don't want to talk to him.
Leslie Knope,I should hide.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He should hide.
Leslie Knope,He should run.
Leslie Knope,He should run away.
Leslie Knope,He should hide his stupid face.
Leslie Knope,He shouldn't be--
Leslie Knope,"Hello, former strange person I used to friend."
Leslie Knope,You're looking very Ron like.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,I have bangs now!
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe you should!"
Leslie Knope,You know that the National Park System deserves this land.
Leslie Knope,Why are you trying to screw me?
Leslie Knope,This is like Morningstar all over again!
Leslie Knope,"Well, you don't know who you're dealing with."
Leslie Knope,"I directly oversee 1,200 people."
Leslie Knope,I have a staff of creative geniuses that will not stop working until we win this bid!
Leslie Knope,"Get out of here, Ed!"
Leslie Knope,I fired you.
Leslie Knope,He's very stupid.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, hi!"
Leslie Knope,I'm glad I caught you before you left.
Leslie Knope,"Just between you and me, what do you think your land might sell for tomorrow?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow!"
Leslie Knope,Would you ever consider giving the federal government a discount?
Leslie Knope,For a very good cause?
Leslie Knope,A National Park?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no, you haven't though."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's a tough one.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you, Jessica."
Leslie Knope,You did and said exactly what I thought you were gonna do and say.
Leslie Knope,And that's oddly comforting.
Leslie Knope,Get on the phone to Washington.
Leslie Knope,Call in every favor that we have.
Leslie Knope,"Dave, put Missouri on the back burner, this is top priority."
Leslie Knope,"You all have 36 hours to find me 90 million dollars, go!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I only have 2 million dollars in the discretionary fund, and I've already used some of it to make Thomas Jefferson sexier in those Mount Rushmore promotions."
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, attendance has been up."
Leslie Knope,That's not a coincidence.
Leslie Knope,That is a very smart idea.
Leslie Knope,And that tuxedo makes you look like a sexy orchestra conductor.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Wave this pen around.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Let's go get that park.
Leslie Knope,That park is my dream.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let it slip away.
Leslie Knope,Who cares if Gryzzl and Ron have more money?
Leslie Knope,"I have the most valuable currency in America, a blind, stubborn belief that what I am doing is 100% right."
Leslie Knope,Ken Hotate!
Leslie Knope,Great bolo tie.
Leslie Knope,Is that new?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, now that we're chatting, the National Park Service is looking to buy the Newport Land, but we're a little short on funds."
Leslie Knope,88 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,What do you say you put some of that casino money to good use?
Leslie Knope,"No, it would be a donation."
Leslie Knope,The government would keep the land.
Leslie Knope,"Well, when you put it like that, I see the irony."
Leslie Knope,"So, are you in?"
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,What if I buy some of your disappointing son's bolo ties?
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know all of you are off doing your own things, and we don't see each other as much as we used to, but I need my old team back for one last mission."
Leslie Knope,"So, hands in, ""Defeat Ron"" on three!"
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom's dead to me."
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,I'm waiting for your hand.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're getting married?
Leslie Knope,That's amazing!
Leslie Knope,And you didn't tell me earlier.
Leslie Knope,How could you?
Leslie Knope,"It's very beautiful, and I'm furious at you."
Leslie Knope,They're great.
Leslie Knope,"You know, they're trying to destroy us."
Leslie Knope,"There's three of them, it's insane, but they're great."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how could you?"
Leslie Knope,"First you try to steal my park, and now you steal my team?"
Leslie Knope,"Why don't you shove them all in your dumb mouth and then when I turn around, you can stab me in the back with the skewer?"
Leslie Knope,Why are you even here?
Leslie Knope,What have you ever done for this city?
Leslie Knope,I told you to never say that word to me!
Leslie Knope,No one should ever say that word out loud.
Leslie Knope,"It's like ""Voldemort"" or ""Ron."""
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,You don't deserve that candle!
Leslie Knope,Give me that candle!
Leslie Knope,This candle's mine!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Gimme this candle.
Leslie Knope,"You steal my team, I steal your candle!"
Leslie Knope,I want it!
Leslie Knope,Stop!
Leslie Knope,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Leslie Knope,Just wheel out the backup cake.
Leslie Knope,Who doesn't bake a backup cake?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I just want you to know that I am not sorry that I pushed you into a giant cake.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, Mr. Nelson, you are going to hear a lot of bids today."
Leslie Knope,But this is the only one that matters.
Leslie Knope,It's a zero.
Leslie Knope,I bid zero dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is celebrating its 200th anniversary, and the Newport family has been here since day one."
Leslie Knope,"Through feast and famine, transformation, upheaval, celebration."
Leslie Knope,The Newport family is part of the fabric of this town.
Leslie Knope,"And not always in a good way, like when your hot fudge pipeline exploded."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, admittedly, it did make the fish taste delicious, but it was a PR nightmare."
Leslie Knope,My question is this.
Leslie Knope,What do you want the Newport name to mean in the future?
Leslie Knope,"If you donate this land, and you let me turn it into a national park, the Newport National Park, your name will stand for something good for generations to come."
Leslie Knope,Just keep me in the running.
Leslie Knope,Give me a chance to prove to you how great this could be.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm in the game.
Leslie Knope,All I have to do is convince them that it's better taking no money than taking 90 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,I started my career in Pawnee by turning a pit into a cool little park.
Leslie Knope,"And now I have the chance to give this town a massive, beautiful gift that they can use forever."
Leslie Knope,"In the words of Jason Bourne, ""This is where it started for me."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is where it ends."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I think he nailed it.
Leslie Knope,Attention! This is war.
Leslie Knope,You guys are going down.
Leslie Knope,And that's all I wanted to say.
Leslie Knope,"Except Donna, Tom, hey."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry I haven't kept in better touch with you recently, but, you know, I've been a little preoccupied with my kids and my job."
Leslie Knope,"So, it's really good to see you both."
Leslie Knope,"And also, prepare for war because you chose the wrong side and we are gonna smoke you."
Leslie Knope,"And also I made cookies, but Ron is not allowed to eat them and they say, ""Prepare for War"" on them, but the O in the word ""for"" is a heart."
Leslie Knope,Hey! Andy! Let's go.
Leslie Knope,War!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,I truly thought that I would never have to interact with you again.
Leslie Knope,The city council is voting on whether to rezone the Newport land for commercial use.
Leslie Knope,"If I win, stupid Gryzzl and stupid Ron can't build anything there, and then I'm sitting pretty."
Leslie Knope,"Sadly, the deciding vote is from my old city council mate, and human equivalent of gas station sushi, Jeremy Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"So, I am here to talk to you about why you should vote ""No"" in the zoning issue."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Who's your girlfriend?
Leslie Knope,Tammy.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Jamm and Tammy!
Leslie Knope,"""Jammy."""
Leslie Knope,You guys are so cute.
Leslie Knope,"When did you-- Why would either one of you, you know-- Why?"
Leslie Knope,"Dear God, why?"
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.
Leslie Knope,This is great news.
Leslie Knope,Because Ron is my opponent in this.
Leslie Knope,And you live to torture Ron.
Leslie Knope,Vote for me so that you can screw Ron over.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'm aligning myself with terrible people, but think of all the wonderful people who will benefit from a national park."
Leslie Knope,It's worth it.
Leslie Knope,"And you can trust my opinion because I have a lot to gain by being right, and I have severe tunnel vision about achieving my goals."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"In my experience with butt faces, you are one."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I didn't even get a chance to say my plan.
Leslie Knope,Please don't say Hitler.
Leslie Knope,What the hell just happened?
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,What did you do?
Leslie Knope,"No, you got all sneaky and snuck around and snooked that vote away from me."
Leslie Knope,And I know this because earlier I sneaked and snooked around and Jammy was supposed to vote for me!
Leslie Knope,The snooker has become the snorked!
Leslie Knope,You guys were supposed to vote for me.
Leslie Knope,So you thought if you voted for Ron you could actually win him back?
Leslie Knope,The vote is tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"If I don't get Jamm out from Tammy's clutches, I'm doomed."
Leslie Knope,It's like rescuing a bunny from a lion.
Leslie Knope,But that lion is a demonic sociopath with really nice cleavage.
Leslie Knope,So this is where you wanna eat lunch?
Leslie Knope,In a steakhouse?
Leslie Knope,Don't you have irritable bowel syndrome?
Leslie Knope,"God, I hate that I know that."
Leslie Knope,I don't think this relationship is that healthy.
Leslie Knope,I mean it seems like Tammy is trying to turn you into Ron.
Leslie Knope,And you're Jeremy Jamm!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, come on."
Leslie Knope,You love Porsches and spiked iced tea.
Leslie Knope,And you have a Hooters platinum card.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Well--
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,This is worse than I thought.
Leslie Knope,You're broken.
Leslie Knope,She has broken you.
Leslie Knope,You need to get away from her.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I'm calling a temporary truce.
Leslie Knope,You need to help me break up Jamm and Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"No, it is not about that."
Leslie Knope,It's not about the vote.
Leslie Knope,There is a guy in real trouble and you might be the only one who can help him.
Leslie Knope,This is about saving someone's soul.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, have you ever seen Monsters, Inc.?"
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,Engage in the culture once in a while!
Leslie Knope,Jamm!
Leslie Knope,Get in here!
Leslie Knope,Tammy happened to him!
Leslie Knope,"Remind you of anyone, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,We need to put our issues aside and defend this miserable person!
Leslie Knope,You keep that in your desk?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,We're also gonna try a Pavlovian technique.
Leslie Knope,"Ron is holding Tammy's perfume, Girth."
Leslie Knope,Again.
Leslie Knope,Until the bottle is empty.
Leslie Knope,Again.
Leslie Knope,Twice.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna do some scenes and demonstrate ways that you can resist Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"I will play Tammy, Ron will play you."
Leslie Knope,"Hey there, horsey."
Leslie Knope,Time to mount up and ride on into Bonertown.
Leslie Knope,"What do you say we get stanky in that pet store bathroom, Jamm?"
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, ya big hunk of wiener meat."
Leslie Knope,"I've got forty hand towels, some energy bars, and a Chinese finger trap."
Leslie Knope,Let's get gross.
Leslie Knope,"""Jamm! Strip down, you sex maggot!"""
Leslie Knope,"We drilled you on this, Jamm! Baby talk, what do you do?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that wasn't terrible."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Nice try.
Leslie Knope,"Stay strong, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Do you see what's happening here?
Leslie Knope,"Without Jamm, the vote's two-two."
Leslie Knope,This was all for nothing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought it was very big of you to help him at all."
Leslie Knope,You didn't have to do that.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Back to work, to figure out how to destroy you."
Leslie Knope,"So, gentlemen, you have evidence that the Newport land should be preserved."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for anything to strengthen my case that the Newport land should become a park and not a corporate campus.
Leslie Knope,"Religious reasons, animal conservation, historical significance."
Leslie Knope,Anything.
Leslie Knope,"So, hold onto your straws, everybody, because Mama's going grasping."
Leslie Knope,Two hundred and three thousand and sixty?
Leslie Knope,Two hundred thousand years from now?
Leslie Knope,That doesn't seem like an immediate crisis.
Leslie Knope,How did you get in here?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I love it when you talk Point of Sale docs."
Leslie Knope,You know it turns me on.
Leslie Knope,But no.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,There's no way that I will be in the same room with Ron Swanson unless it is during a police lineup when I am pointing him out as the man who betrayed me.
Leslie Knope,"""That's him, officer!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Ronald Swanson."""
Leslie Knope,"""Thank you, Leslie, that's the fifth crime you've solved this month."""
Leslie Knope,"""I'm not supposed to do this, but let me give you a badge and a siren for your car."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben?"
Leslie Knope,It all works out.
Leslie Knope,"I'll sign the documents here, and then you can bring it to Ron and he can sign it there, and then you can tell Ron to rot in hell."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,And infinity plus one year.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, bring in the next person."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Bill, I remember you."
Leslie Knope,We claim William Henry Harrison as a hero because he was the first governor of the Indiana territories and then President of the United States.
Leslie Knope,"We're also a little ashamed of him because he didn't wear a coat at his inauguration, caught a bad cold and died 32 days later."
Leslie Knope,He's an embarrassing footnote.
Leslie Knope,But he's our embarrassing footnote.
Leslie Knope,"If a US President had a house on that land, it could qualify for historic landmark status, and we could really stick it to Ron's team."
Leslie Knope,"Which would be icing on the cake, not the reason why we're doing this."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Show me this incredible lodge.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Here we are, like, ""Here's the place where I buried the map that will show us the way to William Henry Harrison's awesome hunting cabin?"""
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love William Henry Harrison as much, if not slightly more than, the next guy, but this is garbage."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, literally."
Leslie Knope,There's a bag of old hamburgers over there.
Leslie Knope,"We're running out of time, and we need to beat Ron."
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to have to use this old pile of bricks."
Leslie Knope,I need to gather everything I can on William Henry Harrison.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Put that down.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, this is so great."
Leslie Knope,"During the election campaign of 1840, William Henry Harrison supporters rolled this ten foot tin and paper ball down country lanes all across America."
Leslie Knope,"And they would sing along with a jug band, and it was just so exciting."
Leslie Knope,People would come from miles just to see it.
Leslie Knope,"This is what we have to work with, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"We are up against a very flashy Internet company, and we should be aiming for quantity over quality."
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to throw a bunch of Harrison facts at them and a big pile of bricks and whatever else we can find."
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people!"
Leslie Knope,Quantity!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, let's keep it going."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab the reading glasses.
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab that walking stick.
Leslie Knope,Grab everything you can.
Leslie Knope,I'm officially dubbing this Operation Quantity.
Leslie Knope,What's Ron up to?
Leslie Knope,"No, you have to tell me because you legally bound yourself to me in marriage, sucker."
Leslie Knope,That little rat.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Two can play this game.
Leslie Knope,"Bill, Operation Quantity needs a face."
Leslie Knope,Does William Henry Harrison have any direct descendants in the area?
Leslie Knope,This is our guy!
Leslie Knope,American royalty!
Leslie Knope,His veins pulse with the blood of our storied forefathers!
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's American royalty."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,And we need him for the press conference.
Leslie Knope,And we need all of this stuff.
Leslie Knope,"So help me God, I will make a mountain out of this molehill."
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello, Zach."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am Leslie."
Leslie Knope,It is an honor to have you here.
Leslie Knope,You are Indiana's last living link to this great man.
Leslie Knope,Do you?
Leslie Knope,Could that be possible?
Leslie Knope,"Because, you know, I've always thought that we shared very similar jawlines."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's something to chew on.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, okay, doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,I need this to be very impressive.
Leslie Knope,"So, head on in there and be presidentially descended."
Leslie Knope,Just go in there.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Just walk, walk, walk there."
Leslie Knope,Quiet now.
Leslie Knope,Walk in.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,You can't do that.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ignore them.
Leslie Knope,We start in 10 minutes.
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is a place of culture, history, and heritage."
Leslie Knope,And the National Parks Service is proud to say that we've discovered a new chapter in the life of local hero and President William Henry Harrison.
Leslie Knope,A heretofore unknown hunting lodge was recently discovered smack dab in the middle of the Newport land.
Leslie Knope,What great historical moments took place within these hallowed halls?
Leslie Knope,Did Harrison plan his presidential campaign while sitting around the hearth which used to be there.
Leslie Knope,"Did he write letters to Thomas Jefferson on his rolltop desk, which, you know, I don't know, might have existed."
Leslie Knope,The point is William Henry Harrison would have wanted this land preserved as a national park.
Leslie Knope,Don't believe me?
Leslie Knope,Let's ask him.
Leslie Knope,"In the form of his direct descendant, Zachary."
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sit."
Leslie Knope,"Now, travel back in time with me to 1840, when William Henry Harrison, ""Old Tippecanoe,"" runs for President."
Leslie Knope,"And his campaign rolls this giant tin and paper ball from town to town, while Americans everywhere sing along."
Leslie Knope,"Hit it, gang!"
Leslie Knope,They're talking about this ball.
Leslie Knope,Martin Van Buren.
Leslie Knope,That's who.
Leslie Knope,That was sickening.
Leslie Knope,"All flash, and no substance."
Leslie Knope,"No, it was not! We had way more quantity than you."
Leslie Knope,I'm not signing anything he's signing.
Leslie Knope,You know what? I can't stand you.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand your stupid mustache and your stupid shirt and your stupid name.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,That's not even a word.
Leslie Knope,You are the unreasonable one!
Leslie Knope,You've been unreasonable way before Morningstar!
Leslie Knope,"You're the most unreasonable, stubborn person I have ever met, and I'm never gonna change my mind on that, no matter what anybody says!"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I ordered 60 veggie pizzas to Ron's office."
Leslie Knope,"So, that calmed me down a little."
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,But I get to sign first.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's just get this over with."
Leslie Knope,What? What's going on? What's going on?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this is insane, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let us out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, babe, Game of Thrones is on tonight!"
Leslie Knope,It's the series finale.
Leslie Knope,Khaleesi is marrying Jack Sparrow.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, that show has really gone off the rails."
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"That's right, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"For once in your life, do something right."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Terry!"
Leslie Knope,I don't think there is.
Leslie Knope,They installed these magnetic locks two years ago.
Leslie Knope,There's no way around them.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, there's security wire in there."
Leslie Knope,You'll slice your arm open.
Leslie Knope,There is another way.
Leslie Knope,"We'll just wait a few minutes, turn on this monitor, and then we'll tell Ben that we talked it out and made up."
Leslie Knope,"I'll just tell them that I apologized for, whatever, heroically caring too much."
Leslie Knope,"And you admitted that you were a stubborn butthead, and everything's fine now."
Leslie Knope,Because we want them to believe us and not laugh really hard at a ridiculous science fiction scenario.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'll tell them that, for the past three years, you've been a perfect gentleman and scholar, and I am an insane weirdo who, despite being the only reason we even had a friendship to begin with, decided to ruin it, out of the blue, for no good reason."
Leslie Knope,Hut!
Leslie Knope,I destroyed the monitor!
Leslie Knope,I did not consider that possibility!
Leslie Knope,Everything's different.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the furniture, the pictures Craig changed everything."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we are going to be here for 10 hours."
Leslie Knope,"We can either talk about our issues and work through our problems, or we can just sit here doing nothing."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron, why don't we just--"
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,I bet I can make you talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me!
Leslie Knope,Drip.
Leslie Knope,Drip.
Leslie Knope,"One word, and this is over."
Leslie Knope,"I think wood is stupid, and so does everybody else."
Leslie Knope,"You guys, Ron loves plastic."
Leslie Knope,"Last chance, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You want to talk?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Ah-hah!
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,"You know what this is, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"This is a mix I made for the summer Parks barbecue, 2007."
Leslie Knope,I asked everyone in the Parks Department to choose one song.
Leslie Knope,You chose Buddy by Willie Nelson.
Leslie Knope,A fact I remember because my mind is a steel trap of friendship nuggets.
Leslie Knope,But I am not going to play your choice.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna play Jerry's choice.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna sing along.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna maintain eye contact the whole time.
Leslie Knope,And guess what?
Leslie Knope,I don't know the words.
Leslie Knope,"Harry Truman was a guy America, Red China All the countries, other people Everyone is fun Joe Mantegna, lan McKellen I have to buy a new toaster This is awesome You're so stupid Jumping up and down Whoo!"
Leslie Knope,I got it on repeat.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Do you want to hear it again, or do you want to talk?"
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, next verse."
Leslie Knope,Freddy Krueger bought some pants Oprah has a turtle farm Peter Piper peepee poopy Daddy ate a squirrel
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,We were friends for 10 years.
Leslie Knope,We were friends.
Leslie Knope,And now we're not.
Leslie Knope,"And once again, it is up to me to save our friendship."
Leslie Knope,And I will do so using the most powerful tool known to man.
Leslie Knope,A well organized chart.
Leslie Knope,"Three years ago, I accept a job at National Parks."
Leslie Knope,"You and I see each other less, admittedly, due to my busy schedule and your utter lack of interest in maintaining adult friendships."
Leslie Knope,"Three months later, April comes to work for me."
Leslie Knope,We throw her a party.
Leslie Knope,"At her request, the party's theme is ""Zombie Teenage Biker Gang Pizza Jamboree."""
Leslie Knope,That is the last time you and I see each other for more than five minutes.
Leslie Knope,"Three months later, you come and visit me at my office on the third floor for the very first time."
Leslie Knope,"One week later, I return from a trip, and I find out you have quit the Parks Department and you have started your own building company without even bothering to tell me."
Leslie Knope,"""Oh, well,"" I think to myself, ""You know, it was only a matter of time."""
Leslie Knope,"And then, two months after that, Morningstar, the final twist of the knife."
Leslie Knope,"I hear about Morningstar, and I calmly saunter down to your office and attempt to have a rational discussion with you about it."
Leslie Knope,"What the hell, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,You're building your stupid building on the block next to Pawnee Commons?
Leslie Knope,The park that I built from scratch out of a pit?
Leslie Knope,"This building is gonna ruin the views, you jerk."
Leslie Knope,And you're gonna tear all the houses down?
Leslie Knope,"Ann lived there, Ron."
Leslie Knope,That's Ann's old house.
Leslie Knope,That's my best friend's old house.
Leslie Knope,That was the house where I put on my wedding dress the night I got married.
Leslie Knope,That is the house where April and Andy met for the first time.
Leslie Knope,That is the house where Ann gave me my first ever smoky eye look.
Leslie Knope,That's not the point.
Leslie Knope,This building is a monstrosity.
Leslie Knope,And what's it called?
Leslie Knope,"""Morningstar?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Oh, dear."""
Leslie Knope,"""We live at the Morningstar."""
Leslie Knope,"""That's so posh and hibbley fibbley gibbley."""
Leslie Knope,That's not the point.
Leslie Knope,"You knew that I would be furious, and you didn't have the guts to tell me yourself."
Leslie Knope,"Enjoy your new job, Judas."
Leslie Knope,You tear down Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,"You spend the next two years cutting down trees and fighting zoning laws that I helped pass, basically spitting on everything we did together at Parks."
Leslie Knope,What does that mean?
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Why then?
Leslie Knope,What was the reason?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, you made a key?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please, don't--"
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just talk to me."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on!"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Progress.
Leslie Knope,Is it that I sent you a birthday card through the US mail so the post office knew your address?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, is it because I had Food and Stuff temporarily shut down due to a health code violation?"
Leslie Knope,They had fresh produce out right next to the roach spray.
Leslie Knope,It's called Whole Foods.
Leslie Knope,And is that really the reason?
Leslie Knope,As many as I need to to solve this mystery and get us engaged in a deep and stimulating conversation about our friendship.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just wait a second."
Leslie Knope,There's no cursing in the Constitution.
Leslie Knope,"Look, before you do thatâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Woohoo!
Leslie Knope,I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was."
Leslie Knope,"I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such."
Leslie Knope,You mean to tell me you've thought you had an actual land mine on your desk?
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You've been doing an explosive job!
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,It's funny stuff.
Leslie Knope,Who gets angry at balloons?
Leslie Knope,Good talk.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just reading back through some of our old projects, trying to figure out what happened that made you quit."
Leslie Knope,This is a code.
Leslie Knope,I am going to break it.
Leslie Knope,And this is my best shot.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is my job application from when you hired me.
Leslie Knope,Freedom of Information Act request.
Leslie Knope,But here's the thing.
Leslie Knope,I've never read it.
Leslie Knope,This application contains your very first impressions of me.
Leslie Knope,"It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron."
Leslie Knope,The beginning of the whole shebang.
Leslie Knope,This is all you wrote?
Leslie Knope,Three lousy lines?
Leslie Knope,Why don't you read it yourself?
Leslie Knope,You forgot the last sentence.
Leslie Knope,It's a person.
Leslie Knope,It's another person!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we're trapped in here!"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"He's gone, Ron."
Leslie Knope,He's gone.
Leslie Knope,Why did you give me the job?
Leslie Knope,And that's what I don't get.
Leslie Knope,We should've never worked together.
Leslie Knope,Why did you hire me?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that doesn't make any sense."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I remember that interview."
Leslie Knope,You were wearing that exact outfit.
Leslie Knope,"And you said to me, ""Ms. Knope, I have one question for you."""
Leslie Knope,"""What do you believe the role of government is in America?"""
Leslie Knope,"Then you said, ""Everything that just came out of your mouth is basic nonsense."""
Leslie Knope,"""Good day."""
Leslie Knope,And that was it.
Leslie Knope,I most certainly did not.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the thank you note I wrote to you after the interview."
Leslie Knope,You kept it.
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Mr. Swanson, I'm sorry for raising my voice in the interview, and I'm sorry I called you a heartless thug."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, okay."
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"""If it matters, I promise I would never ""raise my voice at you if we worked together."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I was being really optimistic."
Leslie Knope,"""Please enjoy these homemade brownies as a gesture of goodwill."""
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"Ron, look how far we've come."
Leslie Knope,We're doing so great.
Leslie Knope,"Let's just bring it home, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's just talk about our issues.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"If I guess and guess right, you have to tell me."
Leslie Knope,Ready?
Leslie Knope,"Two years ago, you found out you were a quarter French and you had a nervous breakdown."
Leslie Knope,"No, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,"God, no!"
Leslie Knope,That alarm is just for sprinklers.
Leslie Knope,April kept pulling it.
Leslie Knope,So the fire department disconnected it.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,I found some towels.
Leslie Knope,You okay?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look great."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Stop whining, you big baby."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you with your eyebrows blown off.
Leslie Knope,I've seen you without a mustache.
Leslie Knope,I've seen it all.
Leslie Knope,"There's nowhere to run, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You have tried every possible means of escape.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to do but talk.
Leslie Knope,What happened to these workplace proximity associates?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Spill it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, we needed a mindless factotum, and he's the best there is."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Well, my, my, my."
Leslie Knope,Do my eyes deceive me? Is that Ron Swanson?
Leslie Knope,One second.
Leslie Knope,"Did you talk to Randy about the vote? Tell the Northeast that we need to put pressure on them, or else we're gonna be waiting forever, and I'm tired of waiting on them, okay? Okay."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, this is a crazy day."
Leslie Knope,"So what's up with you, you big lug?"
Leslie Knope,I would love to.
Leslie Knope,It's been too long.
Leslie Knope,"JJ's Diner, 12:30?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, get us the first flight out of here and grab the Missouri files."
Leslie Knope,Meet me at my car.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, babe."
Leslie Knope,I got to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,Can you pick up the kids?
Leslie Knope,"Oh... Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I stood you up for lunch."
Leslie Knope,Is that the rest of the story? That I stood you up?
Leslie Knope,You were going to ask me something.
Leslie Knope,That's why you wanted to have lunch.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you were going--"
Leslie Knope,"You missed your friends, and you wanted to come up to the third floor and work with us again."
Leslie Knope,I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you.
Leslie Knope,"God, why didn't I see that?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I am so sorry."
Leslie Knope,I should've been a better friend to you.
Leslie Knope,Your metaphors are so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, there's a way to fix that."
Leslie Knope,England's got a new queen Everybody's really mean We didn't start the fire It was always burning Since the world's been turning
Leslie Knope,"Morning, guys."
Leslie Knope,We're sorry.
Leslie Knope,Fire and money and people
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call."
Leslie Knope,"No, whoever it is, I have zero interest in--"
Leslie Knope,"Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Leslie Knope,I have three years' worth of hugs to force upon you against your will.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is very sweet."
Leslie Knope,But you do realize I gave you this picture six hours ago.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"You big, fat, giant sap."
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,But I feel bad.
Leslie Knope,I don't have anything for you.
Leslie Knope,"For the first time in my life, I am present-less."
Leslie Knope,I'm starving.
Leslie Knope,"April, Ron and I are going to JJ's to eat too much breakfast food."
Leslie Knope,"People are idiots, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,It's impossible.
Leslie Knope,It's not gonna work in a million years.
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.
Leslie Knope,I give up.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, what do you want from me?"
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to get a group of people to give me their land rather than sell it to Gryzzl for 90 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Right now, my basic argument is, ""Please give us the land."""
Leslie Knope,"""It would be so nice."""
Leslie Knope,Gryzzl has billions of dollars.
Leslie Knope,There's no way I beat them.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"""Open your door?"""
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're about to die!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my, The robots have come for us."
Leslie Knope,I made fun of you when you said it would happen but your novel has come true.
Leslie Knope,We're screwed.
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, but I haven't opened it yet."
Leslie Knope,Planning on sending it back after I wrote a sternly worded letter about how I cannot be bought with free gifts.
Leslie Knope,Aww!
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Joe Biden's book, Biden the Rails, 1,001 Poems Inspired by My Travels through Amtrak's Northeast Corridor."
Leslie Knope,A poster of the Supreme Court Justices sipping the Friends milkshake!
Leslie Knope,This stuff is perfect for me.
Leslie Knope,I don't understand what that means but I think I get the context and I love it!
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,We are here today to discuss Gryzzl and whether or not they are invading our privacy.
Leslie Knope,"So, wait."
Leslie Knope,You guys are not against us on this?
Leslie Knope,"Finally, after months of searching for a way to defeat Gryzzl, we have found its Achilles' heel."
Leslie Knope,The town is behind us.
Leslie Knope,Donna is on our side.
Leslie Knope,And the next domino to fall?
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, this is Tom Selloink, but, you know, close enough."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, of course."
Leslie Knope,February 2016.
Leslie Knope,I think you're gonna really enjoy this month's photo album.
Leslie Knope,"It includes such hits as first trip to the dentist, Sonia tries pizza, and water park vomit chain reaction."
Leslie Knope,Why would you not?
Leslie Knope,So cute-- What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Ron technically works for Gryzzl, and when he finds out what Gryzzl is doing, he is going to lose his mind."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Darlene Johannsen, and this is my assistant turned lover, Gregory Strong."
Leslie Knope,"Ours is a new romance, but one that sent shockwaves through my architecture firm."
Leslie Knope,But it feels so right.
Leslie Knope,We love Gryzzl and we would love to see how it all works.
Leslie Knope,"Well, what do you do with this information?"
Leslie Knope,"So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl know all the things that someone wants?"
Leslie Knope,"Are you guys, I don't know, whatever, datamining?"
Leslie Knope,How did you know it was me?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,Just 'cause we're competing for the Newport land doesn't mean that we can't be friends.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that your motto?
Leslie Knope,"""Wouldn't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other?"""
Leslie Knope,"These are really interesting issues, Roscoe."
Leslie Knope,"I think maybe we could debate them, you know, on TV."
Leslie Knope,"We have public opinion on our side, and we have proof that Gryzzl has been datamining."
Leslie Knope,But there's one more thing we need.
Leslie Knope,The one thing that Americans respect more than anything else.
Leslie Knope,Public humiliation on live television.
Leslie Knope,Look at the revision date.
Leslie Knope,"December 18th, 2015."
Leslie Knope,That was the opening day of Episode VII.
Leslie Knope,You were muttering that date in your sleep for months.
Leslie Knope,They knew you'd be distracted.
Leslie Knope,That's how they slipped it in.
Leslie Knope,This is not your fault.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, talk some sense into him."
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna take the fall for this.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, make sure that Donna doesn't hurt him."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Perd--"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think there are certain questions about certain aspects of certain parts of this situation that require an evaluation about whether or not this is or is not a valid argument.
Leslie Knope,They're all down.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,"This Gryzzl thing, it's complicated, but this isn't Ice Town."
Leslie Knope,"You have done so much for this town, and people know that."
Leslie Knope,I thought you didn't like to pass judgment on--
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Gryzzl is scrambling."
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time in this land battle, they are vulnerable and we are gonna capitalize on it with something big and exciting."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"For what I hope is the last time, but we'll assume is not the last time, our strategy does not involve blimps."
Leslie Knope,We already have an idea.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it doesn't, something will."
Leslie Knope,"Because when you and I team up, great things happen."
Leslie Knope,"Ron and I had a little falling out, but we are back, baby."
Leslie Knope,"And just like Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, we are totally in sync."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Just give me a... We're in sync emotionally.
Leslie Knope,Stop patting my head.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,All I wanted was valued at 100 million dollars given to me for free.
Leslie Knope,Is that too much to ask?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's over.
Leslie Knope,They won.
Leslie Knope,Everything is changing.
Leslie Knope,This town is gonna be unrecognizable in 10 years.
Leslie Knope,Even JJ's Diner is disappearing.
Leslie Knope,However many waffles it takes to keep you in business.
Leslie Knope,I'm happy with some of the changes that Pawnee has gone through.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the standard of living is up, we have pressed juice bars, and yoga studios, and a pet hotel."
Leslie Knope,But I think the town is losing some of its charm.
Leslie Knope,And there's too much kale now.
Leslie Knope,One place asked me if I wanted kale in my milkshake.
Leslie Knope,"My milkshake, you guys."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Enough is enough.
Leslie Knope,"They may have taken that land, but I will be damned if they take my waffles."
Leslie Knope,JJ.
Leslie Knope,"No, nothing is ever wrong here."
Leslie Knope,That's why we are gonna fight hard to save your diner.
Leslie Knope,The cologne guy?
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, figures."
Leslie Knope,That guy is the worst.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take him down with an old fashioned public rally.
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you to get the word out, with whatever method of communication young people are using these days."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I think this is a job for Jonathan Karate.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what do you say?"
Leslie Knope,Dynamic duo get together one more time to try to save JJ's Diner?
Leslie Knope,"Hear, hear."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll keep practicing."
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody, listen up."
Leslie Knope,We're here today because JJ's Diner has been a part of Pawnee for 41 years.
Leslie Knope,"And this man, right here, built that diner from the ground up, with his own two hands."
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""constructing a narrative,"" JJ."
Leslie Knope,"You stick to the breakfast, I'll deal with the politics."
Leslie Knope,"So, now, let's hear from a man who knows the value of things staying the same."
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,What do we want?
Leslie Knope,When do we want it?
Leslie Knope,We can't bulldoze our entire history.
Leslie Knope,We need to preserve the things that make Pawnee great.
Leslie Knope,Like JJ's Diner.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, speak of the devil."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the devil, Dennis Feinstein."
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"I am sorry, JJ, that I gave you false hope."
Leslie Knope,"This is a lost cause, just like my stupid park."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I love your energy, Andy, but it's not gonna help us keep JJ's where it is."
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,I'm in.
Leslie Knope,Anything to get away from this cologne smell.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to Beachview Terrace, the sad, unsalvageable, broken down armpit of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and 10 years ago, when he was elected, he promised to clean it up."
Leslie Knope,"Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name, Beachview Terrace."
Leslie Knope,A more accurate name for this place?
Leslie Knope,Medical Waste Butt Sweat Grove.
Leslie Knope,Are you thinkingâ¦
Leslie Knope,But how would we... PR.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have about five days to do three months' worth of work, but if we pull it off, we can rescue JJ's Diner, we can establish a new national park, and we can save Pawnee forever."
Leslie Knope,Who's in?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Where'd you come from?
Leslie Knope,"Well, we just wanted to introduce you to the new home of the Gryzzl campus."
Leslie Knope,"Whereas here at Beachview Terrace, you can take over five entire square blocks of historic Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Here's a far-out idea that just came to the top of my brainium.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you donate that land to the National Park Service?
Leslie Knope,That would be pretty dope.
Leslie Knope,And you could get some baller tax breaks that could help you with that mad stank construction cost.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I can't."
Leslie Knope,I can't say these wordsâ¦
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, we are glad that you picked Pawnee, but if you're gonna set up shop here, you need to make a covenant with the city."
Leslie Knope,Show people that you're invested in this town.
Leslie Knope,"Start by cleaning up one part of Pawnee, and preserving the other."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's been a week."
Leslie Knope,It might not work.
Leslie Knope,"But what if it doesn't? What if we did all that research and handed Gryzzl a fully-formed plan to revitalize an entire neighborhood and build a new national park, and their board still says no?"
Leslie Knope,What makes you so confident?
Leslie Knope,You jerk.
Leslie Knope,You sat on that news and let me stew here for three hours?
Leslie Knope,You jerk! We did it! You jerk.
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, monsters."
Leslie Knope,Mommy and Daddy have to pack because we're going to a hotel.
Leslie Knope,But Roz is going to stay here with you.
Leslie Knope,She's fading.
Leslie Knope,"Roz, Roz."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You are a wonderful nanny.
Leslie Knope,You're tough and strong.
Leslie Knope,And you're an excellent caretaker for our children.
Leslie Knope,I love you more than Ben.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,"If Ben left me, I would be sad but I would get through it."
Leslie Knope,But if you left me I would never recover.
Leslie Knope,Jen Barkley is calling again.
Leslie Knope,She's relentless.
Leslie Knope,"She'll just say what she always says, which is, ""Leslie, would you consider running for state Senate or Congress?"""
Leslie Knope,"And I'll say, ""Jen, thank you very much, that's very flattering but I love my job and I get to do it for the entire country."""
Leslie Knope,The whole world is my park.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, our lives are so chaotic, we can't run a campaign."
Leslie Knope,"It's been three years, we deserve one night away together."
Leslie Knope,A little down time.
Leslie Knope,A little privacy.
Leslie Knope,Maybe we make some more kids?
Leslie Knope,"Let's just make, like, three more so that each one of them can have a friend."
Leslie Knope,Jen?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,"Jen, thank you so much for coming but we have to go."
Leslie Knope,I have never been late for an event that requires an RSVP.
Leslie Knope,"Jen, I told you."
Leslie Knope,I have a dream job.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to --
Leslie Knope,"So, you're thinking about Jen's offer?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Try this.
Leslie Knope,"Tonight, just act like you've decided to run."
Leslie Knope,"And then tomorrow, at the wedding, act like you've decided not to run."
Leslie Knope,See which one feels better.
Leslie Knope,Ben has to run.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to push it because it might backfire but he has to run.
Leslie Knope,He would be good for America.
Leslie Knope,Good for the world.
Leslie Knope,Ben should be the Royal Archduke Sultan Emperor of all inhabitable lands on Earth.
Leslie Knope,I'm completely neutral.
Leslie Knope,I will support you no matter what you do.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Starting now, you're in campaign mode."
Leslie Knope,"So first up, meet and greet."
Leslie Knope,"You remember how this goes, right?"
Leslie Knope,Your goal is to act like everyone is interesting and important.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Too hard.
Leslie Knope,Let's try someone else.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Here's Donna's parents, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Work your magic.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, you are killing it."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I am too.
Leslie Knope,"Ever since we had our kids, it only takes, like, one sip of wine."
Leslie Knope,You know what you should do?
Leslie Knope,You should give a toast.
Leslie Knope,"Because if you were running for Congress, you have to give speeches, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Toast it, baby."
Leslie Knope,Roast it and toast it till it's brown on both sides!
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,He's talkin' about me.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, mine's filled with concrete."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so... Yesterday, you pretended you were going to run."
Leslie Knope,"Today, you're going to pretend like you're not going to run."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we did."
Leslie Knope,I also called 867-5309 100 times.
Leslie Knope,Bad.
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jen."
Leslie Knope,8675309
Leslie Knope,"Jenny, I got your number-- Hey, babe, it's ringing!"
Leslie Knope,"Honey, you were a lot more lucid than I was."
Leslie Knope,"No, we weren't--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Look at how beautiful you look.
Leslie Knope,But you're going to be very soon.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What a complicated tapestry that is.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Roz."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have the zebras."
Leslie Knope,"Tell the kids not to worry, they're coming back home."
Leslie Knope,"Also, we want to give you a raise."
Leslie Knope,And anything you want to take from our house.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,"I told you, I'm neutral."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I think they should all be bigger."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,I think you should run.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, our lives are bonkers but if something is worth it, and I think this is, then you just make it work."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I just read an article on two minute micro-naps and the science on them is very promising."
Leslie Knope,"My God, babe, that was so hot."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, the central question that these senators are going to be asking is why should we invest in the National Park Service?"
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,"I know you're kidding, but I also know that you're prepared, and we are going to do great."
Leslie Knope,How psyched are you about this trip?
Leslie Knope,"April, are you super psyched?"
Leslie Knope,I do?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Good looking out.
Leslie Knope,We're a great team.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,On what grounds?
Leslie Knope,Those-- those fonts are perfect.
Leslie Knope,It's readable and compact.
Leslie Knope,It's all on one page.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,Don't mess with that.
Leslie Knope,"I appreciate your initiative, but itineraries are not the right place to mess around."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Carryon bags packed, trashy magazines purchased, boarding passes in hand, and we have 26 minutes for unstructured chat time."
Leslie Knope,What do you want to talk about?
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could talk about your future.
Leslie Knope,You want to talk about your future?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I figured."
Leslie Knope,It's hard at your age to figure out your path.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I was going to surprise you with this in Washington, but what the heck."
Leslie Knope,It's unstructured chat time.
Leslie Knope,So Tada!
Leslie Knope,"This is your clear, definitive path through the federal government."
Leslie Knope,It starts here today with this flight and it goes all the way to 2022.
Leslie Knope,"Cool, right?"
Leslie Knope,"I had to make some guesses about your ultimate government objectives and your fashion choices, etcetera."
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, with this, you don't have to worry."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,Gov Buds for Life?
Leslie Knope,"Just a little fun I was having, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't really make the shirts.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I did."
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Leslie Knope,April!
Leslie Knope,Group One is boarding.
Leslie Knope,Copy that.
Leslie Knope,"April, when Randy brings up the river project, that is your cue toâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's just April.
Leslie Knope,Trust me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think it's the only move, Senator Boxer."
Leslie Knope,I don't think this chance is going to come around again.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have another great idea."
Leslie Knope,"How about you and me, April, Randy, ""Historical Lampposts of D.C."" walking tour?"
Leslie Knope,Starts in 15 minutes.
Leslie Knope,Can we come?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Senator Gillibrand."
Leslie Knope,We really appreciate your support.
Leslie Knope,Would you mind signing a copy of your book?
Leslie Knope,I took the liberty of writing the inscription.
Leslie Knope,All you have to do is sign.
Leslie Knope,And there's room for a P.S. If you feel there's more you left out.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Senator."
Leslie Knope,Do you have a minute to chat?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you Actually, I checked with your staff, and they said that you have a free half hour."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Every month of my life since fourth grade.
Leslie Knope,"Now, let's talk about National Parks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to say I'm very surprised that the two of you are seeing eye to eye on this one."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I do get it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, five yeses and four noes."
Leslie Knope,Not a bad start.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Old Norbs is stepping down.
Leslie Knope,"Couldn't handle the pressure, huh?"
Leslie Knope,What a wuss.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I feel bad about what I said before.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I have to enroll in SESCDP?
Leslie Knope,Forty four weeks of intensive courses and notetaking?
Leslie Knope,"Um, it's a dream come true."
Leslie Knope,A confirmation hearing?
Leslie Knope,A freaking confirmation hearing?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me a second.
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"To the best of my recollection, yes, I accept the job."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,Do you mind if I borrow your hat?
Leslie Knope,I just want to throw it up in the air victoriously.
Leslie Knope,Ma'am?
Leslie Knope,"Look around, April."
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Leslie Knope,I see a new home.
Leslie Knope,"I am going to take that job, Ben's going to run for Congress, he will win eventually, and then we're going to split our time between Washington and Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"For us, April."
Leslie Knope,For us.
Leslie Knope,"No, they put that in in the '70s."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am so ahead of my five year plan."
Leslie Knope,Which means that you're going to need a new five year plan.
Leslie Knope,And here it is.
Leslie Knope,I keep a local bindermaker on retainer in D.C.
Leslie Knope,We are about to embark on such an amazing journey.
Leslie Knope,"This is going to be our city, and this is going to be our bench."
Leslie Knope,"April, we have a bench in D.C."
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,You quit?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Ben who?
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt?
Leslie Knope,He's been helping you behind my back?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,We had a good run.
Leslie Knope,But he's dead to me now.
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you're quitting.
Leslie Knope,And I cannot believe this is the first time I'm hearing it.
Leslie Knope,"And on our bench, of all places."
Leslie Knope,It's just so frustrating.
Leslie Knope,"I love her, but you spend so much time and effort on someone's life and she's just going to quit on me?"
Leslie Knope,"It's like, what's the point, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Five.
Leslie Knope,"Well, eight if you count all those times I showed up unannounced at your office with mini muffins."
Leslie Knope,"Well, because when I knew I would be coming to Washington to work, I wore you down until you agreed to become my friend."
Leslie Knope,Name one time I've done that.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, once again, Madeleine Albright."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for letting me wear it.
Leslie Knope,It just makes me feel very powerful.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I blew up at you yesterday.
Leslie Knope,"I really want all of my friends to be happy together, but more importantly, I just want them to be happy."
Leslie Knope,"If you feel like you need to move on, I totally get it."
Leslie Knope,What? Why?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know you do.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, April."
Leslie Knope,"So, you don't have any idea what you want to do?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, here's the good news."
Leslie Knope,I am on the case.
Leslie Knope,I know some people who might be able to help us.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"April, this is Alyssa, from the American Service Foundation."
Leslie Knope,"They take young people like you who are trying to explore a new path, and match them with one of the thousands of jobs across America that help communities."
Leslie Knope,"Alyssa, this is April Ludgate, the single greatest human being ever, and you need to find her a job that she will love and cherish and make her life feel complete."
Leslie Knope,They contacted us last year because they wanted to place some people in National Parks.
Leslie Knope,Not my best work.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you changed your hair."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to send you another one.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go solve all of your career problems.
Leslie Knope,I'll wait right here.
Leslie Knope,That a girl.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Madeleine."
Leslie Knope,"They're taking forever, and I'm starting to lose it."
Leslie Knope,"Talk to me, okay? Your voice makes me calm."
Leslie Knope,Tell me another Yeltsin story.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, she's here."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Say hi to your daughters.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,How did it go?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Is it Teach for America? No.
Leslie Knope,Habitat for Humanity? No.
Leslie Knope,It's working with animals.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"I am 100,000% in support of this idea."
Leslie Knope,This is an amazing idea.
Leslie Knope,I love this idea.
Leslie Knope,And I love you.
Leslie Knope,"So, are they hiring? What did Alyssa say when you told her?"
Leslie Knope,You wanted to run something by me?
Leslie Knope,"April, you don't need me."
Leslie Knope,You can get any job you want all by yourself.
Leslie Knope,"Obviously, I'm going to vet your resume and we'll hold some mock-interviews and I'll choose your outfit and everything."
Leslie Knope,But you can get this sucker on your own.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, shop talk."
Leslie Knope,"One of my five favorite types of talk, along with pillow, girl, real, and TED."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,We have to skip that?
Leslie Knope,I love watching those squashes fly through the air.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,"Me, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was an actual candidate, so I think I can handle being a candidate's wife."
Leslie Knope,I know all the issues inside and out.
Leslie Knope,I think you're underestimating the voters.
Leslie Knope,"Stephen, be careful."
Leslie Knope,"The Pie Mary is a Southern Indiana tradition, where Congressional candidates' wives face off in a pie baking contest."
Leslie Knope,The last contest's winner was June Hartwell's buttermilk meringue.
Leslie Knope,Last contest's loser was all women.
Leslie Knope,We're-- I'm not making any kind of statement.
Leslie Knope,"We're just focusing on bigger issues, like Ben's 150 million dollar revitalization project."
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,I'm standing right here in front of you.
Leslie Knope,None of your business.
Leslie Knope,And thank you for noticing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it only took three hours for Jen to be right."
Leslie Knope,I'm officially a distraction.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna enter that Pie Mary.
Leslie Knope,"But the more they talk about this, the less they're gonna talk about your economic plan."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I'm good at making pies, so I'll win and then I can promote my self-published women's rights barbecue cookbook The Feminine Mesquite."
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, snacks given, kids tucked in, books read, three simultaneous meltdowns for no reason, kids tucked back in, one of them briefly got outside somehow, kids back in bed, they're all napping."
Leslie Knope,You know me so well.
Leslie Knope,That might be one of the kids.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my goodness, Elise."
Leslie Knope,"Please, come in."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Are you here to give me the Woman of the Year award?
Leslie Knope,I have a speech prepared.
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see it?
Leslie Knope,Right now?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I agree that it's dumb."
Leslie Knope,"But this is not about me, it's about Ben, and he will do more for women than Hartwell."
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, lose a battle, win the war."
Leslie Knope,That kind of thing.
Leslie Knope,It's the way to go.
Leslie Knope,Elise.
Leslie Knope,There is no bigger defender of gender equality than Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"And my husband, Ben, is a progressive champion of women's rights."
Leslie Knope,The IOW does not mess around.
Leslie Knope,"Which normally is why I love them, but now I'm on the other side."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ben, I gave them 100 dollars in their annual pledge."
Leslie Knope,Do you know how many anti-me signs that could buy?
Leslie Knope,Then we're just back where we started.
Leslie Knope,Then it just seems like I'm saying I'm better than the women who bake.
Leslie Knope,What should we do?
Leslie Knope,Should we get a divorce?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that could work."
Leslie Knope,"We sidestep the controversy, we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate."
Leslie Knope,And then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head.
Leslie Knope,"I feel like that's not more important, but I like the energy that we have, so let's hear it."
Leslie Knope,A pie.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Of course you can, baby."
Leslie Knope,Get in there and start baking.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,We're good.
Leslie Knope,The IOW is not gonna protest us.
Leslie Knope,How's your pie?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,How is your dessert calzone?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,What's happening now?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!
Leslie Knope,I'm not forcing him to do anything!
Leslie Knope,He loves to cook.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He has five personalized aprons.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,How about this weather we're having?
Leslie Knope,Very temperate.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Recently, I made an attempt to--"
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,The first thing I'm gonna do is say sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that the spotlight is on me and not on Ben, because he is going to make a great congressman."
Leslie Knope,"Second, the Male Men. Where are you? Ah."
Leslie Knope,"You're ridiculous, and men's rights is nothing."
Leslie Knope,"Third, I'm now gonna give you permanent answers to all the silly questions that you're gonna end up asking me, and every other woman in this election, over the next few months."
Leslie Knope,"""Why did I change my hairstyle?"" Oh, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,I just thought it would look better.
Leslie Knope,Or my kids got gum in it.
Leslie Knope,"""Are you trying to have it all?"" That question makes no sense."
Leslie Knope,It's a stupid question.
Leslie Knope,Stop asking it.
Leslie Knope,Don't ask it.
Leslie Knope,"""Do you miss your kids while you're at work?"" Yes, of course I do."
Leslie Knope,Everybody does.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you know, sometimes I don't."
Leslie Knope,"My mom, babe."
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna bake a pie, that's great."
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna have a career, that's great, too."
Leslie Knope,"Do both, or neither, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,Just don't judge what someone else has decided to do.
Leslie Knope,We're all just trying to find the right path for us.
Leslie Knope,As individuals.
Leslie Knope,On this Earth.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That seems about right.
Leslie Knope,He just spoke.
Leslie Knope,What did I do wrong now?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Son of a bitch.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I needed all eleven disks of Gossip Girl at the same time.
Leslie Knope,"They give you a little wand, and a diploma."
Leslie Knope,It's fun.
Leslie Knope,Potions.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm gonna take you off speaker phone."
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay-- Um, I wore those once."
Leslie Knope,"It was a moneyback guarantee, but I forgot to return them."
Leslie Knope,"Man Pillow, the pillow shaped like a man?"
Leslie Knope,"Also something called ""Bucket of Cake."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,I think someone definitely stole my credit card.
Leslie Knope,So why don't you just cancel it?
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't have to refund anything."
Leslie Knope,Just cancel the credit card and we'll all go on with our lives.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Daniel Craig.
Leslie Knope,It's for my lower back.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're here in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,It's two towns over.
Leslie Knope,"And we're all volunteering for Kaboom, a service organization that says it builds a playground in a day."
Leslie Knope,I never trust anything that comes that quickly.
Leslie Knope,That's why I don't eat Minute Rice.
Leslie Knope,"So this whole ""build a playground in a day"" thing, I mean, that's just a slogan, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Keef, that is so incredible."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I work in Parks, and I know how hard it is to get something done."
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but just think of all the kids that'll swing on this swing: fat kids, skinny kids, brainiacs, sluts, the gay drama kids, goths, jocks, the alternative crowd."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,You have been officially kaboomed.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"No, I wish, but back to the real world."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so pumped."
Leslie Knope,Feel I could take on the world.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we are."
Leslie Knope,It's just a slow boom.
Leslie Knope,"A slower, more deliberate kaboom."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know what this mess is?
Leslie Knope,This is a list of things we have to complete before we fill in the pit behind Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,You know what this is?
Leslie Knope,This is a kaboomer.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, did you use permanent marker again?"
Leslie Knope,This is a big--
Leslie Knope,"This is gonna open very big, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,Let's all pretend Jerry wasn't born.
Leslie Knope,And this is clean.
Leslie Knope,How do we speed up the process?
Leslie Knope,How do we kaboom it?
Leslie Knope,"Rules, codes, permits, red tape."
Leslie Knope,I never realized how frustrating it is to be in the government.
Leslie Knope,"In my next life, I'm going into private industry."
Leslie Knope,Maybe strip mining.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody take out their thinking caps and rip them up."
Leslie Knope,"Then take out your doing caps, 'cause we're gonna do something today."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Focus, please."
Leslie Knope,How do we cut through the red tape and how do we get this pit filled in?
Leslie Knope,Ideas?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody else needs to participate."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,These suggestions aren't gonna suggest themselves.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,This idea better be good.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, buddy, you're not listening to me."
Leslie Knope,I want to kaboom it.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Mark's gonna help me, so thanks for nothing, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Good job, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, I am so sick of moving like a slug."
Leslie Knope,I want to move like a cheetah.
Leslie Knope,Or a slug driving a remote controlled car.
Leslie Knope,"Something more plausible than that, but fast."
Leslie Knope,I won't murder.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like that."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wow."
Leslie Knope,So who gives me the go ahead to not ask for permission but ask for forgiveness?
Leslie Knope,Is it Ron?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Say you had a friend who wanted to do something good, but a little risky, and she was kind of nervous about it, and this friend is me."
Leslie Knope,What should I do?
Leslie Knope,You'll help me?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna murder anyone.
Leslie Knope,It was crazy.
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a single permit.
Leslie Knope,Nobody stamped anything.
Leslie Knope,"All I did was order a backhoe, and it came with a guy who runs it."
Leslie Knope,I've never rented a guy before.
Leslie Knope,I wish I knew about that during prom.
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited we're doing this.
Leslie Knope,And we're doing it without permission.
Leslie Knope,We're giving ourselves permission.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I had these hard hats made."
Leslie Knope,Check it out.
Leslie Knope,"Kick, Ass."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann, this is so cool."
Leslie Knope,Do you feel giddy?
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud of us.
Leslie Knope,"I didn't wanna tell him my real name, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"First, speech."
Leslie Knope,Is important moment here.
Leslie Knope,"We are about to fill this hole now, not with dirt, but with the courage of a thousand lions and the solemn memory of all of our friends who have fallen in this cursed hole."
Leslie Knope,Dump it!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry about Andy, but I'm not sorry about what I did."
Leslie Knope,What's my crime?
Leslie Knope,I got bold?
Leslie Knope,And a little negligent?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Can I smoke in here?
Leslie Knope,Just asking if I can.
Leslie Knope,I'm high on kaboom.
Leslie Knope,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry."
Leslie Knope,It's awful what happened to Andy.
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes when you make an omelet, you got to break a few eggs."
Leslie Knope,What's the alternative?
Leslie Knope,No omelets at all?
Leslie Knope,Who wants to live in that kind of world?
Leslie Knope,Maybe birds.
Leslie Knope,Then all their babies would live.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Scott."
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that you were friends with Andy.
Leslie Knope,Is that all you lawyers think about?
Leslie Knope,"Lawsuits, and laws and legalese?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can relax."
Leslie Knope,"All I'm gonna do is go in and just say, ""We are so sorry, it's entirely our fault"""
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,I have to apologize.
Leslie Knope,Andy was a victim--
Leslie Knope,Of an extremely unfortunate situation.
Leslie Knope,"I can't say the word ""situation""?"
Leslie Knope,Can I give him the pig?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Andy."
Leslie Knope,I got this for you.
Leslie Knope,Hope you squeal better.
Leslie Knope,This is my friend Scott.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I just wanted to say, I am so, so"
Leslie Knope,"Filled with emotions, as any person would."
Leslie Knope,Uh... you were in the pit.
Leslie Knope,You were in a place.
Leslie Knope,We're both here now.
Leslie Knope,The government--
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, no."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you're suing your hometown?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, can we just talk about this?"
Leslie Knope,This is terrible.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said it's your only option?
Leslie Knope,I think we should talk.
Leslie Knope,Without lawyers present.
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna meet, just put a white chalk ""X"" on the mailbox across the street from City Hall."
Leslie Knope,Or call me back.
Leslie Knope,Just call me back.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why aren't you returning my calls?"
Leslie Knope,Is it because of your lawyer?
Leslie Knope,It's because of your lawyer.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy, it's your aunt, your mom or dad's sister."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to tell you this but your uncle has passed.
Leslie Knope,He's with Jesus now.
Leslie Knope,So we're having a memorial in 30 minutes at City Hall.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Free guitars at City Hall!
Leslie Knope,Everybody run!
Leslie Knope,"Because of a local disaster, you, Andy Dwyer, must go to the evacuation center at Pawnee City Hall."
Leslie Knope,How long have you been there?
Leslie Knope,I promise that Andy isn't suing just for the money.
Leslie Knope,"I feel like if I could get past the lawyers and find out what's really going on, I think I could get him to drop the lawsuit."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so--
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Has he showed up naked before?
Leslie Knope,Where are you--
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann. Just--"
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said this was your only option?
Leslie Knope,I just can't believe that you're suing just for the money.
Leslie Knope,That doesn't sound like Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes, I think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, I tried to fill in the pit, that didn't work either."
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.
Leslie Knope,"I know I just said that maybe shortcuts are bad, but I kind of just thought of an awesome shortcut."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's really terrific."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Never.
Leslie Knope,I will not negotiate with greedy street people.
Leslie Knope,We planned this.
Leslie Knope,"I think that Andy seems like he doesn't care so much about the second one, and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit."
Leslie Knope,"What do you say, Scott?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say it, but it really seems like Andy has us over a barrel here, Scott."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Usually, in these situations, a person says ""pinch me."""
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Just one of his conditions for the settlement, I guess."
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Gave up 100,000 dollars probably just for one thing, the city fill in the pit behind your house."
Leslie Knope,Who knows? Who knows why that gopher does what he does?
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, pit."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, lot."
Leslie Knope,How does taking risks make me feel? Amazing.
Leslie Knope,Tingling sensation throughout my whole body.
Leslie Knope,I feel flushed.
Leslie Knope,"My muscles are relaxed, yet I feel awake."
Leslie Knope,Just waves of pleasure.
Leslie Knope,I wish there was something physical that could make me feel this way.
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, we're so close."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna call Kaboom, and check on their availability for next year."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, yes, I'd like the number for Kaboom, the national playground building charity."
Leslie Knope,I hope they can work us in.
Leslie Knope,What? Are you sure?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Johnny Karate!"
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy to be here on your last show ever.
Leslie Knope,I am going to be taking over hosting my friend's TV show.
Leslie Knope,"Isn't that right, April?"
Leslie Knope,"Andy Dwyer/ Johnny Karate, this is your life!"
Leslie Knope,Welcome back.
Leslie Knope,"When I first met the man standing next to me, he was not a cultural phenomenon."
Leslie Knope,He was going through a tough time.
Leslie Knope,He had just broken both legs from falling into a pit.
Leslie Knope,"It's a kid's show, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Kid's show.
Leslie Knope,"That event set in motion many wonderful things in my life, including the building of the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,"So, in a weird way, Andy, I owe it all to you."
Leslie Knope,Andy pulled his life together and he got himself a job at the shoeshine stand in City Hall.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hi."
Leslie Knope,"To commemorate that time and to make sure that you never miss another appointment again, we have brought you a monogrammed day planner."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,"From then, Andy went to England for a few months to work for a nonprofit."
Leslie Knope,"It was there that he befriended the 14th Earl of Cornwall upon Thames, Sir Edgar Covington."
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Leslie Knope,"Friend, coworker, musician, husband Andy Dwyer--"
Leslie Knope,Sir Andy Dwyer had become so many things to so many people.
Leslie Knope,But his greatest creation was yet to come.
Leslie Knope,A salute to Johnny Karate when we come back!
Leslie Knope,"Every hero struggles with failure, faces something they cannot do."
Leslie Knope,Andy faced one of those moments just a few years ago.
Leslie Knope,"No, you did not achieve your dream of becoming a Pawnee police officer."
Leslie Knope,"But you did create Burt Macklin, a character who exemplifies everything that is great about law enforcement."
Leslie Knope,Take a look.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Andy, now that you are an official police officer--"
Leslie Knope,You should be able to solve the case of the missing guitar.
Leslie Knope,"So, grab your clue and head on over to Professor Smartbrain."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"And now it's time to celebrate Andy Dwyer's greatest creation, Johnny Karate."
Leslie Knope,He has brought so much happiness to so many children in southern Indiana that we thought a piece of Johnny Karate should stay here in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Raise it up!
Leslie Knope,That karate gi will stay here forever.
Leslie Knope,"Well, not here, here, because this studio actually has a show where divorced couples work out their problems, so that might be weird if that thing was hanging over them."
Leslie Knope,But it'll be somewhere.
Leslie Knope,And the spirit will stay with us.
Leslie Knope,Forever.
Leslie Knope,"Andy Dwyer's final goodbye, when we come back."
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone just officially enrolled in the Senior Executive Service Development Candidate Program at the Department of the Interior."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,It's a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"So, my promotion is official."
Leslie Knope,We need to find a place in D.C.
Leslie Knope,Because we're gonna be splitting our time.
Leslie Knope,Cheers.
Leslie Knope,Everyone's scattering.
Leslie Knope,"Well, look at it this way."
Leslie Knope,"Bad news comes in threes, right?"
Leslie Knope,"We're leaving, April and Andy are leaving, Donna's leaving."
Leslie Knope,That's three!
Leslie Knope,"That's three, Garry."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're probably due for some good news."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you jinxed us, Garry."
Leslie Knope,Thanks a lot.
Leslie Knope,"People are dying, moving, retiring."
Leslie Knope,"Too many endings, not enough beginnings."
Leslie Knope,We need something to begin.
Leslie Knope,And I have just the thing.
Leslie Knope,An underground dance competition.
Leslie Knope,I'm realizing I know nothing about the logistics of how to start an underground dance competition.
Leslie Knope,But someone here will.
Leslie Knope,You did.
Leslie Knope,What did you get me?
Leslie Knope,Oohlala.
Leslie Knope,Men's Ferragamo loafers.
Leslie Knope,What am I supposed to do with these?
Leslie Knope,How was your trip?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is perfect.
Leslie Knope,"What with everything ending, you guys are the happy beginning that we all need."
Leslie Knope,You should propose to her.
Leslie Knope,Right now.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,What better place to ask a woman to marry you than an old man's public memorial?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you'd probably want her here for that, right?"
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so sad.
Leslie Knope,They worked together for a long time.
Leslie Knope,What is happening?
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Listen to Ethel.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Listen to her message.
Leslie Knope,You can't wait to tell someone how you feel.
Leslie Knope,"Because if you wait, before you know it Boom!"
Leslie Knope,"46 years later, they're gone."
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,And I will help you with the proposal.
Leslie Knope,What do you wanna do?
Leslie Knope,Tom Haverford
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, um People grieve in different ways."
Leslie Knope,"Listen, if you can't train 200 white doves in the next four hours to spell out ""Lucy, will you marry me?"", then you have no business calling yourself a pet store."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,I really don't.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, lan."
Leslie Knope,"I need a gigantic banner that says ""Congratulations, Lucy and Tom,"" and I need it by tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Over the past 15 years, I have spent nearly a hundred thousand dollars at your banner store."
Leslie Knope,I have ordered banners for every personal and professional event that I've ever organized.
Leslie Knope,"My credit card company called me about it, not to question the charges, but to sincerely ask me if I was mentally stable."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, there's your mark, you'll enter from the front."
Leslie Knope,"Ted, are we rolling?"
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Quiet on the set!
Leslie Knope,Action.
Leslie Knope,"'Allo, would you like to see some rings, Agent Haverford?"
Leslie Knope,I came up with a backstory for my character.
Leslie Knope,"She's married to a French billionaire, and she has a twin sister, identical, and they keep--"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I committed to the role!"
Leslie Knope,'Allo.
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see some gorgeous jewelry?
Leslie Knope,We have the most rare diamonds in the world.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Zut alors!
Leslie Knope,Freeze.
Leslie Knope,Stunt double.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Action!
Leslie Knope,Rack focus.
Leslie Knope,Pan left.
Leslie Knope,Just get the right Go under the--
Leslie Knope,And cut.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my gosh."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, that was amazing!"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"It's the movie business, Ted."
Leslie Knope,You knew the risks.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody in the van."
Leslie Knope,We're headed to the next location.
Leslie Knope,I'm cool?
Leslie Knope,I'm cool.
Leslie Knope,I'm a cool dudette.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,It's pizza time.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Is it because I said, ""It's pizza time""?"
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,"I have no idea what's happening, and I'm very scared that everything is falling apart."
Leslie Knope,But you seem like James Bond right now.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, what are we doing?"
Leslie Knope,There are hundreds of people waiting for us.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I will leave.
Leslie Knope,Good luck.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I already picked a place."
Leslie Knope,Don't follow me!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That was so sweet.
Leslie Knope,Why are you like this?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You were right to change course.
Leslie Knope,It was perfect and beautiful.
Leslie Knope,There's still a very big celebration awaiting you and your fiancee.
Leslie Knope,"Catch you on the flipside, Tom-egranate Juice."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, babe."
Leslie Knope,Tom got engaged.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad we're leaving.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,You know what? I just had an amazing idea.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ian, thank you so much."
Leslie Knope,It's great.
Leslie Knope,"Now, throw it out."
Leslie Knope,"I need a new one, and I need it in 20 minutes."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,"If you didn't wanna be on call 24/7 for emergencies, then you should not have gone into the high-stakes world of banner making!"
Leslie Knope,"Happy Inauguration Day, buddy."
Leslie Knope,The passing of our beloved Mayor Gunderson marks the end of an era.
Leslie Knope,But we are about to begin a new chapter in Pawnee's history.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the new mayor of the great city of Pawnee, Indiana, Garry Gergich!"
Leslie Knope,Which brings us to 2005.
Leslie Knope,"The Circle Park renovation was complete, and a young man named Thomas Haverford was still two years away from getting hired."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I planned a comprehensive retrospective, but I guess I can just focus on the really important moments."
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,The debate about getting a pod-based coffee machine.
Leslie Knope,Garry and I wrote a little musical number about that.
Leslie Knope,And it goes a little something like this.
Leslie Knope,"No, April, Ron, we need to celebrate everything that we've done together as a group."
Leslie Knope,This is our last day here.
Leslie Knope,Who knows when we'll all be together like this again?
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, sir, we can help."
Leslie Knope,"We can, and we will."
Leslie Knope,"Because when we used to work here, helping people was our job."
Leslie Knope,Forget about these old stories.
Leslie Knope,Let's make a new one.
Leslie Knope,Let's fix the swing.
Leslie Knope,One last ride for the Parks and Rec gang.
Leslie Knope,Who's in?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, what is our first step on our quest to help this man?"
Leslie Knope,Does anyone remember?
Leslie Knope,Correct!
Leslie Knope,Five points for Hufflepuff.
Leslie Knope,I knew those scrapbooks were going to come in handy.
Leslie Knope,You came through like you always do.
Leslie Knope,"God, I'm going to miss you."
Leslie Knope,"Your confidence, your joie de vivre."
Leslie Knope,That crazy story about you getting kicked out of En Vogue.
Leslie Knope,When do you leave for Seattle?
Leslie Knope,"Well, whatever happens, I know that you are going to live an exciting and full life."
Leslie Knope,We are on one last mission to help the people of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"You know, Craig, when I first met you, I thought, ""There is a man who loves his job."""
Leslie Knope,"And then I thought, ""Oh, wow, he's intense."""
Leslie Knope,"And then I thought, ""Oh, no, he's insane."""
Leslie Knope,"""That person is psychotic, and I need to call the police."""
Leslie Knope,But I just think you've come so far.
Leslie Knope,And I'm so glad that we are leaving the Parks Department in your hands.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"April and Andy, I need to file this."
Leslie Knope,Would anyone like to accompany me to the fourth floor?
Leslie Knope,We're just taking the elevator.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,I heard.
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.
Leslie Knope,"We need this filed, please."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Andy, all of those things, including me, will still be with you in Washington."
Leslie Knope,I just want to say that we are about to embark on an amazing adventure.
Leslie Knope,"And whatever happens, just know that Ben and I are always there for you."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Always nice to see Janet Snakehole and Burt Macklin in the mix.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm Sandra Dee O'Connor."
Leslie Knope,Get it?
Leslie Knope,Sandra Dee plus Sandra Day O'Connor?
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,It's not about trying to make your life perfect.
Leslie Knope,Nobody's lives are perfect.
Leslie Knope,"You have kids because you and Andy are a team, and you want to bring in some new team members."
Leslie Knope,I don't know if you should have kids.
Leslie Knope,I really don't.
Leslie Knope,But I do like your team.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I want to scream, but I don't want to wake up my godchild."
Leslie Knope,"I'm assuming it's my godchild, right?"
Leslie Knope,We can talk about it later.
Leslie Knope,What's his name?
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to the team, little guy."
Leslie Knope,"I know just where to take it, Ethel."
Leslie Knope,And I know just the person who should accompany me.
Leslie Knope,"Not you, Kyle."
Leslie Knope,"How many times did you and I deliver a form to maintenance, just like this?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so many great conversations, bonding and mentoring moments."
Leslie Knope,It seems only right that we make this journey one final time.
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is our last day in Pawnee and we have one last problem to fix."
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,You're not injured?
Leslie Knope,Jean-Ralphio.
Leslie Knope,"Although I truly hope that I never see you again, I do wish you a long and happy life."
Leslie Knope,So Tom and I have a swing to fix.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man, I forgot that maintenance was closed on Fridays."
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, Tom, you have accomplished so much, you have come so far, now you're so successful"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and well-dressed."
Leslie Knope,I am so very proud of you.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this is incredible."
Leslie Knope,"A bestselling book, a 40 city tour."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the book is called Failure."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to take that.
Leslie Knope,"""Best wishes."""
Leslie Knope,"So, how are we going to fix this swing?"
Leslie Knope,Hold a public forum?
Leslie Knope,Have a rally?
Leslie Knope,Smash that door and do some looting?
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mayor Gergich."
Leslie Knope,You really saved our butts.
Leslie Knope,I am so happy that you get to be mayor.
Leslie Knope,Are you enjoying yourself?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,"Rest in peace, friend."
Leslie Knope,Close enough.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,How's this for a headline?
Leslie Knope,"""Still Swinging: Parks Gang Reunites for One Last Bang."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's a headline, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,Sex sells.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Not bad craftsmanship, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"So, you think you're going to stick around Pawnee?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're going to come back here a lot."
Leslie Knope,You know what they say.
Leslie Knope,Don't be a stranger.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your family is beautiful."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ron, what brings you here?"
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,I love personal crossroads.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's take a walk."
Leslie Knope,There's a cute little park nearby.
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you want to do now?"
Leslie Knope,"Say no more, you big softie."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to spend every waking moment trying to figure this out for you.
Leslie Knope,You want to stay for dinner?
Leslie Knope,We're having steak.
Leslie Knope,But we're also hosting several members of the House Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for meeting me here.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You want to run it?
Leslie Knope,"The superintendent of Bryce Canyon retired, and I convinced the superintendent of this park to transfer, shuffled a few things around."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, someone needs to take care of this place now."
Leslie Knope,Thought it should be you.
Leslie Knope,Your job would be to walk around the land alone.
Leslie Knope,You'd live in the same town you've always lived in.
Leslie Knope,"You'd work outside, you'd talk to bears."
Leslie Knope,Next argument.
Leslie Knope,"Well, a few people might be annoyed."
Leslie Knope,But they'll get over it.
Leslie Knope,"And as far as your qualifications, you're Ron Swanson."
Leslie Knope,Stop being a dummy and accept.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, today."
Leslie Knope,I already accepted for you.
Leslie Knope,I still remember how to forge your signature.
Leslie Knope,Let's go meet your staff.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee National Park Rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new superintendent and boss."
Leslie Knope,Well said.
Leslie Knope,"You're welcome, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Babe, I don't want to seem dramatic, but I have just reconsidered every decision that we have made over the last year and I think we need to stay in Pawnee forever."
Leslie Knope,But when is this group of people ever going to be all together again?
Leslie Knope,That's all I want.
Leslie Knope,All of these people in the same place at the same time.
Leslie Knope,What's going to happen between now and then?
Leslie Knope,You promise?
Leslie Knope,You say that every time we're here.
Leslie Knope,I think I am past that point.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to worry about me anymore.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, as long as we get to play charades later."
Leslie Knope,"Damn, that food was good."
Leslie Knope,I've said it before and I'll say it again.
Leslie Knope,Joe Biden knows his way around a seafood risotto.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, the point is, yes, I do like working at Interior."
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,But I'm always looking for new challenges.
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?
Leslie Knope,For governor of Indiana?
Leslie Knope,Someone's been reading my kindergarten dream journal.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is exciting."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to take this energy and I'm going to go crush Joe Biden in charades.
Leslie Knope,Dr. Jill?
Leslie Knope,Let's pick teams.
Leslie Knope,So I had a pretty interesting conversation with Janet from the DNC tonight.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"She said that Governor Colquitt might be stepping down, and the DNC thinks that I should run for governor."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, obviouslyâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, obviously, weâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Pros of you running for governor.
Leslie Knope,You would be a great governor.
Leslie Knope,We could make Pawnee our home base.
Leslie Knope,The kids could go to school in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And it would be a huge career move for you.
Leslie Knope,The pros of me running for governor are the same thing.
Leslie Knope,It's the same list.
Leslie Knope,The only con of you running would be that I don't get to run.
Leslie Knope,And vice versa.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,We're going back to Pawnee in a week.
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just talk about it after that?
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,"No, but we don't have a choice, do we?"
Leslie Knope,Kids!
Leslie Knope,Dinner!
Leslie Knope,Don't forget your ice skates.
Leslie Knope,You have a lesson tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"You know, now that I'm here, it's giving me an idea about this governor thing."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we need fresh eyes.
Leslie Knope,"You know, other people to weigh in."
Leslie Knope,We should talk to Ron.
Leslie Knope,Or Tom.
Leslie Knope,Or April.
Leslie Knope,Or Donna.
Leslie Knope,"Or Andy, even."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes, he can be wise."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe you.
Leslie Knope,We're all here together in the same room.
Leslie Knope,In this room.
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could be happier right now.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann's here."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,Ann's here.
Leslie Knope,"You guys, Ann's here."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,"Your hair looks amazing, by the way."
Leslie Knope,You look like a cartoon princess.
Leslie Knope,"I took some of those, but I don't know, they didn't do anything and they kind of upset my stomach."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's confusing, because they're delicious."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you rainbow-infused space unicorn."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful, sassy mannequin come to life."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you opalescent tree shark."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,What's that thing on your wrist?
Leslie Knope,Aren't you afraid that thing might give you cancer?
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's happening! It's totally happening.
Leslie Knope,Our kids are falling in love.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Good call.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,"I've been so busy catching up with everyone, I haven't had a chance to ask them."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's what I think."
Leslie Knope,I hate when we're on opposite sides.
Leslie Knope,It stinks.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, if one of us runs, it doesn't mean we're going to win."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Which is why I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,I think we should flip a coin.
Leslie Knope,I mean it.
Leslie Knope,Let's literally flip a coin.
Leslie Knope,Because whoever runs is going to do a great job.
Leslie Knope,"And whoever doesn't run is going to be right alongside the other one, offering advice and support and whatever they need."
Leslie Knope,"So, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,So let's flip a coin.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Because whatever's next, you and I are in it together."
Leslie Knope,"So, let's go tell everybody."
Leslie Knope,"And they can participate and they can sign the coin and then, you know, the coin will eventually make its way into the Smithsonian."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, gather around! First of all, I just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same time with your children here, it's like It's the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of America."
Leslie Knope,"And secondly, Ben and I have an announcement."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm running for governor."
Leslie Knope,"Ben is going to be running my campaign, because he's a super genius and he's got a tight, compact little body like an Italian sports car."
Leslie Knope,"But right now, I'd like to make a toast."
Leslie Knope,"When we worked here, together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people's lives a tiny bit better."
Leslie Knope,That's what public service is all about.
Leslie Knope,"Small, incremental change, every day."
Leslie Knope,"Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."""
Leslie Knope,And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.
Leslie Knope,"I started my career more than 30 years ago, in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"I've had a lot of different jobs, including two terms as your governor."
Leslie Knope,"And soon, a new, unknown challenge awaits me."
Leslie Knope,"Which, to me, even now, is thrilling, because I love the work."
Leslie Knope,Not to say that public service isn't sexy.
Leslie Knope,Because it definitely is.
Leslie Knope,But that's not why we do it.
Leslie Knope,"We do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing, alongside a team of people who we love."
Leslie Knope,"So, I thank those people who have walked with me, and I thank you for this honor."
Leslie Knope,"Now, go find your team, and get to work."
Leslie Knope,A [bleep] library?
Leslie Knope,"Well, there you have it, sir."
Leslie Knope,Another problem solved by the hard work of dedicated public servants.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's about right."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,Good idea! Garry had a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I'm ready.
Leslie Knope,Greg Pikitis.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's right."
Leslie Knope,I'm the Parks lady.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,And I'm here to tell you that this year it ends.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, this kid makes me crazy."
Leslie Knope,"We got a history, Greg and I."
Leslie Knope,He absolutely terrorizes the Parks system.
Leslie Knope,Every Halloween someone defaces the statue of Mayor Percy in Ramsett Park.
Leslie Knope,"And I know it's Greg Pikitis, but I've never been able to prove it."
Leslie Knope,"He's like an invisible, adolescent, James Bond super villain criminal mastermind."
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe someone else is doing it, but I really feel like it's this kid."
Leslie Knope,"I've got the entire Parks Department watching you, my boyfriend's a cop, so don't even try it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I think you do."
Leslie Knope,"It ends today, Pikitis."
Leslie Knope,It ends.
Leslie Knope,Today.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Ends today.
Leslie Knope,Check this out.
Leslie Knope,These are all the possible routes from Greg Pikitis' house to the statue.
Leslie Knope,"In a way, that's a compliment."
Leslie Knope,Shows dedication.
Leslie Knope,And all the trees and all the benches.
Leslie Knope,"It takes us, like, 10 days to clean his mess up."
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, Greg Pikitis sucks, and I wanna destroy him."
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,Relax.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, William Percy."
Leslie Knope,One of Pawnee's greatest mayors.
Leslie Knope,And a true hero.
Leslie Knope,"During the Pawnee Bread Factory fire of 1922, he ran back into a burning building and saved the beloved secret recipe for Pawnee Pumpernickel."
Leslie Knope,He wasn't Superman.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's based on William Percy.
Leslie Knope,Were you listening to what I just said?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Good news.
Leslie Knope,You're officially on the Parks Department payroll.
Leslie Knope,8 dollars an hour.
Leslie Knope,Commit this to memory.
Leslie Knope,"You see him, you stop him."
Leslie Knope,Knock his head off if you have to.
Leslie Knope,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,But I give you permission to use excessive force.
Leslie Knope,Don't go overboard.
Leslie Knope,Just stop him.
Leslie Knope,By any means necessary.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Just stop him.
Leslie Knope,You know what I mean?
Leslie Knope,"8:22 p.m, suspect still with friends in parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"He looks obnoxious and irritating, even from a great distance."
Leslie Knope,"Suspect laughing with friends and playing with his stupid skateboard in a snide, turdish manner."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Like a turd.
Leslie Knope,Like a little turd.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, let's go."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We'll go by my office and pick up my costume.
Leslie Knope,Can't we just fire a warning shot over his head as we drive by?
Leslie Knope,Leaving location.
Leslie Knope,Look at stupid suspect.
Leslie Knope,I hate suspect.
Leslie Knope,Where are my keys?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Pikitis!
Leslie Knope,It was Pikitis.
Leslie Knope,Believe me now?
Leslie Knope,This is a peach pit.
Leslie Knope,He was eating a peach when I went to go talk to him.
Leslie Knope,This is his ace of spades.
Leslie Knope,This is his calling card.
Leslie Knope,This is what he leaves all his victims.
Leslie Knope,And it's still warm.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, go and arrest him."
Leslie Knope,And send this to the lab.
Leslie Knope,You talk to him first.
Leslie Knope,You have a scary face.
Leslie Knope,"No, in a good way."
Leslie Knope,Scary cute.
Leslie Knope,Go talk to him.
Leslie Knope,Ask him about the peach pit.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,In the conference room.
Leslie Knope,Trying to hide his obvious guilt.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he did."
Leslie Knope,And we need a confession.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Andy and I are going to take a walk.
Leslie Knope,"And it's gonna be just you, Pikitis, and these pliers."
Leslie Knope,Nobody said torture.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He's never seen you before.
Leslie Knope,So imply that you're someone very important and that you can make his life hell.
Leslie Knope,Looks like Andy's wearing him down.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go finish him off.
Leslie Knope,What's going on in here?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, out."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,The gloves are coming off.
Leslie Knope,I think you know what that is.
Leslie Knope,"When I came to visit you at the school, you were eating a peach."
Leslie Knope,"Then my office gets vandalized, and somebody leaves a peach pit on my desk?"
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a coincidence, Greg."
Leslie Knope,I know you did this.
Leslie Knope,I don't care what you say.
Leslie Knope,I don't care that you were in the parking lot all night.
Leslie Knope,Somehow you found a way to get in here--
Leslie Knope,"Because I followed you, genius!"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have been very civil."
Leslie Knope,But I will waterboard you.
Leslie Knope,His mom's gonna be here soon.
Leslie Knope,"Please, Dave, just arrest him."
Leslie Knope,Just handcuff him to something.
Leslie Knope,Mrs. Pikitis?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, this is Officer Sanderson."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Two words, peach pit."
Leslie Knope,"His DNA is all over it, I assume."
Leslie Knope,We can get it tested.
Leslie Knope,"And if it matches your DNA, then you're going away for a long time."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Let them think they've lost us.
Leslie Knope,Then we're--
Leslie Knope,Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,Why would anyone do this?
Leslie Knope,I didn't.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why don't you go home?"
Leslie Knope,I'll finish cleaning this up.
Leslie Knope,"Huh, maybe Greg is innocent."
Leslie Knope,"If that's the case, then there's another kid out there who's tormenting me."
Leslie Knope,I believe that you're innocent until proven guilty in this country.
Leslie Knope,That's the cornerstone of democracy.
Leslie Knope,"On the other hand, Greg Pikitis is a little punk."
Leslie Knope,And I kind of wanna TP his house.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait! This is fun! This is fun! What do I do?"
Leslie Knope,This is for Mayor Percy! This is for the Parks Department office! This is for pooping on the handball court!
Leslie Knope,Yeah! This is really fun! But I don't condone it!
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, I think we have the wrong house."
Leslie Knope,"It's really hard to explain, but we were trying to get revenge on this kid, Greg Pikitis, and we thought this was his house, but I guess we got the address wrong."
Leslie Knope,You are?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I knew it!
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Make sure you--
Leslie Knope,Let them go! Stay on the leader!
Leslie Knope,How did you get into the Parks Department? I have to know.
Leslie Knope,Hey! You're going to jail for a very long time.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll let the jury decide."
Leslie Knope,Then the judge will decide where he goes.
Leslie Knope,"Dave, just let me have this."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"But the thing that's driving me nuts is, how did he do it?"
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we were here all afternoon."
Leslie Knope,"How did he get in? First of all, we always lock the doors when we leave."
Leslie Knope,And Dave and I tailed Pikitis from the moment he left his house at 7:00 p.m. to the moment we came back here.
Leslie Knope,"Does he have a lookalike or something? Did he have an accomplice? I mean, did he have help? How did that little turd do it?"
Leslie Knope,This truly is a day of mixed emotions for me.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sad that Old Gus is leaving, but it allows me to help Andy restart his life as Pioneer Hall's new shoeshine guy."
Leslie Knope,"So, I propose that we change our name from the Subcommittee for Pit Beautification to the Subcommittee for Lot Beautification."
Leslie Knope,"April, stop that."
Leslie Knope,Who are you texting?
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,She's texting me.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry you're bored.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge."
Leslie Knope,Keep the momentum going.
Leslie Knope,Keep these minds working.
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,The library?
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee's library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I've ever seen."
Leslie Knope,"They're like a biker gang, but instead of shotguns and crystal meth, they use political savvy and shushing."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for pulling me out of there.
Leslie Knope,"I need a good plan, though."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't wanna cause a panic."
Leslie Knope,"News flash, we're screwed."
Leslie Knope,We got a big problem with the library.
Leslie Knope,The library is the worst group of people ever assembled in history.
Leslie Knope,"They're mean, conniving, rude, and extremely well read, which makes them very dangerous."
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to steal Lot 48 for a new branch.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Jerks.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We need to make contact with someone there.
Leslie Knope,Does anybody know anybody that works at the library?
Leslie Knope,Ron's ex-wife?
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.
Leslie Knope,Or is that awful?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he hates her, but he knows her."
Leslie Knope,Everything's okay.
Leslie Knope,Or is it just the same?
Leslie Knope,Am I?
Leslie Knope,I am.
Leslie Knope,I have to go talk to her.
Leslie Knope,And you got to give me something I can use.
Leslie Knope,Does she have any weaknesses?
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, no?"
Leslie Knope,Everybody has a weakness.
Leslie Knope,I see.
Leslie Knope,"I knew that you had two ex-wives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one that you got along with and--"
Leslie Knope,I'm just looking forward to a thoughtful debate with Tammy about the relative merits of parks versus libraries.
Leslie Knope,"And in case something bad goes down, I wore my sharpest rings."
Leslie Knope,This one will tear you up.
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I called a little while ago.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,That is so typical.
Leslie Knope,"I should have known you'd use a low blow, dirty pool BS move like that."
Leslie Knope,That's why everybody hates the library.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,Here's your 3 dollars.
Leslie Knope,And I'll see you in hell.
Leslie Knope,I know this is a trap.
Leslie Knope,But I don't know how.
Leslie Knope,"I want it to be a perfect park with a state-of-the-art swing set, and basketball courts, and off to the side, a lovely sitting area for kids with asthma to watch other kids play."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the goal, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Government gals.
Leslie Knope,"She's changed, Ron."
Leslie Knope,She's a different person.
Leslie Knope,I think it would be healthy for you to get a sense of closure.
Leslie Knope,Look at Mark and me.
Leslie Knope,We slept together.
Leslie Knope,"We talked about it, we're still friends."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Good start.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I got two people to put aside years of hostility and open a door to the possibility of friendship.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I think Ron was acting like a baby, a little bit."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what is he afraid of?"
Leslie Knope,Tammy's just a woman.
Leslie Knope,A nice woman.
Leslie Knope,"You know, she's not a murderer."
Leslie Knope,She's not a dragon.
Leslie Knope,"When you meddle in someone's personal life, it's just so rewarding."
Leslie Knope,"So, how did your coffee with Tammy go?"
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,So what did you guys talk about?
Leslie Knope,Old times?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I love talking about old times."
Leslie Knope,"New times are great, too, but there's just something about old times, you know what I mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, spare me the details."
Leslie Knope,I'm just happy.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"This seems like a private matter, but I'm so--"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm happy that it went well and that you enjoyed your coffee."
Leslie Knope,I truly believe that everyone should be friends with their exes.
Leslie Knope,I can't even tell you how many of my exes' weddings I've been to.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm too classy to say ""I told you so,"" Donna."
Leslie Knope,So I wrote it on a Post-it.
Leslie Knope,I care.
Leslie Knope,I care a lot.
Leslie Knope,"It's kind of my thing, remember?"
Leslie Knope,Or a library.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, have you been talking to Tammy about the lot?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, tell me the truth."
Leslie Knope,Are you giving her the lot?
Leslie Knope,For what?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, can I speak with you for a second?"
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You don't care about Ron.
Leslie Knope,You're just using him to get Lot 48 for your library.
Leslie Knope,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,What kind of lunatic would wanna be Cleopatra over Eleanor Roosevelt?
Leslie Knope,I would never work at the Library Department.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna tell Ron what you just said, and this little game that you're playing is gonna be over."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you better run."
Leslie Knope,We're no longer government gals.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we need to talk."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, no."
Leslie Knope,The Planning Department Reprioritization Document?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, you're going to."
Leslie Knope,"Because Tammy wants you to, and you do everything that she wants."
Leslie Knope,Are you even listening to yourself?
Leslie Knope,You're defending the library now?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, the library?"
Leslie Knope,"Of all the horrifying, miserable things in the world?"
Leslie Knope,I can't even believe what I'm hearing.
Leslie Knope,"""Some people like libraries."""
Leslie Knope,"Ron, she's in your head."
Leslie Knope,"You said that she was a manipulative monster, and you were right."
Leslie Knope,Look me in the eye and tell me that she's changed.
Leslie Knope,Look me in the eye.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you just break up with her?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Ron, I don't wanna hear about your disgusting sex anymore."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Now sack up.
Leslie Knope,You are Ron freaking Swanson.
Leslie Knope,I don't think I should get involved in this.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I would never use those words.
Leslie Knope,I never said-- Point taken.
Leslie Knope,Let's go dump your ex.
Leslie Knope,"So, would you like to be in the room when I tell her it's over, or would you rather wait outside?"
Leslie Knope,Here are the ground rules.
Leslie Knope,Don't talk to her.
Leslie Knope,Do not make eye contact with her.
Leslie Knope,Don't believe anything she says.
Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, like a potted plant."
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tammy, for that and many other reasons, Ron has decided to end this relationship."
Leslie Knope,"No, he doesn't."
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,He's completely over you.
Leslie Knope,"God, Ron, you have to."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I had one dream."
Leslie Knope,"But no, no."
Leslie Knope,"I'm here because Ron is my friend, and I don't like seeing my friends miserable."
Leslie Knope,"And you, Tammy, you make him miserable."
Leslie Knope,"So, Ron, you can give her the lot, or don't, whatever."
Leslie Knope,"Just, please, find a way to be happy."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,Just sign the thing.
Leslie Knope,I'm sure that's not true.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You didn't give her the lot.
Leslie Knope,Is part of your mustache missing?
Leslie Knope,There's a push-pin in your face.
Leslie Knope,My legs are shorter than yours.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for saving my future park.
Leslie Knope,I know that must've been hard for you.
Leslie Knope,"You didn't kill Tammy, did you?"
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You can do better than that.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Leslie Knope,She works for the library.
Leslie Knope,What was it this time?
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,That's new.
Leslie Knope,The mural that normally resides here is called The Spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And it's very controversial.
Leslie Knope,"We've had someone throw acid at it, tomato sauce."
Leslie Knope,Someone tried to stab it once.
Leslie Knope,We really need better security here.
Leslie Knope,"We also need better, less offensive history."
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you work in Sewage."
Leslie Knope,Your department literally specializes in crap.
Leslie Knope,You really want to do this?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this department has the chance to design something that could be in this building forever."
Leslie Knope,This could be our legacy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can have two legacies."
Leslie Knope,Look at Madonna.
Leslie Knope,"Great singer, amazing arms."
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's not true, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I've seen your fingernails.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, shoot."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm ordering all of you to design a mural."
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Order them to do this.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, here are your supplies."
Leslie Knope,I want you to go and find the spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And make me a sketch.
Leslie Knope,And it needs to be breath-taking and moving and historical and better than every department.
Leslie Knope,And you have one hour.
Leslie Knope,Designers.
Leslie Knope,Make it work.
Leslie Knope,Tim Gunn.
Leslie Knope,I know everything about this town and these murals.
Leslie Knope,And that's why this is a dream come true.
Leslie Knope,Literally.
Leslie Knope,I have had a dream where I designed a mural.
Leslie Knope,"But then it turned into a nightmare, because the mural started talking, and it came alive and it was whispering."
Leslie Knope,"And I couldn't hear what it was saying, so I leaned in close, and then it ate me."
Leslie Knope,"At one point, Gina Gershon was there."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Let's get going with the spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go first."
Leslie Knope,I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at.
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,Who's the Jesus?
Leslie Knope,I didn't know he was from Indiana.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the best choice for Jesus?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he was great on ER."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he was."
Leslie Knope,Who am I thinking of?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Next?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Really good, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Disqualified!
Leslie Knope,I have one question.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I don't think they really got the assignment.
Leslie Knope,"If we're gonna beat all the other departments, we have to choose something that will stand the test of time."
Leslie Knope,Like the Mona Lisa.
Leslie Knope,Or the music of Squeeze.
Leslie Knope,"June 8, 1922."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Bread Factory burned to the ground.
Leslie Knope,We lost a lot of good bread that day.
Leslie Knope,As well as several human lives.
Leslie Knope,And it also made the whole town smell like toast.
Leslie Knope,"Which one resident described as ""disturbingly enticing."""
Leslie Knope,But I digress.
Leslie Knope,The point is we rebuilt Pawnee to the wonderful town that it is today.
Leslie Knope,"Well, because it's the most famous event in our town's history."
Leslie Knope,And people love voting for tragedy.
Leslie Knope,Look at the Oscars.
Leslie Knope,This is our Holocaust movie.
Leslie Knope,"This is our ""English Patient."""
Leslie Knope,"See, Ann gets it."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Time to vote, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Cast your votes.
Leslie Knope,"May the best, most tragic project win."
Leslie Knope,"When we started this, we were six different voices with six ideas for a mural."
Leslie Knope,And then those six voices came together as a team.
Leslie Knope,There are no losers today.
Leslie Knope,"But there is one winner, us."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, the results of the vote, please."
Leslie Knope,"We all voted for ourselves, didn't we?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We need to whittle these down.
Leslie Knope,Can we all agree on eliminating any of these designs?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you both have a point."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, yours was a little trite."
Leslie Knope,"And April, yours was hellish and might make someone vomit."
Leslie Knope,"He likes the shapes, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And he's part of the team.
Leslie Knope,"So, here."
Leslie Knope,Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.
Leslie Knope,And then we'll put them on a new team mural.
Leslie Knope,We're going to make a new design that takes the best parts of all of our designs.
Leslie Knope,It's like if you got Michelangelo and Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis from Garfield to do one painting.
Leslie Knope,Imagine how good that painting would be.
Leslie Knope,I think it's really good.
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.
Leslie Knope,Brendanawicz!
Leslie Knope,We need you for something.
Leslie Knope,Ann's in trouble.
Leslie Knope,We think it might be pills.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.
Leslie Knope,But this is just as important.
Leslie Knope,We need you to look at a piece of art.
Leslie Knope,This is our entry for the mural contest.
Leslie Knope,"We couldn't decide on one design, so we took parts that we all liked of our designs, and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing."
Leslie Knope,You have to save us.
Leslie Knope,You have to design something.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you sketch things.
Leslie Knope,That everybody stops and looks at.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Mark."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,You're the only one of us who's actually got any talent.
Leslie Knope,I know you'll do something good.
Leslie Knope,"And I really, really want to win this."
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,What are you going to do tonight?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,"No, guys."
Leslie Knope,This is the one.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Mark's right.
Leslie Knope,We have a reason.
Leslie Knope,We're going to win.
Leslie Knope,That's our reason.
Leslie Knope,Our designs are not going to win.
Leslie Knope,Mark's might win.
Leslie Knope,"How great would it be if we won, you guys?"
Leslie Knope,"You'll feel a lot better, I promise you, after you win."
Leslie Knope,We're going with this one.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the presentation tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"That is an order, team."
Leslie Knope,Go team!
Leslie Knope,Team dismissed.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are a team."
Leslie Knope,But I am the team leader.
Leslie Knope,"So, I made a bold decision."
Leslie Knope,We're playing it safe.
Leslie Knope,Better than life in the Sewage Defartment.
Leslie Knope,Which makes more sense.
Leslie Knope,That was pretty good.
Leslie Knope,You think they're going to win?
Leslie Knope,No point of view.
Leslie Knope,Smart.
Leslie Knope,Chief Konner.
Leslie Knope,What do you got there?
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Well, good luck."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I want my team back.
Leslie Knope,"And my team made this hot, crazy camel mess."
Leslie Knope,"So, this is what we're going to submit."
Leslie Knope,Even if it means we lose.
Leslie Knope,"God, I hope we win."
Leslie Knope,But we're definitely going to lose.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Let's get in there and show them how Parks gets it done.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Jesus Greg Kinnear.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, that's because he's moonwalking."
Leslie Knope,"So, he should be going the other way."
Leslie Knope,That did not occur to me.
Leslie Knope,"So, there you go."
Leslie Knope,The Spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We didn't win.
Leslie Knope,But neither did anyone else.
Leslie Knope,They realized it was going to cost a ton of money to hire a muralist.
Leslie Knope,"So, they're just going to restore the old one."
Leslie Knope,"They're changing the title to ""The Diversity Express."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well."
Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Did you get my proposal for the possible rezoning of Lot 48?
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,But I think it would be a really great thing for the neighborhood.
Leslie Knope,And I completely understand that.
Leslie Knope,"But you and I both know that if we wanna find the money, we can."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'll walk with you."
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, when we allocate money for parks"
Leslie Knope,The only trails he's gonna be surveying are trails of lies and deception.
Leslie Knope,Ron has a special deal with the park rangers.
Leslie Knope,"Every November, they let him use their cabin so he can go on a secret hunting trip with all the guys in the office."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, all the men."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, let's cut the bull."
Leslie Knope,"I want me, Tom and all the other ladies included on your hunting trip."
Leslie Knope,You're literally listening to turkey calls.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I am really good at hunting and I'm even better at being one of the guys.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so fun!
Leslie Knope,I'll bring S'mores.
Leslie Knope,April!
Leslie Knope,I need you to do something for me.
Leslie Knope,"I'm going hunting tomorrow, so call the State Parks Office and get verbal confirmation that our budget documentation is in."
Leslie Knope,Can I just tell you the 16 digit tracking number or do you want me to write it down?
Leslie Knope,I'll write it down.
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, try, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"And if you do it, I will name the first turkey I shoot after you."
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Ready to bag some birds?
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you change your mind, you're now officially a licensed Indiana hunter."
Leslie Knope,"All right, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,There he is.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I am the Pants Queen.
Leslie Knope,Bow to the Pants Queen.
Leslie Knope,"When you're out with the boys, you gotta be ready for a good pantsing."
Leslie Knope,That's why I have suspenders that connect my bra to my jeans.
Leslie Knope,Let me get some of that.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I'm full of surprises, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Why they call it chew and not swallow.
Leslie Knope,"Am I right, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"All right, safety basics!"
Leslie Knope,"Donna, can you tell me why it's bad to look down the barrel of your gun?"
Leslie Knope,"No, Donna, don't!"
Leslie Knope,Please!
Leslie Knope,And to the hunters!
Leslie Knope,The only way to defeat the beast is to find the beast within.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I was thinking maybe we could do mixed doubles, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Boy girl, boy girl."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, I always forget because you're so pretty, you're not used to rejection."
Leslie Knope,I have to hunt with Ron.
Leslie Knope,Perfect!
Leslie Knope,"All right, I hope you're ready to discuss some college bowl game scenarios!"
Leslie Knope,Now here's the female adolescent turkey.
Leslie Knope,Could you hear the difference?
Leslie Knope,Turkeys can.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, cool!"
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola--"
Leslie Knope,"Look, Ron, I know this weekend, you were looking forward to a lot of man on man on man action, but I just wanted to say I'm very grateful that you let me come along on this trip."
Leslie Knope,I saw a quail.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, man, you snooze, you lose."
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Leslie Knope,I think this is gonna be a really good bonding sesh for me and Ron.
Leslie Knope,Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love.
Leslie Knope,You're surprised that my breasts didn't throw my aim off?
Leslie Knope,It seems like you like to go hunting with the same people 'cause you know you can beat them.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you do!"
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,Just one of the guys.
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola, boola."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I got your hat!"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have your hat!"
Leslie Knope,Are you in a lot of pain?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, we called 911 and they're gonna send a ranger."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's here.
Leslie Knope,"Here's your Scotch, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"There we go, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you know what is great?"
Leslie Knope,Ann's gonna take care of you.
Leslie Knope,And Ann is the best nurse in North America.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,You okay?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"There was a bird kind of near me, and I know how desperate you were to prove yourself."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, I swear, I didn't."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I swear to God, I've never shot anyone."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,How are you feeling?
Leslie Knope,Are you dizzy or--
Leslie Knope,Is that normal?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry we have to do this!
Leslie Knope,This is for your own good.
Leslie Knope,Open your mouth!
Leslie Knope,Open your mouth!
Leslie Knope,Just-- Open your mouth!
Leslie Knope,"Well, good news is Ron is resting comfortably."
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,Although I am hoping that he has some memory loss.
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's very curious about who shot him."
Leslie Knope,"So, if you did it, just say, ""I did it."""
Leslie Knope,"Come on, person who shot Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I think it's a little weird that nobody wants to admit that they shot Ron in the head."
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, he has seemed really depressed lately."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,He loves the back of his head.
Leslie Knope,He would never shoot himself there.
Leslie Knope,That was pine trees.
Leslie Knope,Whoa! Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,How is he?
Leslie Knope,Good stuff?
Leslie Knope,Terribly.
Leslie Knope,No one will admit they shot Ron.
Leslie Knope,And no one saw it happen.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Leslie Knope,I am.
Leslie Knope,I shot Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,What? No! No!
Leslie Knope,November.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,I know what I'm doing.
Leslie Knope,Just go look after Ron.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm an excellent hunter.
Leslie Knope,Fair enough.
Leslie Knope,I was walking in the woods and then I tripped and my gun went off.
Leslie Knope,"No, I always have the safety on."
Leslie Knope,"I'm... While I was tripping, I saw a quail and I shot at it."
Leslie Knope,"No, that's-- Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,I got that tunnel vision that girls get.
Leslie Knope,And that's what happened.
Leslie Knope,End of story.
Leslie Knope,I let my emotions get the best of me.
Leslie Knope,"I just I would I cared too much, I guess."
Leslie Knope,I was thinking with my lady parts.
Leslie Knope,I was walking and I felt something icky.
Leslie Knope,I thought there was gonna be chocolate.
Leslie Knope,I don't even remember.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wearing a new bra and it closes in the front, so it popped open and it threw me off."
Leslie Knope,"All I wanna do is have babies! Are you single? I'm just, like, going through a thing right now."
Leslie Knope,I guess when my life is incomplete I wanna shoot someone.
Leslie Knope,This would not happen if I had a penis.
Leslie Knope,What? Bitches be crazy.
Leslie Knope,I'm good at tolerating pain.
Leslie Knope,I'm bad at math.
Leslie Knope,And I'm stupid.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm really sorry that I ruined your weekend."
Leslie Knope,"Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you Sure."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, you know, I couldn't let--"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Pants Queen!
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to go to the fourth floor.
Leslie Knope,That is the creepiest place on Earth.
Leslie Knope,The fourth floor is awful.
Leslie Knope,"The DMV, divorce filings, probation offices."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"They put a popcorn machine up there just to brighten things up, but they used the wrong kind of oil, and a bunch of people had to get their throats replaced."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Thank you, sir."
Leslie Knope,"I'm good, thank you."
Leslie Knope,Tom and Wendy?
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, how's everything in your life, generally?"
Leslie Knope,Uh-huh.
Leslie Knope,"And how are your institutions, that you're a part of?"
Leslie Knope,I saw you on the fourth floor.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so, so sorry."
Leslie Knope,I don't know what those are.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Tom, stop working."
Leslie Knope,You should've autosaved that.
Leslie Knope,That kind of feels like your fault.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I've heard your voice when she calls you on the phone."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you look at her ass when she leaves the room.
Leslie Knope,You love her.
Leslie Knope,"I did a little research, and divorce is the number two most stressful event in a person's life."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, marriage is number seven."
Leslie Knope,"So, watch out, everyone."
Leslie Knope,It's all bad.
Leslie Knope,"We have to step up, for Tom's sake."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is the problem."
Leslie Knope,"Tom always seems like Mr. Slickster Cool Guy, but he's actually hiding his emotions underneath a very thick layer of Axe body spray."
Leslie Knope,We have to help him.
Leslie Knope,We are his safe bubble.
Leslie Knope,"Be supportive, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Don't be all, like, ""No, I don't want to."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am a guy and I like fire and playing hockey and eating meat!"""
Leslie Knope,"""No, no, says I!"""
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry you feel that way, little friend."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we go out tonight, hit the town after work, huh?"
Leslie Knope,We'll make it Tom's night.
Leslie Knope,"You can go anywhere you want, our treat."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I know there's a really fun documentary about tandem bicycles at the art house."
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be pretty unapologetic.
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to a restaurant--
Leslie Knope,Noâ¦
Leslie Knope,You did.
Leslie Knope,You just did.
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a good idea, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Dinosaurs, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"It's gonna be a crazy night, guys!"
Leslie Knope,I will see you at Jurassic Fork at 5:45 p.m.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna get the Tricera-chops, please."
Leslie Knope,Medium roar.
Leslie Knope,"No, medium roar."
Leslie Knope,Here's what I think we should do.
Leslie Knope,Everyone should go around and say one thing that they love about Tom.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was weird, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go ahead."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,The restaurant will just divide it evenly.
Leslie Knope,Just enjoy yourself.
Leslie Knope,"April, go ahead."
Leslie Knope,Ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,"I thought I had Tom all figured out, but it's almost like he's faking being sad."
Leslie Knope,Why would he do that?
Leslie Knope,"So, how you doing, buddy?"
Leslie Knope,Want some steak?
Leslie Knope,Champagne?
Leslie Knope,Think of something extravagant and we'll get it for you.
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,A cheese fountain?
Leslie Knope,A ruby?
Leslie Knope,A goose heart?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you guys just need some time apart, you know, to remember how much you care about each other."
Leslie Knope,You're a club promoter?
Leslie Knope,"Now, the sadness is pouring out of Tom, like blood from a pterodactyl after it's attacked by a T-Rex."
Leslie Knope,I have to take him to a place where he can't possibly be sad.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, crap."
Leslie Knope,We are going to the Glitter Factory.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take April home.
Leslie Knope,"Well, drop out of school and start doing meth."
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"I'm a feminist, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I would never, ever go to a strip club."
Leslie Knope,"I've gone on record that if I had to have a stripper's name, it would be ""Equality."""
Leslie Knope,But I'm willing to sacrifice all that I've worked for just to put a smile on your perverted little face.
Leslie Knope,So don't blow this.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Lap dances are on me.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm paying for them."
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna actually be on me.
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like Jane Goodall studying the chimps, you know?"
Leslie Knope,'Cause there are some feminist scholars who say that stripping is a feminist act.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, go put these in places I do not approve of."
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,It is rough in here.
Leslie Knope,Is it always like this?
Leslie Knope,"You're one of the good ones, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"All right, Tom!"
Leslie Knope,This is Seabiscuit.
Leslie Knope,Sierra.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,It's loud in here.
Leslie Knope,And I gave her money to writhe around on your parts.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I already paid her."
Leslie Knope,Can I get my money back?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let her do her writhing."
Leslie Knope,"I just gotta say, Sierra."
Leslie Knope,"I really don't get why this cheers men up, because it's very insincere and it's very fleeting."
Leslie Knope,"But go crazy, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Give my friend here the works.
Leslie Knope,Really grind the sorrow out of him.
Leslie Knope,"And then, afterwards, maybe reconsider your profession, but for now, grind away."
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Stripper dancing action!
Leslie Knope,"Is it because you have a strong, positive female figure watching you?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Seabiscuit."
Leslie Knope,That'll be all.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's perfectly normal to feel devastated when something's over."
Leslie Knope,It's exactly how I felt when that Planet Earth series ended.
Leslie Knope,What? Ron?
Leslie Knope,Swanson! Did you tell Tom that you were gonna ask out Wendy?
Leslie Knope,"What is wrong with you? I wish I wasn't alive to hear myself say this, but I am ashamed to be your deputy."
Leslie Knope,I don't get men.
Leslie Knope,"If they're not wagering their girlfriends in pool, then they're trying to steal each other's wives."
Leslie Knope,It makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,"Good, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Could you carry him out of here, please? And, you know, also maybe not have sex with his wife?"
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,From the knees.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Wendy."
Leslie Knope,"We took Tom out tonight, and he had a little bit too much to drink."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You insensitive little hussy.
Leslie Knope,You're not even divorced yet and you're inviting other men over?
Leslie Knope,"You know what, Wendy? You and Ron will be perfect for each other."
Leslie Knope,You two should get married and start a club for people who betray Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,You have a lovely home.
Leslie Knope,"So, how you feeling? Rough morning?"
Leslie Knope,"I know last night was really rough, but all I want for you is to be able to get over this."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, because you're a Libyan!"
Leslie Knope,Oh! Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Start again.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you like your wife?"
Leslie Knope,That's a bummer.
Leslie Knope,Does anyone else know that you like your wife? Does your wife know that you like your wife?
Leslie Knope,How could there possibly still be glitter on me?
Leslie Knope,"You are getting a rare glimpse at this exclusive, government only event."
Leslie Knope,"Each December, one department puts on a show that spoofs what happened in our town."
Leslie Knope,Prepare to laugh your Asnov!
Leslie Knope,Sid Asnov is a former city councilman.
Leslie Knope,Some of the jokes are sort of inside.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there is a new one, and it's a doozy."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to go into the details, but let me just say that it involves multiple women, a love child, nurses, rabbis, priests."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope you can all join me at my fundraiser tonight."
Leslie Knope,"I am being supported, of course, by the Glitter Factory and 1-800-Mattress."
Leslie Knope,Classic!
Leslie Knope,"Lot 48 was once a horrible and disgusting pit, and now it's the site of Pawnee's Winter Wonderland."
Leslie Knope,This could not be more perfect if I had planned it myself.
Leslie Knope,Which I did.
Leslie Knope,And it's awesome.
Leslie Knope,"So, let's talk skedge, guys."
Leslie Knope,"The kids are gonna come at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday, and everyone's gonna do Santa for two hours, so I would just advise everyone, before you get in your costume, to go to the bathroom, so we can avoid what happened last year."
Leslie Knope,"6:00 p.m., caroling with the youth choir, and I am proud to announce, for the first time ever this year, our tree lighting ceremony will be simulcast on Internet radio."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Any questions, direct them to me."
Leslie Knope,Dismissed.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,I'm not scared.
Leslie Knope,I got nothing to apologize for.
Leslie Knope,I could've been a lot harder on him.
Leslie Knope,He got off easy.
Leslie Knope,And often.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, I'll be here all week!"
Leslie Knope,Councilman Dexhart?
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,It's my pleasure.
Leslie Knope,I am assuming this is about my performance in the Government Follies last night.
Leslie Knope,"I'd just like to say that I have nothing to apologize for, except for perhaps being too incisive."
Leslie Knope,Who told me?
Leslie Knope,Nobody.
Leslie Knope,Nobody told me nothing!
Leslie Knope,What are we talking about?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I-- No one-- I haven't-- I haven't heard any of this, ever, in my whole life."
Leslie Knope,"Believe me, I would have remembered this."
Leslie Knope,It was fine.
Leslie Knope,Pretty straightforward.
Leslie Knope,Short meeting.
Leslie Knope,He's a busy guy.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,What the--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,All I did was write and perform in one amazing skit.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,How do I fight back?
Leslie Knope,Give me some options.
Leslie Knope,How would that help?
Leslie Knope,"April, I appreciate that, but I don't think it's something worth losing your virginity over."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,What have you heard?
Leslie Knope,"Well, keep your ear to the ground."
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let these people intimidate me.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do my job.
Leslie Knope,I would be lying if I said that I never thought I would be involved in an incident like this.
Leslie Knope,Except I always assumed that I would be the politician and the man would be accused of sleeping with me.
Leslie Knope,"And that man would be the vice president, and I would be the president."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look good."
Leslie Knope,"You need to put some tights on, though, and I want you to make sure you keep your neckline nice and high."
Leslie Knope,I'm not afraid to say anything.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I have nothing to hide.
Leslie Knope,"I'd never even met Councilman Dexhart before yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about the matter."
Leslie Knope,Who's saying that?
Leslie Knope,I can't!
Leslie Knope,I have too much work to do.
Leslie Knope,This department is not gonna deputy direct itself.
Leslie Knope,"I swear to you, I never even met the guy before last night."
Leslie Knope,You do?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's sweet."
Leslie Knope,Use your nightstick.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Where you going?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"I do, too."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,This whole Dexhart thing is not making me feel very attached to Pawnee right now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I know how to surf.
Leslie Knope,I took lessons when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,I'm actually pretty good.
Leslie Knope,Aw!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, for cripes sake!"
Leslie Knope,"In a 24 hour news cycle, the tiniest story gets dissected over and over again."
Leslie Knope,"In 2004, a kid from Pawnee went to the Olympics, and it was reported on for over a year."
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't even competing or anything, he just was going, literally, to watch the Olympics."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart, this has gone far enough."
Leslie Knope,I want you to hold a press conference and clear my name.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, with all due respect, get a grip."
Leslie Knope,"If you don't hold a press conference, I'm gonna come forward and tell the whole story."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Get out of here!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is Leslie Knope, and I would like Joan to clear all of her guests tomorrow, because I'm coming on the show."
Leslie Knope,"If you think that you can drag me and my friend through the mud, then you've got-- Yes, I'll hold."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be on your show."
Leslie Knope,I'm really happy that I have the chance to clear my name.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,She's not myâ¦
Leslie Knope,She's a--
Leslie Knope,You've got it wrong.
Leslie Knope,"Joan, I spoke with Councilman Dexhart for the first time that night."
Leslie Knope,"We met for about 15 minutes, and then I went home, alone, and that's the whole story."
Leslie Knope,I don't understand why I'm on trial here.
Leslie Knope,You should be grilling Councilman Dexhart.
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell me he was gonna be here?
Leslie Knope,"We do not have a private life! Stop saying that we have a private life! The fact is, we never slept together, and if we did, you would have proof, and we would have seen it by now."
Leslie Knope,What? That is a total lie.
Leslie Knope,You've never seen my butt.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,He has never seen my butt.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Here, Joan."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you look for yourself?
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it's come to this.
Leslie Knope,This is utterly humiliating.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,You know what? You're a class act.
Leslie Knope,I can't go to San Diego with you.
Leslie Knope,My life is here.
Leslie Knope,"My friends, my career."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"I really care about you, Dave."
Leslie Knope,I just-- I love this town.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,You want your ticket back?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God! Is something wrong with the tree?"
Leslie Knope,But it's almost 9:00.
Leslie Knope,It should've been lighted up an hour ago.
Leslie Knope,It's gotten a lot harder to work in government.
Leslie Knope,You think Winston Churchill ever had to pull his pants down and show his butt? No.
Leslie Knope,But would he have? Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Now, could he have? Well, maybe not towards the end of his life, but he would have."
Leslie Knope,Because he loved his job.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is Leslie Knope in the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,I know about this issue.
Leslie Knope,"I called the city attorney, like, 50 times."
Leslie Knope,He didn't call me back.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that'd be terrific."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,Salami on pumpernickel with olice juice and extra iceberg.
Leslie Knope,It was the only sandwich on the board that wasn't named.
Leslie Knope,I just wish I liked it.
Leslie Knope,"I really miss him. Yeah, I'm just trying to enjoy the memories."
Leslie Knope,"I know, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,"I asked the police department if I could have it, and they said no, so I stole it."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, it feels a little too soon."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, maybe."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, yeah, of course!"
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming in.
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,Is a friend of mine!
Leslie Knope,"That's my motto, too."
Leslie Knope,"So, what is your specialty?"
Leslie Knope,Is it locking up the bad guys or keeping them on the streets?
Leslie Knope,That's interesting.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, I love those commercials!"
Leslie Knope,"If you want to start a fire, But you have to do it fast--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,"This is my colleague, Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go into the conference room."
Leslie Knope,I've got everything laid out.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, stop."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I am."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, these green things represent trees."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,I know you're really busy.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,I've been thinking.
Leslie Knope,"It has been a while since Dave left, and I think I might be ready to start dating again."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I was only with Mark for one night, and then I was hung up on him for six years."
Leslie Knope,"I dated Dave for three months, so if I continue that pattern, I won't be over him for... Five hundred years."
Leslie Knope,He has the brains of George Clooney in the body of Joe Biden.
Leslie Knope,Actually I was thinkingâ¦
Leslie Knope,What about Justin?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I feel like we kind of hit it off in there."
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Is there something wrong with him?
Leslie Knope,What is it though?
Leslie Knope,I think it would. No?
Leslie Knope,"Don't be sorry, I mean, if you think it wasn't gonna work, orâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good, great, yes!"
Leslie Knope,"Go, Ann, go!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, just one rule."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to date a twin, 'cause I've been tricked before."
Leslie Knope,"No, I've been running around all day."
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,Is that his blood?
Leslie Knope,Who is he?
Leslie Knope,Thanks!
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,How's he gonna know it's me?
Leslie Knope,I'll wear a red rose in my hair.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'll wear a giant red hat."
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't have one of those."
Leslie Knope,What should I wear?
Leslie Knope,It's gotta be red.
Leslie Knope,Good call.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Are you Chris?
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"Well done, Ann."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Boo!
Leslie Knope,Indiana Hoosiers!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It's not important.
Leslie Knope,I'm just glad that we could make this happen.
Leslie Knope,"Well, she's my number one best friend."
Leslie Knope,"Actually, it's regular parks."
Leslie Knope,Like swings and slides and stuff.
Leslie Knope,"You know, isn't it funny how these setups are always just so awkward?"
Leslie Knope,I don'tâ¦ I don't know. They're not. Forget it.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, you didn't."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, you kind of did."
Leslie Knope,"Let's just start from the beginning, I guess."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So, do you enjoy it, being an MRI technician?"
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with her?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you look inside this bread, all you're gonna find is more bread."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Thisâ¦ it's just bread in there.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, it's good that you found your calling."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've never even had an MRI before."
Leslie Knope,I don't know about this.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am a little curious."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe someday we'll tell our grandkids how weird our first date was and how creepy their grandfather was.
Leslie Knope,Well hopefully there'll be nothing to diagnose.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Does that matter?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm from Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Yes she does.
Leslie Knope,Can I answer that?
Leslie Knope,All kinds.
Leslie Knope,"One time I was on my bike and some boys were making fun of me, so I chased them and I lost control."
Leslie Knope,I'm surprised you can see that.
Leslie Knope,"It was, like, three years ago."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, time to go."
Leslie Knope,"So we're done, right?"
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,We just finished the MRI.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there, but this guy is nuts."
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to offend you, you know? I know he's your friend."
Leslie Knope,Why would you think he'd be perfect for me then?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What's weird?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Is that bad?
Leslie Knope,Are you serious?
Leslie Knope,Should we go?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, actually, Chris, it was nice to meet you, but I think this is gonna be our last date."
Leslie Knope,This was your idea.
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,I drove us here.
Leslie Knope,Goodie.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the good news is I don't have cancer."
Leslie Knope,The bad news is I got an MRI bill for 2000 dollars.
Leslie Knope,I just don't understand why the hell Ann thought we'd be a good fit.
Leslie Knope,"What? Not sexually. God, what's wrong with you, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,"No, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Should weâ¦?
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,This is really good.
Leslie Knope,"""Cease and desist."""
Leslie Knope,"""Burden of proof."""
Leslie Knope,Very forceful language. I'm a little scared.
Leslie Knope,"""Frivolous."""
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Justin, I just... I can't thank you enough."
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,I would love... Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, I would like to hit that, but Ann's being a little weird about it."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,Hey! I was just calling you.
Leslie Knope,This is a prescription for Denise Dogan.
Leslie Knope,Porter's Grill at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,If this situation is weird or if you feel weird--
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Go get him.
Leslie Knope,"I'm back on the horse, and this horse is a lawyer, so I'm looking forward to riding him."
Leslie Knope,"No, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Ten months ago, she was an intern who could give a C- R- A- P about local government."
Leslie Knope,"Now, she's our newest employee."
Leslie Knope,To April!
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, come and celebrate!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, everybody, let's get back to work."
Leslie Knope,"Well, one of the funner things that we do here in Pawnee is the annual Easter egg hunt."
Leslie Knope,"Tom hides the eggs, and I have to say he did an exceptional job this year."
Leslie Knope,I've been searching for 25 minutes and I haven't found a single egg.
Leslie Knope,And I'm an adult.
Leslie Knope,Maybe Tom's trying to make this year a challenge.
Leslie Knope,"And if so, he's succeeding."
Leslie Knope,I don't think a single egg has been found yet.
Leslie Knope,Let's keep looking.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna find one.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to see my mom.
Leslie Knope,She's a big mucky-muck in the county school system.
Leslie Knope,She's my hero.
Leslie Knope,How do I explain her?
Leslie Knope,She's as respected as Mother Teresa.
Leslie Knope,"She's as powerful as Stalin, and she's as beautiful as Margaret Thatcher."
Leslie Knope,"Right, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Choosing in.
Leslie Knope,"Just here to gossip, gab, chat, stuff we do."
Leslie Knope,"But it looks like you're super busy, and I am super busy, so I shall bid you adieu."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,I just remembered something.
Leslie Knope,I have my own subcommittee now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm sure you've heard something about it.
Leslie Knope,People are talking about it.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we're having a town hall meeting tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. at the Smithfield Community Center."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm leading it."
Leslie Knope,It's no biggie.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it is."
Leslie Knope,It's a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,You know-- You want to come?
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,That's why I fake invited you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody's here."
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Metal.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Subcommittee members.
Leslie Knope,Are we prepared for tomorrow night?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, have you booked the hall yet?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, did you clear your schedule?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.
Leslie Knope,"I have a secret weapon, canvassing."
Leslie Knope,Nothing better than good old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning.
Leslie Knope,I'm not above using my expertise to change hearts and minds if the cause is just.
Leslie Knope,"When I was in sixth grade, I was voted Best Dressed by 87 votes."
Leslie Knope,And there were only 63 people in my class. Andy fell into that pit.
Leslie Knope,I fell into that pit.
Leslie Knope,How many more Pawnee citizens are gonna have to fall into that pit before we turn it into a park?
Leslie Knope,Zero.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,I've got some sunscreen for your beaks.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you probably won't need any."
Leslie Knope,Uhâ¦. And this is our canvassing guide.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be the script that we use when we speak with people.
Leslie Knope,Ann and I are a team.
Leslie Knope,You guys are a team.
Leslie Knope,"We have even sectors, you guys have odd sectors."
Leslie Knope,And we're gonna win.
Leslie Knope,Go!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, someone's in there."
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be fun.
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Are you pumped up?
Leslie Knope,Look humble.
Leslie Knope,But confident.
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,We are representatives from your local government.
Leslie Knope,May we speak with you for a moment about the Sullivan Street pit?
Leslie Knope,Excellent!
Leslie Knope,Positive response.
Leslie Knope,How would you feel if we turned that pit into a beautiful community park?
Leslie Knope,That's-- Go to section three.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we understand that people are busy, but we would love for you to come to the meeting and toâ¦"
Leslie Knope,She's gone.
Leslie Knope,How old are your kids?
Leslie Knope,Could the 4 year old watch the 2 year old?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Keep going, keep moving."
Leslie Knope,Nose to the grindstone.
Leslie Knope,No means yes.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm hot, too."
Leslie Knope,Let's blow on each other's faces.
Leslie Knope,Or we could drink some water.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I didn't want it to have to come to this, but, Ann, please open the sealed envelope that's in your binder."
Leslie Knope,This is a little something I learned from Karl Rove.
Leslie Knope,"If you want to guarantee the results of a survey, you design the question to give you the answer that you want."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, don't worry about it, I made it all up."
Leslie Knope,"Wouldn't you agree, like most decent Americans, that it would be a good idea to turn the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street into a beautiful community park?"
Leslie Knope,Would you change your mind if I told you that nine out of 10 meth users said the same exact thing?
Leslie Knope,Survey.
Leslie Knope,We surveyed crystal meth users.
Leslie Knope,You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park!
Leslie Knope,"It's-- What I mean is, kids love parks and you should, too."
Leslie Knope,I didn't--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's next month, forget about it."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,We got one.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for your time, sir."
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, he said some upsetting things."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a public servant."
Leslie Knope,I need to be accessible.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Game changer.
Leslie Knope,You just busted the game wide open.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,We need Andy.
Leslie Knope,He's our symbol.
Leslie Knope,We'll wheel him around the neighborhood to get sympathy.
Leslie Knope,He's a cute FDR.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a nurse's costume?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, put those on."
Leslie Knope,Don't-- Why do I want to build this park so bad?
Leslie Knope,Maybe because a pit filled with garbage isn't the best that we can do in America.
Leslie Knope,"You know, in Russia, they could pretend that pit was a park, bring their kids down there."
Leslie Knope,"""Hey, Vlad! Look at these rocks! Let's pretend they're potatoes!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Nikolai! Do you want to swim in the dirt?"""
Leslie Knope,But not here.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.
Leslie Knope,And it is my dream to build a park.
Leslie Knope,That I one day visit with my White House staff on my birthday.
Leslie Knope,"And they say, ""President Knope, this park is awesome."""
Leslie Knope,"""Now we understand why you are the first female President of the United States."""
Leslie Knope,"Canvassing was okay, but I think we're gonna have to postpone the town meeting."
Leslie Knope,Only for 1 to 90 days.
Leslie Knope,City manager?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I have to cancel this meeting.
Leslie Knope,Fast-track?
Leslie Knope,Did my name come up at all?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this meeting needs to be canceled."
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,I'll push anything through anything.
Leslie Knope,You know me.
Leslie Knope,I doubt it.
Leslie Knope,It's a very breathable fabric--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I am.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you in the audience."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, and if the questions start getting negative, I'm gonna call on you."
Leslie Knope,And I need you to sell the crap out of the park.
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
Leslie Knope,"Please, April!"
Leslie Knope,This is serious!
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
Leslie Knope,"Good girl, good girl, good ""probably."""
Leslie Knope,Good girl.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go."
Leslie Knope,"Line up, everybody."
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I can't do that.
Leslie Knope,That's illegal.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming out tonight.
Leslie Knope,This is our first town meeting about the proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan Street into a community park.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Now, there are many people that I spoke to who are passionately in support of this idea."
Leslie Knope,"None of them were able to make it tonight, unfortunately."
Leslie Knope,But they totally exist.
Leslie Knope,I did not make them up.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I see a question."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No questions right now.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I remember you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We are a little ahead of schedule, because we're holding this town hall meeting so soon, which I was warned about by Mark Brendanawicz, our city planner assigned to this project."
Leslie Knope,"Uh... So, what would he say?"
Leslie Knope,Here we are.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz knows the answer to every question.
Leslie Knope,He's amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak.
Leslie Knope,Certainly did not.
Leslie Knope,He's the man.
Leslie Knope,He's capable of anything.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,That is Andy Dwyer.
Leslie Knope,He is a local resident and he tragically fell in the pit.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a five-minute break, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Democracy's happening.
Leslie Knope,People are talking.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, at least they aren't apathetic, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Before we continue, I'd love to just give you a little history of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, when a young man by the name of Reverend Luther Howell came from Terre Haute on an ox."
Leslie Knope,"He planted his flag in the ground and was met soon after by an angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians, who, when seeing the whiteness of his skin, twisted him to death."
Leslie Knope,Flash forward to 1969.
Leslie Knope,Man walks on the moon.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is lousy with hippies--
Leslie Knope,Filibuster! Boom! They can't touch you if you talk forever.
Leslie Knope,"I can't speak of the future, but I will."
Leslie Knope,"The future of Pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis, where we will communicate on watches, and blink our feelings to each other, rather than use words."
Leslie Knope,"And now, I'd like to take a magical journey through a little something I like to call The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster."
Leslie Knope,"I have the floor! ""There once was a boy named Milo, who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but"""
Leslie Knope,"Well, you did already talk, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,And I would love to listen to someone else.
Leslie Knope,Someone I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top.
Leslie Knope,Could you tell us how you feel about this park? Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we will take a vote."
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I want everyone up, lined up behind that microphone, and I want to hear from all of you."
Leslie Knope,One by one.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,That concludes our meeting.
Leslie Knope,We're out of time.
Leslie Knope,It's 9 o' clock.
Leslie Knope,"But we will have many public forums in the future, and we hope to see you all there."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,It was tough.
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, that's Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,That's democracy.
Leslie Knope,There are a lot of people here that want this park.
Leslie Knope,You just gotta get past the negative people.
Leslie Knope,But guess what? My subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight.
Leslie Knope,"God, I loved it! I loved every minute of it."
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"Hear that? He called me ""park lady."""
Leslie Knope,"And it's because of you, our teachers, that every one of these recreation classes in this catalog shines like a jewel in Pawnee's beautiful crown."
Leslie Knope,"Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, this year we will have to remove five jewels from that crown."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"The city took away 1,000 dollars from our budget."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm very sorry."
Leslie Knope,By attendance and student evaluations.
Leslie Knope,"So, just make sure your students leave with a smile."
Leslie Knope,Hopefully your attendance is good!
Leslie Knope,"Actually, no, hopefully it's bad."
Leslie Knope,Nobody's more upset about this than me.
Leslie Knope,I've been taking these rec center classes since I was in high school.
Leslie Knope,"It's where I learned hair braiding, and how to make biscuits, and French kissing."
Leslie Knope,"The French kissing was just from a boy in my biscuits class, but either way, lesson learned."
Leslie Knope,I want to go!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I am on a date with Justin in Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,"We've only been out a few times, but every one of them has been amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Last time, we had a private tour and cocktails at the Indianapolis Aquarium."
Leslie Knope,That fish over there kind of reminds me of my mom.
Leslie Knope,It's just being really withholding.
Leslie Knope,Justin is definitely the most interesting guy I've ever dated.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Justin."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's really good!"
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is me.
Leslie Knope,"Excellent, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I'll plan something exciting.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, our date in Pawnee is gonna blow Indianapolis out of the water."
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,You better.
Leslie Knope,I've racked my brain and I can't come up with one exciting idea.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he once ate fried cockatoo with a member of the Thai Royal Family."
Leslie Knope,A dinner party!
Leslie Knope,That's genius.
Leslie Knope,"I'll invite all my most interesting friends over, we'll have this big rambling party."
Leslie Knope,"I know what you meant, but I took your idea and I made it better."
Leslie Knope,"It's called a think tank, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Our lunches.
Leslie Knope,Our lunches are like think tanks.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I want you to come over to my house at 2:00 and help me get ready."
Leslie Knope,And make sure that Mark is coming.
Leslie Knope,So much work to do!
Leslie Knope,You're my best friend.
Leslie Knope,"Now, get out of here!"
Leslie Knope,Three.
Leslie Knope,Four.
Leslie Knope,Not including dessert.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Now, it will be five courses."
Leslie Knope,Just be there at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Tom!"
Leslie Knope,I'm having an A list dinner party for Justin.
Leslie Knope,"And you, out of all my friends, come from the most distant and exotic land."
Leslie Knope,Save it for the party.
Leslie Knope,Can you make it?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Isn't that polish gonna get on people's butts when they sit down?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen."
Leslie Knope,I'm having a partyâ¦
Leslie Knope,And I thought maybe you could help me with serving and taking people's coats.
Leslie Knope,"I'd pay you, like, 10 bucks an hour."
Leslie Knope,Really fun people.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Tom, Mark and Ann."
Leslie Knope,Justin is coming into town.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to my house, for the very first time."
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,It's a little messy.
Leslie Knope,But I have a system.
Leslie Knope,"So, I just need you to help me put the finishing touches on everything."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, the first rumblings of Iran Contra!"
Leslie Knope,Don't throw that out!
Leslie Knope,I might need it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if two birds come along?"
Leslie Knope,"Andy's gonna come over soon, he can help us with all this stuff."
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, is this Maria Portlesman from ""Organize Your Life, with Maria Portlesman""?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God."
Leslie Knope,How much do I owe you?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I insist on paying."
Leslie Knope,This is not gonna affect my decision at all.
Leslie Knope,Stop winking.
Leslie Knope,Five courses.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"So, how's it looking?"
Leslie Knope,It smells great.
Leslie Knope,"Tania, like I said over the phone--"
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"Are you gonna be all right, tonight?"
Leslie Knope,That sounds very professional.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to my humble abode.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I have."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,No talking.
Leslie Knope,Everybody stop talking until Justin gets here.
Leslie Knope,Don't use up your stories.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What part of not talking do you not understand?
Leslie Knope,"Please, have a good time and shut your mouth."
Leslie Knope,I just want this dinner party to go well.
Leslie Knope,There are very few things I've asked for in this world.
Leslie Knope,To build a new park from scratch.
Leslie Knope,To eventually become president.
Leslie Knope,And to one day solve a murder on a train.
Leslie Knope,I think it's fair to add this to the list.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, Justin's here!"
Leslie Knope,That's Justin.
Leslie Knope,Everybody start talking.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to my very interesting party.
Leslie Knope,"I know, it's gonna be super fun."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a blast.
Leslie Knope,"Really, really, just like the best, most exciting night of your life."
Leslie Knope,I cannot overhype it enough.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"No, she doesn't."
Leslie Knope,The southern part's always the best part of anything.
Leslie Knope,"Oh I think, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,"Like, maybe the Yellow Pages."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, get over here!"
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, do you think this party's going well?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, can you see Justin?"
Leslie Knope,Is he having fun?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good."
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna casually make my--
Leslie Knope,Unreal!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's... Isn't it, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,Dinner is served!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Excellent!
Leslie Knope,"We agreed that we should invite interesting people for Justin, and Wendy is an interesting person!"
Leslie Knope,I've been telling you for weeks that you should tell her how you feel.
Leslie Knope,Now's your chance!
Leslie Knope,He'll get over it.
Leslie Knope,"This is something, Justin."
Leslie Knope,"Derek and Ben are gay, but often, on occasion, April will have relations with Derek."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Crazy stuff.
Leslie Knope,Discuss that.
Leslie Knope,Who else is gay?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need your help."
Leslie Knope,There was a lull.
Leslie Knope,I saw Justin yawn.
Leslie Knope,Please tell me that yawning is a sign of excitement in India or something.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, focus!"
Leslie Knope,"God, you're no help."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to be clear, this will in no way influence me."
Leslie Knope,It won't affect my decision.
Leslie Knope,And it has no bearing on the future of your class.
Leslie Knope,This sounds good.
Leslie Knope,I wonder who that is.
Leslie Knope,Who could that be?
Leslie Knope,A belly dancer?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"It's weird, but she just showed up."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not the kind of person that's gonna throw someone out, or, you know, not let them in if they randomly show up."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how they all got here.
Leslie Knope,"You know, people hear about a killer party at Knope's house, they all come running."
Leslie Knope,"You don't do origami every day, do ya?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Are you having fun?
Leslie Knope,There's not.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What course do you teach?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, guys, please."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, can you just stay? Okay? Justin, would you--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Just that I am looking forward to the truth coming out.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"If I may, Phil, I'd like to say something to Tom on the record."
Leslie Knope,I'm very sorry that I invited Wendy to the party.
Leslie Knope,And hopefully then-to-be future wife.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm really sorry."
Leslie Knope,I put a new romance in front of an old friendship.
Leslie Knope,I put a beautiful man in front of an adorable man child.
Leslie Knope,I put a big white stallion in front of a little brown pony.
Leslie Knope,That will become clear.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Anderson, could you please describe that evening?"
Leslie Knope,"Could you define pleasant? Did you have a good time? Did you have a great time? Be specific, and do remember that you're under oath."
Leslie Knope,But you fell asleep.
Leslie Knope,You should've told me.
Leslie Knope,I would've rescheduled.
Leslie Knope,No further questions.
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of official business, so I can't talk about it right now."
Leslie Knope,"But, yes, yes, you will."
Leslie Knope,"So, did you get that? He said amazing and awesome."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna drive up and see him next weekend."
Leslie Knope,There's some Kabuki theater festival happening.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did something wrong, and I felt bad."
Leslie Knope,"So, this morning I donated 1,000 dollars to the rec center, so everybody could keep teaching their classes."
Leslie Knope,"Are you kidding, Ann? It's every girl's dream to ask a dude how their date went under penalty of perjury."
Leslie Knope,I'm not proud of my actions.
Leslie Knope,"But the most important thing is, there is now an official government document that proves my dinner party kicked ass."
Leslie Knope,You look like Encyclopedia Brown.
Leslie Knope,"Well, as far as white, leather suits goâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Starting next month, Sweetums is gonna take over the concession stands in our parks."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't love the idea of corporate sponsorship, but Sweetums is an institution."
Leslie Knope,"When you think of Pawnee, you think of Sweetums."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that family looks so healthy."
Leslie Knope,Look at them.
Leslie Knope,They're all wearing vests!
Leslie Knope,Shoelace.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Your keys, please."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll let the chart be the judge of that."
Leslie Knope,"What are you, 5'11"", 210 pounds, three whiskeys?"
Leslie Knope,Looks like you are just over the line into impaired.
Leslie Knope,It comes in handy.
Leslie Knope,"And on the back, it teaches you how to play blackjack."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not gonna argue with you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"We're just gonna sit and wait until, you know, you're safe to drive, which would be in about one hour."
Leslie Knope,"""Insurance is a side bet when you wager half of your original bet because you believe the dealer has a 10 in the hole."""
Leslie Knope,Twenty minutes.
Leslie Knope,The dealer really has an advantage.
Leslie Knope,That's what I get the most from this.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,I watched a really good--
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Leslie Knope,Beautiful.
Leslie Knope,I feel like I'm in a spa.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, are you moving out?"
Leslie Knope,Have you told Wendy how you feel yet?
Leslie Knope,It's right now.
Leslie Knope,The time is now.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Great, right?"
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Look at you!
Leslie Knope,You're looking pretty unhealthy today.
Leslie Knope,"You might need one of these, NutriYum, by Sweetums."
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat them, Sweetums!"
Leslie Knope,We're gonna sell these in the park now.
Leslie Knope,"No, they're not."
Leslie Knope,There's a picture of Lance Armstrong on there.
Leslie Knope,There's only eight grams of fat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, people seem to enjoy them."
Leslie Knope,Look how happy everybody is.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That makes sense.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm gonna crash soon, too."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause I've eaten, like, 40 of these."
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I can't open them.
Leslie Knope,Back to work.
Leslie Knope,I hate it here.
Leslie Knope,This place is evil.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, let's take them both."
Leslie Knope,We might find something interesting.
Leslie Knope,"Here, just let me stick them under my shirt."
Leslie Knope,Just walk out.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Marci."
Leslie Knope,You're pretty cocky for someone whose job is obsolete because of the Internet.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, grab the movie!"
Leslie Knope,"Go, go, go, go!"
Leslie Knope,Punkass book jockeys!
Leslie Knope,"Actually, no."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We are worried that the energy bars that they're gonna sell are grossly unhealthy and they're misleading people about what's actually in them.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, can I have a sidebar with Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"Sidebar, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I did some research, and NutriYums are terrible for you."
Leslie Knope,That's a-- We're in a sidebar.
Leslie Knope,Do you not care about your city's health?
Leslie Knope,"Paul, can you and I have a sidebar?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think maybe we should hold a public forum.
Leslie Knope,That way we won't be liable.
Leslie Knope,"Sidebar, Paul."
Leslie Knope,Ron's upset because I didn't let him drive last night.
Leslie Knope,Somebody's grouchy.
Leslie Knope,I'm actually encouraged.
Leslie Knope,The questions were more relevant than usual.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it doesn't, actually."
Leslie Knope,"I think we should watch another video right now, one that your company made 30 years ago."
Leslie Knope,"So, you still want to claim that corn syrup is healthy?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Newport, Jr., thank you so much for coming."
Leslie Knope,"But don't you think that every person has a right to know what they're putting in their bodies? Right, everybody?"
Leslie Knope,"Denver, you little son of a bitch."
Leslie Knope,That seems like an unfair phrasing.
Leslie Knope,"And all those in favor of letting this heartless corporation, Sweetums, stuff your children with sugary crap, raise your hand."
Leslie Knope,You know what? We did our job.
Leslie Knope,We informed the public.
Leslie Knope,That's all we can do.
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,"This is America, right? Is it?"
Leslie Knope,"May I speak with you, please? Look, I don't know if you're being a jerk on purpose just to prove you have the right to be a jerk, but either way, you're being a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"So, here."
Leslie Knope,Take the booze chart.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"If you're gonna drink, you should use it, okay? I'm gonna head out."
Leslie Knope,"By the way, maybe it's none of my business, but if you eat three pounds of steak every day, you're gonna die, and although I've already written your eulogy, and it's incredibly touching, I would prefer not to give it for a while."
Leslie Knope,"The first line, by the way? ""O Captain! My Captain! Ron Swanson, a swan song."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and it gets better from there."
Leslie Knope,I didn't have time to have breakfast.
Leslie Knope,Apology accepted.
Leslie Knope,Put a coat on.
Leslie Knope,It's freezing outside.
Leslie Knope,"If you look inside your bags, you will find a few things."
Leslie Knope,A bouquet of handcrocheted flower pensâ¦
Leslie Knope,"A mosaic portrait of each of you made from the crushed bottles of your favorite diet soda, and a personalized 5000 word essay of why you are all so awesome."
Leslie Knope,What's Galentine's Day?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's only the best day of the year."
Leslie Knope,"Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home and we just come and kick it breakfast style."
Leslie Knope,Ladies celebrating ladies.
Leslie Knope,It's like Lilith Fair minus the angst.
Leslie Knope,Plus frittatas.
Leslie Knope,"So to conclude our Galentine's Day breakfast, it is time for the greatest story ever told."
Leslie Knope,"Go, Mom, go."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but the drama."
Leslie Knope,So they sneak out to meet each other and walk on the beach.
Leslie Knope,"And two weeks later, he asked her to marry him and move to Illinois."
Leslie Knope,"But her parents thought she was too young, so she said no."
Leslie Knope,"And then they lost touch, and a few years later she met my dad."
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,He's probably married or dead.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,"But if you find him and he's weird, like a ventriloquist, or a puppeteer, or anyone who pretends toys are people, then abort the mission."
Leslie Knope,"Troops, gather around."
Leslie Knope,Great news.
Leslie Knope,"The Senior Center Valentine's Dance is tomorrow, from 5:00 to 9:00."
Leslie Knope,"It isn't just a job, gang, we're gonna learn a lot from these seniors."
Leslie Knope,Some of them have been married for half a century.
Leslie Knope,"And no offense, but everybody here is terrible at love."
Leslie Knope,"Divorced, dating a gay guy, divorced twice, jury's still out on you two."
Leslie Knope,"And Jerry, who knows."
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,"Finally, Ann and Mark are our special volunteers, and they will be available whenever needed."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, too bad."
Leslie Knope,You got drafted.
Leslie Knope,"Ask not what your old people could do for you, ask what you could do for your old people."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, JFK."
Leslie Knope,This meeting has been terminated.
Leslie Knope,That is the Terminator.
Leslie Knope,Where am I going?
Leslie Knope,"Well, hello there."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,You guys sound ready for the dance tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Think of it this way.
Leslie Knope,"These songs are exactly like the songs you usually play, except instead of modern rock, they're old jazzy standards from the '40s."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do great.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I need a half a day off for a secret mission of love."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,Justin and I need to go on a romantically inspired road trip.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're planning to leave around noon, so I'm not quite sure--"
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,For our nooner.
Leslie Knope,Which is a cute word.
Leslie Knope,Explain what?
Leslie Knope,Do you think they'll get married?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, what if they get married?"
Leslie Knope,"Would I call him ""Dad"" then?"
Leslie Knope,"No, that'd be too much."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe I'll call him ""Pappy."""
Leslie Knope,Pop?
Leslie Knope,Poppy?
Leslie Knope,PawPaw?
Leslie Knope,Look at me.
Leslie Knope,I'm getting ahead of myself.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna call him ""PooPaw."""
Leslie Knope,How often do you get to reunite soul mates?
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that you could reunite Romeo and Juliet?
Leslie Knope,Or Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jen."
Leslie Knope,I really want you to be happy.
Leslie Knope,Stay away from John Mayer.
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Frank Beckerson.
Leslie Knope,I feel like I've known him my whole life.
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,PooPaw.
Leslie Knope,"PooPaw, no."
Leslie Knope,I'm not Marlene.
Leslie Knope,"Frank, I was wondering."
Leslie Knope,My mom always said that you wanted to be a lawyer.
Leslie Knope,Did that work out?
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Look how young she is.
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"So, Frank, where have you been for the past 40 years?"
Leslie Knope,So you were in the military?
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"Frank, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,A what?
Leslie Knope,I have a purse.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"Frank, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Frank.
Leslie Knope,Frank.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't feel right about this.
Leslie Knope,"He's a loon, Justin."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, he cried himself to sleep."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't know why you're pushing."
Leslie Knope,Why do you want him to spend time with my mom?
Leslie Knope,How would that help her?
Leslie Knope,I don't like this.
Leslie Knope,I don't think this is gonna work.
Leslie Knope,I'm calling this off.
Leslie Knope,"What happens is, I drive him home."
Leslie Knope,I'm breathing.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Mom.
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,"One that we'd love to tell you over a cup of coffee, somewhere far from this place."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Do you think we should stand by--
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mom, are you okay? Did Frank leave?"
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry we brought him here.
Leslie Knope,"My boyfriend is a lawyer, and he's smart and interesting, and there's a lot of things about him I like."
Leslie Knope,But he acted like a real jerk today.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,There's something about the way he treats people or something.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is no way for adults to act in front of children."
Leslie Knope,"You're not only coaches, you're also role models."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Excellent role modeling.
Leslie Knope,"Apparently, the girls' team does not have a field assigned to them for practice, but the boys' team does."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,"Every child has the right to play, no matter how boring the sport."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Could you just share the field with the girls today, please?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, why don't the boys take the field today."
Leslie Knope,And then I will make sure that the girls get a place to practice by the end of the week.
Leslie Knope,"And that, little lady, is a Leslie Knope promise!"
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,'Cause I wasn't talking to you.
Leslie Knope,I was talking to you.
Leslie Knope,"You're a girl, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,She.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's an envelope from the IOW Awards Office!
Leslie Knope,Nobody freak out!
Leslie Knope,Do you know what this means?
Leslie Knope,I am Pawnee's Woman of the Year!
Leslie Knope,The IOW is the Indiana Organization of Women.
Leslie Knope,I have been a dues paying member since I was nine.
Leslie Knope,"And every year, they choose one woman to win the Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award."
Leslie Knope,Winning is every girl's dream.
Leslie Knope,But it's my destiny.
Leslie Knope,And my dream.
Leslie Knope,"Can you read it, please?"
Leslie Knope,Where are my ladies at?
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Haha.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, pretty funny."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,"No, it doesn't."
Leslie Knope,I-- That-- No.
Leslie Knope,That-- What?
Leslie Knope,They only honor women.
Leslie Knope,And Ron's the opposite of a woman.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,They've obviously made some sort of mistake.
Leslie Knope,I just don't get why the IOW would give that award to Ron.
Leslie Knope,"One, he's not a woman."
Leslie Knope,"And two, they mentioned the Camp Athena project in that letter."
Leslie Knope,That's my project.
Leslie Knope,I started that.
Leslie Knope,It was my brainchild.
Leslie Knope,Why would Ron start a camp for troubled girls?
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,I deserve that award.
Leslie Knope,That award is mine.
Leslie Knope,Not his.
Leslie Knope,It's mine.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I already started a list."
Leslie Knope,"""Write an email to Barack Obama."""
Leslie Knope,"""Lock myself in my office and scream until I lose my voice."""
Leslie Knope,That's all I have so far.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,I have so much I need to tell you right now.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What's in the envelope?
Leslie Knope,I think the Pawnee Chapter of the IOW has made a little mistake.
Leslie Knope,I was as surprised as you were.
Leslie Knope,"But the fact is, they only give that award to women."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but it also mentioned my camp project."
Leslie Knope,Athena.
Leslie Knope,Camp Athena.
Leslie Knope,You don't even know the name.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's a man's world, Winston."
Leslie Knope,Get used to it.
Leslie Knope,You know who you should talk to?
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,He's an award winning public servant.
Leslie Knope,He's the guy that's gonna help you out.
Leslie Knope,Go on in there.
Leslie Knope,"If you don't get credit for your work, why bother doing it?"
Leslie Knope,Because I love it!
Leslie Knope,But I'm going to make a point!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
Leslie Knope,IOW.
Leslie Knope,Did you need me?
Leslie Knope,Because some of us actually do work around here.
Leslie Knope,Work that often goes unrewarded.
Leslie Knope,How's the scheduling conflict with the soccer teams going?
Leslie Knope,"Take care of that, did you?"
Leslie Knope,That's not really the attitude I'd expect from an award winner.
Leslie Knope,"Twenty-six certificates , plaques, ribbons, trophies, medals and miscellany certifying that I am the kind of person who deserves recognition for her achievements."
Leslie Knope,Dorothy Everton Smythe.
Leslie Knope,"I swear to God, I would--"
Leslie Knope,Another organization giving you credit for something you didn't do?
Leslie Knope,"""I, Ron Swanson, recognize that Leslie Knope should have received the IOW Award for all the hard work she has done, especially for the Camp Athena project."""
Leslie Knope,"""However, in my opinion, she is far too concerned with institutional gratification."""
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,"""So, I am going to let her dangle in order to show her that awards are bull crap."""
Leslie Knope,You do attend a shocking number of WNBA games.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right."
Leslie Knope,But Dorothy Everton Smythe was a trailblazing feminist.
Leslie Knope,She was the first woman in Pawnee to wear pants on a Sunday.
Leslie Knope,She spent four years in jail for that.
Leslie Knope,"I know I'm not supposed to care about these things, but this one means a lot."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"The IOW is a bunch of sexist jerks who need to get back in the kitchen where they belong, and leave the real feminist work to actual feminists like Ron Swanson!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What is happening?
Leslie Knope,Unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,"No, I want you to accept it."
Leslie Knope,I want you to go to the podium and talk about how stupid awards are.
Leslie Knope,And how they are superficial and meaningless.
Leslie Knope,I want you to rip awards a new a-hole!
Leslie Knope,I won't.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna push my punches as far as my fists can extend!
Leslie Knope,"Get over yourself, Elise."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to say.
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, I'm just very honored to work for someone as insightful and kind as my boss."
Leslie Knope,"So, I would like to present this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Award to Ron Swanson."
Leslie Knope,You deserve it.
Leslie Knope,"No, Ron, you deserve it."
Leslie Knope,But you won it.
Leslie Knope,And you should win it.
Leslie Knope,I'm being ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll take it."
Leslie Knope,Who do I speak to about getting this changed?
Leslie Knope,Figures.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello!"
Leslie Knope,I've always dreamed of you.
Leslie Knope,Meeting you.
Leslie Knope,What can I do for you?
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Rufus.
Leslie Knope,We all know Rufus.
Leslie Knope,Everybody loves Rufus.
Leslie Knope,He's a great dog.
Leslie Knope,Continue.
Leslie Knope,Rufus was bitten by a possum?
Leslie Knope,It was Fairway Frank.
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank is this awful possum who lives near the sixth hole of the public golf course.
Leslie Knope,"And he's actually number three on the Parks Department's Most Wanted Pest List, right behind the bats, who like to poop on the bell tower, and Poopy, the raccoon who poops all over the high school cafeteria."
Leslie Knope,They're a bunch of burned out morons.
Leslie Knope,A task force?
Leslie Knope,"Ma'am, the next time we speak, we shall be dancing on the grave of a possum."
Leslie Knope,Ron will show you around.
Leslie Knope,Eugene!
Leslie Knope,"Boy, we have a really important job for you."
Leslie Knope,Today's Wednesday.
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is not a request."
Leslie Knope,Office.
Leslie Knope,I need your two best guys to join me and be part of my task force.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, that stupid possum is on the golf course again."
Leslie Knope,"Would you rather I capture it myself, and then just call you, so you can come and pick it up?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,Cool!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you want your ball back?"
Leslie Knope,Want your ball back?
Leslie Knope,Come with me.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, there's five of us and only one possum."
Leslie Knope,How hard can it be?
Leslie Knope,Excuse us!
Leslie Knope,Task force coming through!
Leslie Knope,Task force clear.
Leslie Knope,Resume golfing.
Leslie Knope,I could teach you.
Leslie Knope,I have a 16 handicap.
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, it takes a lot of practice."
Leslie Knope,"You have to get up early, hit the range, practice reading greens."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,It's Fairway Frank!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I want you to very slowlyâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we may only get one chance to catch this thing, so we have to play it smart."
Leslie Knope,"You two, flank the left."
Leslie Knope,I'll flank the right.
Leslie Knope,Andy will come in to--
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Task force, engage!"
Leslie Knope,"Come on, you cowards!"
Leslie Knope,Let me see his face.
Leslie Knope,Let me see his face!
Leslie Knope,That's him!
Leslie Knope,That's him!
Leslie Knope,We got him!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, okay, okay!"
Leslie Knope,"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
Leslie Knope,"All right, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"You're next, Poopy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,I had a great task force.
Leslie Knope,I was just the simple mastermind who planned the whole operation and executed it to perfection.
Leslie Knope,"This is Andy Dwyer, he actually caught the thing."
Leslie Knope,Task force.
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I will!"
Leslie Knope,I need so many special favors.
Leslie Knope,Which one should I choose?
Leslie Knope,How about an extra recycling can?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Laminated bus pass?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What time do you usually go to sleep?
Leslie Knope,Because my best ideas usually come to me at night.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right."
Leslie Knope,Am I sure the possum we caught is Fairway Frank?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Am I quite sure?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Am I sure enough?
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"If it wasn't Fairway Frank, would I feel badly?"
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Could I live with myself?
Leslie Knope,That depends.
Leslie Knope,"As a city official, it's important that I ask myself a lot of questions."
Leslie Knope,Does doing so help me make decisions?
Leslie Knope,Uhâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"You remember Shauna Malwee-Tweep, from the Pawnee Journal?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we see a possum that we believe to be Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,"So, for right now, let's just refer to it as a possum."
Leslie Knope,Of the possum.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we're making really good progress on the park."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, there may be some big news on that front coming soon, all because of this very important business card."
Leslie Knope,"So, this isn't a really big story, right?"
Leslie Knope,Nobody cares about this very much.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April, can I talk to you about this situation with the possum?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hypothetically, if you were going on a mission to, say, catch a guilty whale."
Leslie Knope,"And while you were catching the whale, you saw something else that may also be another whale, and you were like, ""What?"""
Leslie Knope,"But then you thought, maybe it's not a whale."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a big fish.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a submarine with a face painted on it.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, if I kill the first whale, am I technically a murderer?"
Leslie Knope,I saw a second possum!
Leslie Knope,There was another possum!
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank's been haunting the sixth hole for a while now.
Leslie Knope,You must know him pretty well.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Campopiano, those are photos of three different possums."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Those idiots are here from Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,They're gonna take it away.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We need a little bit more time to figure out the truth.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna distract everybody and then you get that possum out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Can you do that, April?"
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do that?"
Leslie Knope,Can you get the possum out of here?
Leslie Knope,Can you sneak it out of here?
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do it?"
Leslie Knope,Can you do it?
Leslie Knope,"Please, April, tell me you can do it!"
Leslie Knope,"I can't kill the possum, because it might be innocent."
Leslie Knope,"I can't let the possum go, because it might be guilty."
Leslie Knope,"I can't make a good soup, can't do a handstand in a pool, can't spell the word ""lieutenant."""
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of can'ts in my life right now.
Leslie Knope,"Help! Help, my arm looks like it's bleeding!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look how much it's bleeding."
Leslie Knope,Everybody look at it.
Leslie Knope,Everybody look over here! I need everyone's full attention during this.
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's so--"
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, Evelyn, we're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,Does he want to have sex with a dead possum?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ew!
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but he's somewhere you'll never find it and he's gonna stay there until the truth comes out."
Leslie Knope,"And I will not reveal his location, no matter how much you ask me."
Leslie Knope,"But I'm going to stop talking now because I'm afraid I may accidentally say where it is, so please go."
Leslie Knope,This is interesting.
Leslie Knope,They put down a raccoon that bit a jogger in a park in Staten Island.
Leslie Knope,"And in Walnut Creek, California, they put down a duck that bit a kid."
Leslie Knope,But security footage later revealed that it was actually a goose.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's awful, Tom."
Leslie Knope,How would you feel if you killed an innocent duck and let a vicious goose waddle free?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"April! April, it's Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! How did this happen?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna fix this.
Leslie Knope,Let me just think for a second.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No! Okay, where did it go?"
Leslie Knope,"Here's what we do, we just go outside."
Leslie Knope,All right? Let's just go outside! Get in here!
Leslie Knope,"I know there's a door there, but I kind of feel like it's going to chew through the door and come and jump on my face and bite me."
Leslie Knope,What if it's in here?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there, there are no eggs! You know, we should've killed it."
Leslie Knope,It's so huge.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna call Andy.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"He tackled it once before, he can do it again."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,He'll forgive you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We don't have to call Andy.
Leslie Knope,We can just call Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,"And, April, any time you want to talk about boys--"
Leslie Knope,"You didn't have to say that, you could've just thought it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm proud to say that it's somewhere the mayor can never pee on it."
Leslie Knope,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,Honestly.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look."
Leslie Knope,"When I retire and I'm attending some gala honoring the first three female presidents in history, myself and two other women I've inspired, I want to be looking back at my distinguished legacy and not thinking that I owe my career to some possum."
Leslie Knope,"And I want to be wearing a huge, beautiful, blue hat!"
Leslie Knope,Possum.
Leslie Knope,There was a possum.
Leslie Knope,We captured a possum and we brought it into your house and it got out and it might have laid eggs in your bed.
Leslie Knope,"And it went into your laundry and your kitchen, and it touched all your bras and I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,It's our fault.
Leslie Knope,We captured it and it got out and it ran around and it was a possum.
Leslie Knope,"Okay? April, run! Run, April."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, Ann! I love you!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Time for the hummingbird lottery.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know how it works.
Leslie Knope,Write your name down on a piece of paper.
Leslie Knope,"No, they don't win a hummingbird."
Leslie Knope,"I installed hummingbird feeders in all the parks, so the winner gets to refill those feeders."
Leslie Knope,"Scientifically, hummingbirds are the world's cutest animals."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're so small."
Leslie Knope,And they have tiny beaks.
Leslie Knope,And they only eat sugar water.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what beats that?"
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Baby monkeys in diapers?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,They do.
Leslie Knope,Baby monkeys in diapers are the cutest.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Who's it going to be?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,You can stop by tomorrow morning before work.
Leslie Knope,"No, I always write my own name."
Leslie Knope,"But just to be safe, I do add 20 extra ""Jerry""s."
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we are going to kick off the Children's Concert Series this weekend with a performance by Freddy Spaghetti."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's Mr. Funny Noodle.
Leslie Knope,"And he didn't OD, his drummer shot him."
Leslie Knope,"Where is Jerry, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,Why isn't he back?
Leslie Knope,How long does it take to fill bird feeders?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,That's enough.
Leslie Knope,Unless somebody has another good one.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, is Jerry okay?"
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with your arm?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, tell me what's wrong with Jerry's arm."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, talk to me."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, get Jerry to talk to me."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,I was mugged.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so sorry, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Did any of them have weird tattoos or scars or anything?
Leslie Knope,"If even one of them had a unique scar, we got them."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,You're the victim.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I feel like we're responsible for this.
Leslie Knope,"Well, why was he in the park in the first place?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,This is on us.
Leslie Knope,It's karma.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's not funny."
Leslie Knope,Our friend got mugged this morning.
Leslie Knope,And we will not let that happen in vain.
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, the whole department has a black eye."
Leslie Knope,"This is our wakeup call, guys."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's face is the symbol of failure.
Leslie Knope,Our failure to keep the parks safe.
Leslie Knope,I have some folders.
Leslie Knope,Inside are some assignments.
Leslie Knope,And some homemade taffy.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"April, I want you to check in with our police liaison."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, I need you to go to Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're with me."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Just check in with him.
Leslie Knope,Everybody dismissed.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,We need it.
Leslie Knope,Because we certainly are a bunch of weaklings.
Leslie Knope,Especially Tom.
Leslie Knope,"Haha, guys."
Leslie Knope,Really funny.
Leslie Knope,Where's the real banner?
Leslie Knope,So did I.
Leslie Knope,Look what I did.
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It's no trouble for our buddy.
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,Listen.
Leslie Knope,Today is Jerry Day.
Leslie Knope,We'll do whatever you want to do.
Leslie Knope,Anything at all.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Remember, you guys."
Leslie Knope,No jokes.
Leslie Knope,No comments.
Leslie Knope,Nothing but support.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, seriously."
Leslie Knope,That was the last one.
Leslie Knope,Um Jerry?
Leslie Knope,I don't... I don't think your computer is plugged in.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, Muncie is a lovely city."
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's important to meet with the Park Rangers."
Leslie Knope,They are the first line of defense.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Carl."
Leslie Knope,I just feel like there's more we can do to keep the parks safe.
Leslie Knope,Kind of small feet.
Leslie Knope,"I know this is painful for you, Jerry, but you have to be strong."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,We're ready.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm looking forward to working together, Carl."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"That's Tom, probably."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, can you get off, please?"
Leslie Knope,"Just run alongside the cart, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Can't you station a Park Ranger out here?
Leslie Knope,"One way or another, I'm going to get money so you can protect Jerry, and all the other helpless, pathetic people in this town."
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,No can do.
Leslie Knope,Sun's going down and it's real dangerous out here.
Leslie Knope,"Let's roll, Carl."
Leslie Knope,"This is my coworker, Jerry Gergich."
Leslie Knope,Diabetic.
Leslie Knope,Sloppily out of shape.
Leslie Knope,Friend.
Leslie Knope,He was mugged this morning in Ramsett Park.
Leslie Knope,Who's next?
Leslie Knope,Your frumpy uncle?
Leslie Knope,Your simple neighbor?
Leslie Knope,Your unpopular coworker?
Leslie Knope,"Head of security, Carl Lorthner, is doing his best to keep the parks safe, but he's failing."
Leslie Knope,We need money from City Hall.
Leslie Knope,And it's not coming through.
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee, I am sorry to say this, but your government is failing you."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Paul, but one of my guys got mugged in the park."
Leslie Knope,I don't know who you're referring to.
Leslie Knope,We treat everyone with respect around here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you nervous?"
Leslie Knope,Just talk about how hard it was for you.
Leslie Knope,Speak from the heart.
Leslie Knope,You'll be fine.
Leslie Knope,"No, I will."
Leslie Knope,Get up here.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to speak for Jerry.
Leslie Knope,He can't talk right now because he has hysterical muteness from trauma.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,What about this?
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?
Leslie Knope,Were you even in the park yesterday?
Leslie Knope,The farting.
Leslie Knope,"Well, why didn't you just tell everybody the truth?"
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Jerry! You jumped in a creek for a burrito? What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Kill your wife?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but now, we have the money under false pretenses."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Knope.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Carl.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Carl, could you quietly quiet down for a second, and please tell me what is going on, quietly? Okay? In a quiet voice."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look."
Leslie Knope,I have a proposition for you.
Leslie Knope,That's not what I am saying.
Leslie Knope,Okay? Just listen to what I have to say.
Leslie Knope,I disagree with Carl.
Leslie Knope,"I have seen Avatar as well, and I think it exceeded the hype."
Leslie Knope,"Oh boy, weâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,I am part of a great team.
Leslie Knope,"And sometimes, the best way to maintain a strong team is just by letting someone know that he is still a part of it."
Leslie Knope,"This is the only copy, and I am going to destroy it."
Leslie Knope,Right after I watch it one more time.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but it is so good."
Leslie Knope,Making fun of Jerry is back!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise for you.
Leslie Knope,Meet me at Harvey James Park at 11:30.
Leslie Knope,It's a surprise!
Leslie Knope,What's the surprise?
Leslie Knope,"If I told you, it would ruin the surprise."
Leslie Knope,I cannot tell you that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but you're gonna like this one."
Leslie Knope,I'm not telling you.
Leslie Knope,And I'm not gonna tell anybody!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you.
Leslie Knope,We're putting together the Parks Department Summer Catalog.
Leslie Knope,"And the big surprise is I am going to reunite all the living former Parks Directors at a picnic, record the whole thing, and then write about it in the ""Welcome Letter."""
Leslie Knope,It's the biggest catalog of the year.
Leslie Knope,Think of the September issue of Vogue.
Leslie Knope,But it's more important to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Mainly because we don't get Vogue here.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna move this ""Yearning"" ad to the centerfold."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need to see your softball pictures."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, good job."
Leslie Knope,Nice work.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it is."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I don't know if I made it clear, but I don't want any sex offenders in our Parks catalog."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, April."
Leslie Knope,Enough.
Leslie Knope,Cover photo.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're up."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this isn't gonna work for a number of reasons."
Leslie Knope,"One, this is a summer catalog."
Leslie Knope,"Two, that was complete gibberish."
Leslie Knope,"And three, that child looks like it's abandoned."
Leslie Knope,"So, basically, boo."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know if I have time for this, guys, so, let's just pick a good photo, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,Get me that.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I gotta go.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, don't play with the food, okay?"
Leslie Knope,We need this for the picnic.
Leslie Knope,Do we have everything?
Leslie Knope,Smoked salmon?
Leslie Knope,This is probably the first time in history these four great men have been in the same place at the same time.
Leslie Knope,It kind of makes you-- What is this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Somebody's here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, just act normal."
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,Just be like normal people.
Leslie Knope,Hello!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,David Moser!
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,It is such an honor to meet you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, not very long."
Leslie Knope,"I realize, of course, you're a very busy man."
Leslie Knope,I love parks.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if that's something I've communicated before.
Leslie Knope,"So, having a picnic with all the former living Parks Department Directors-- Guess who just checked something off her bucket list?"
Leslie Knope,"Clarence Carrington, David Moser, Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson, gathered together on a beautiful day in this beautiful park."
Leslie Knope,I think we should just take a moment and appreciate how lucky we are.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,"When I say ""parks,"" you say ""department!"""
Leslie Knope,Parks!
Leslie Knope,Parks!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,This is taking a lot longer than I thought it would.
Leslie Knope,Can you guys run up ahead and set up the picnic?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Look, what was going on back there?"
Leslie Knope,Why all the sniping?
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, don't be such a baby."
Leslie Knope,I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Clarence, um, why don't you describe the first Summer Pawnee Catalog."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I thought there were female teachers way before then.
Leslie Knope,"Well, times have changed."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Deputy Director now, but I'm hoping someday to be the first female director of the department."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"David, what was it exactly that called you to the Parks Department?"
Leslie Knope,There was no other reason you wanted the job?
Leslie Knope,"Well, David, I think we've talked enough."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,We're almost there.
Leslie Knope,It's right up here.
Leslie Knope,Holy God.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we are.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it hasn't gone exactly as I've hoped."
Leslie Knope,But I got them all here and we're gonna have a beautiful picnic.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna-- It's gonna be good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog."
Leslie Knope,Did you?
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit about how the department has changed since you ran it.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Michael."
Leslie Knope,I appreciate that.
Leslie Knope,Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,I totally agree.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank goodness for you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, ha, ha."
Leslie Knope,"Very funny, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you know what I would love?"
Leslie Knope,"I would love if anybody just said something positive about, oh, I don't know, anything."
Leslie Knope,Another?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, stop it!"
Leslie Knope,Stop it!
Leslie Knope,"You're all being awful, horrible men!"
Leslie Knope,"Clarence, if you mention anything about women, or menstruation, or anything, I'm gonna take your face and I'm gonna shove it in those brambles."
Leslie Knope,"No! You're next, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Andy! Let's take this picture.
Leslie Knope,"Come on! Get out of your seats, turds."
Leslie Knope,Line up over there.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Just please try to look human.
Leslie Knope,"All right, and not so evil."
Leslie Knope,Everybody looking here.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for the wonderful memories.
Leslie Knope,Everybody take their stuff and go.
Leslie Knope,Do you have that picture that Andy took? Maybe I'll run it without any text.
Leslie Knope,God! Look at these horrible men.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't even know if I want them in my catalog."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, April."
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You want me to read you what I have so far in my welcome letter? Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Because you and your jerk predecessors didn't give me anything to work with.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Oh! Wisdom! Finally.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,You can also keep the photo.
Leslie Knope,Thanks for the memories.
Leslie Knope,That-- That's the wrong one.
Leslie Knope,But the real one's very bad as well.
Leslie Knope,"I want you to know that I'm replacing the ""Welcome Letter"" with this ad for Yearning by Dennis Feinstein."
Leslie Knope,"So goodbye, distilled wisdom of 50 years of experience."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, disgusting fragrance flap."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I insist you buy me dinner.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too, Marta."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ron, I really made love to the pooch on this one."
Leslie Knope,I don't like that term.
Leslie Knope,It's so vulgar.
Leslie Knope,"Ron! That sucked, today."
Leslie Knope,"Leslie, you are the next link in a wonderful chain that stretches back to when our town was founded, and we believe in you and we support you and we'll be following your career."
Leslie Knope,"""You are the chosen one."""
Leslie Knope,Or something.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You know what the worst part is is I wanna be Parks Director.
Leslie Knope,But every single person who was Parks Director hated their job and hated everyone they worked with.
Leslie Knope,Are we gonna hate each other someday?
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, the point's moot, because you're Park Director now and you're not going anywhere and I'm not making you go anywhere."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not gonna stab you in the back or anything, soâ¦ Maybe I should go somewhere."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe I should move, to Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, the thought of that."
Leslie Knope,Who knows what the future holds for me?
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job and become City Manager.
Leslie Knope,"Of course, my first act as City Manager would be to double the size of the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Although, I do expect a fight from Ron."
Leslie Knope,But I'll win.
Leslie Knope,Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,"""My fellow Pawneeans, Yes, it's here! The Parks Department's Summer Catalog has arrived and for the first time in 20 years, tennis is back! Peruse this wondrous book at your leisure and take advantage of everything this great town has to offer."""
Leslie Knope,"""Time is fleeting, my fellow Pawneeans."""
Leslie Knope,"""Make the most of it, while you can."""
Leslie Knope,"""I recently had the honor of spending an afternoon""with every living former Parks Director, and they taught me a valuable lesson, there is nothing more important than friendship."""
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not kidding."
Leslie Knope,He made a bong out of a taxidermied raccoon?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, nice shot."
Leslie Knope,In the neck!
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,I love having things run by me.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Leslie Knope,I genuinely love it.
Leslie Knope,Run it by me.
Leslie Knope,Go ahead!
Leslie Knope,"Go, go, go."
Leslie Knope,"I would say that some women won't consider moving in with someone unless they think marriage is in the future, which I know, for you is--"
Leslie Knope,For realskies?
Leslie Knope,I'm not really quite sure how I feel.
Leslie Knope,I-- It's a little weird.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm happy for them."
Leslie Knope,They're my friends.
Leslie Knope,It makes me a little nauseous.
Leslie Knope,"If I could just sum it up in one word, it would beâ¦ ohâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, how fun!"
Leslie Knope,I have a better idea.
Leslie Knope,"Why don't I try to rustle up seven more meetings, 'cause I think it would be cooler if there were an even 100"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect distraction for me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I have everything I need, right?"
Leslie Knope,"I have a fresh cup of coffee, comfy furlined boots."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no problem."
Leslie Knope,They're actually a little narrow for me.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director."
Leslie Knope,I understand that.
Leslie Knope,He's tied up right now.
Leslie Knope,"""Alterations""?"
Leslie Knope,Turnbill Mansion is one of the most beloved historical sites in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"In 1867, the progressive Reverend Turnbill officiated a wedding between a white woman and a Wamapoke Indian chief."
Leslie Knope,The secret ceremony was beautiful and romantic.
Leslie Knope,"But then word got out, and the reception was a bloodbath."
Leslie Knope,"Fortunately, there were two survivors."
Leslie Knope,"Unfortunately, they were both horses."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, why didn't you try to stop her?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody just relax."
Leslie Knope,What alterations is she trying to make?
Leslie Knope,"Drilling holes, painting, removing wainscoting, she's tearing down the gazebo."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,She's what?
Leslie Knope,"No, she's not."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, go get the car."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"God, these are tight!"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'll meet you at the car."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ron, as much as I would like to go for the ""all-time City Hall single day meetings record,"" there is an emergency."
Leslie Knope,Someone is trying to alter a gazebo.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Sorry I can't hang out.
Leslie Knope,I kind of have an emergency.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thanks for the coffee."
Leslie Knope,"I really need it, though."
Leslie Knope,"But next time more sugar, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, bye."
Leslie Knope,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,It's gorgeous.
Leslie Knope,What kind of monster would wanna change this?
Leslie Knope,"You know, they may be rich, but they can't just destroy history."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Ah, Mr. Newport Sr. I've just been informed that you plan on altering this mansion."
Leslie Knope,"And as a member of the Parks Department, as a Pawneean and an American, I ask you to refrain from harming this historic structure."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, yes."
Leslie Knope,We've met before.
Leslie Knope,We were both judges at the pageant last year.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that sounds so romantic."
Leslie Knope,"Um, Jessica, I know you've rented out this house for a party."
Leslie Knope,"But it's on the historical register, so we can't allow any changes."
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,That's a saying everywhere.
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe we can just limit the damage."
Leslie Knope,How much have you done?
Leslie Knope,You painted this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,These were the original hardwood floors.
Leslie Knope,I can't--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Why did you have to drill holes in the wall?
Leslie Knope,"Isn't there a way that you could've-- Oh, my!"
Leslie Knope,History is important.
Leslie Knope,You just can't go around changing everything all of the time.
Leslie Knope,"Or else next thing you know, they'll be painting the White House not white."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so angry, I can't think of another color."
Leslie Knope,Green.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God you haven't torn down the gazebo yet."
Leslie Knope,Ugly thing?
Leslie Knope,"Let me tell you a little something about this ""ugly thing,"" ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"A hundred and fifty years ago, an interracial couple was married here, and then slaughtered by their own families."
Leslie Knope,It's one of the most beautiful stories in Pawnee's history.
Leslie Knope,Why are you trying to destroy it?
Leslie Knope,Your husband's a mushy old pile of rot.
Leslie Knope,I am not a stick-in-the-mud!
Leslie Knope,I just want to stop a party from happening.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,"I have a gazebo update, so ignore all my previous voicemails and emails."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm sorry, but this can't wait."
Leslie Knope,Jessica Wicks refuses to--
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser!
Leslie Knope,Nice to see you again.
Leslie Knope,"Not that I saw anything, other than your face, and I would like to talk to you a little bit about this gazebo thing."
Leslie Knope,"You know, the problem--"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,I saw your penis.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Leslie Knope,I'm kind of freaking out about this historical mansion thing.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you for a second?
Leslie Knope,You're going on a date with Ann.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, have a good time."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for meeting me here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I need you to get this word for word.
Leslie Knope,"""Gazebo?"""
Leslie Knope,"More like ""Gazoinksbo."""
Leslie Knope,"She may be a former beauty queen, but today she's the king of destroying history!"""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"""Gazoinksbo."""
Leslie Knope,Jessica Wicks is throwing a birthday party for her husband Nick Newport Sr. at the Turnbill Mansion tonight.
Leslie Knope,So?
Leslie Knope,Crap on the cob!
Leslie Knope,"I have no other choice, okay?"
Leslie Knope,This is the only rational way I know to prevent this tragedy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Here they come.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, throw away the key!"
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Throw it!
Leslie Knope,"Sir, I'm sorry, but you're a little late."
Leslie Knope,"So, you're gonna have to turn this thing around, 'cause you're not getting in here."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God! Tom! Stop him! Jump in front of it! Sacrifice your tiny body! I really thought that gate would open in the middle."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the gazebo has been destroyed."
Leslie Knope,And the thing that bothers me the most--
Leslie Knope,"Cut it out, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann and Mark are coming."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, not so close."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna-- You're gonna-- Don't go past the sensor.
Leslie Knope,Sorry if I ruined your evening.
Leslie Knope,I chained myself to a gate.
Leslie Knope,Nothing's bruised but my ego.
Leslie Knope,"And my arm, a little, from the mechanized gate."
Leslie Knope,So what'd you guys talk about at dinner? Huh? Was it fun? Any big decisions arrived at?
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom's gonna take me."
Leslie Knope,You guys go on ahead.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, maybe that's not entirely what I'm upset about."
Leslie Knope,Mark and Ann are gonna get married.
Leslie Knope,"Every time a couple gets married, two single people die."
Leslie Knope,I'm about to lose two good friends.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, I know that."
Leslie Knope,In my brain.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,I just need toâ¦
Leslie Knope,...do one more thing.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm sorry, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, but I need to say something."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're probably thinking, ""There's that crazy gate lady from outside back again."""
Leslie Knope,"And to some extent, you're right."
Leslie Knope,I am the gate lady.
Leslie Knope,But the only thing I'm crazy about is leaving the past behind.
Leslie Knope,"So, I would like to apologize and raise a glass to change and forgiveness and the future and Ann and Mark, and happiness and Nick Newport Sr."
Leslie Knope,May all your future gazebos live long and prosper.
Leslie Knope,Is it weird if I ask to take a piece of cake with me? I won't.
Leslie Knope,Puppy!
Leslie Knope,Can we keep him?
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,In my belly.
Leslie Knope,Because the 24 hour Pawnee Cares Diabetes Telethon starts tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Every year, Pawnee Cares teams up with the local cable access station to raise money for diabetes research."
Leslie Knope,"And it's important, because Pawnee is the fourth fattest town in the U.S."
Leslie Knope,"It goes us, Dallas, Tulsa and certain parts of The Mall of America."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this year, I get to program my own four hour block."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Exciting!
Leslie Knope,"So, I have signed you all up for multiple shifts."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to answer phones and provide moral support."
Leslie Knope,Tonight.
Leslie Knope,From 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you put on one of these Tshirts?
Leslie Knope,It will get you in the mood.
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night last night making these.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,And here's why.
Leslie Knope,Boom.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Four hours to come up with the slogan.
Leslie Knope,Four hours to embroider them.
Leslie Knope,Salad sucks.
Leslie Knope,There.
Leslie Knope,I said it.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Is something wrong?
Leslie Knope,Horseback.
Leslie Knope,You should ask her on horseback.
Leslie Knope,"No, you should ask her in a hot air balloon."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"She should be on the hot air balloon, and you should ride up on horseback."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"She's in the balloon, you ride up on horseback, you point to the sky, up there, skywriting, ""Marry me, Ann."""
Leslie Knope,How you ask someone to marry you is a very big deal.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they have to repeat that story for the rest of their lives."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Definitely.
Leslie Knope,Can you get five eagles?
Leslie Knope,"No, get ten eagles."
Leslie Knope,"No, you're right."
Leslie Knope,It's your life.
Leslie Knope,Get as many eagles as you want.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, you're in for tonight, right?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You're in charge of the VIP special telethon guest.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to believe who I got.
Leslie Knope,People are going to freak out.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to guess.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Ex- lndiana Pacers small forward, Detlef Schrempf."
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,"So, it's really exciting."
Leslie Knope,And I need you to be his bodyman.
Leslie Knope,Pick him up at the airport at 7:00 p.m.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you know, just entertain him."
Leslie Knope,Because he doesn't need to be in hair and makeup until 2:00 a.m.
Leslie Knope,"Well, they have a communal lipstick and a box of combs."
Leslie Knope,I can definitely do it.
Leslie Knope,I've already been up for 24 hours.
Leslie Knope,But I have a secret weapon.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,They're terrible.
Leslie Knope,But they give me an insane 15 minute burst.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, my nana used to tell me, ""You'll sleep when you're dead."""
Leslie Knope,"My nana, she used to say the best stuff."
Leslie Knope,"""Don't work yourself into a lather."""
Leslie Knope,"""Look where it is and you'll find it."""
Leslie Knope,"""Don't put me in a home."""
Leslie Knope,"""Tell the truth and shame the devil."""
Leslie Knope,"""The devil knows where you're hiding."""
Leslie Knope,"""If you take enough rides with the devil, pretty soon, he's going to drive."""
Leslie Knope,She was really into the devil.
Leslie Knope,I have not checked in with you lately.
Leslie Knope,I'm randomly and casually asking.
Leslie Knope,How are things going with Mark?
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the one?
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I have you on phone answering duty from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m.
Leslie Knope,"All right, team, you guys psyched?"
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, all you need to do is take down everybody's name and address and ask them how much they want to donate."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, then."
Leslie Knope,You got the most lines.
Leslie Knope,"Figure it out, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's exciting.
Leslie Knope,What time is it?
Leslie Knope,I'm tired already.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, hello."
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,Right up there.
Leslie Knope,Who's next?
Leslie Knope,I feel great.
Leslie Knope,Everything is running smoothly.
Leslie Knope,Clipboard mouth.
Leslie Knope,Clipboard mouth.
Leslie Knope,There's some secret ingredient in these NutriYum bars that makes me feel so good.
Leslie Knope,Tigers.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,I'm up.
Leslie Knope,I need to pull it together.
Leslie Knope,My slot is coming up.
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,It's Tom.
Leslie Knope,He may have a Schrempf problem.
Leslie Knope,"You understand that, right?"
Leslie Knope,"T.B. continued, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Are you on your way?
Leslie Knope,That's awesome.
Leslie Knope,But you promised to get him here.
Leslie Knope,Get him here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Problem.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I know I told you that you were going on at 3:00 a.m. after the Detlef Schrempf interview and career retrospective, but you're going on now."
Leslie Knope,You're kicking things off.
Leslie Knope,"So, how are things going with you two?"
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"There are two types of diabetes, but only one type of caring."
Leslie Knope,Type One caring.
Leslie Knope,"And tonight, God willing, we will all be stricken with that."
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of fun stuff coming up.
Leslie Knope,"Indiana Pacers legend, Detlef Schrempf, will be joining us in the studio later on."
Leslie Knope,"But until then, I would like to introduce one of the hottest bands in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Mouse Rat."
Leslie Knope,"Well, okay."
Leslie Knope,Slight hiccup.
Leslie Knope,But we're back on track.
Leslie Knope,See that board?
Leslie Knope,"When my shift is done, that board is going to read 20,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'd like to donate 50 dollars, please."
Leslie Knope,"God, we're not getting any donations coming in."
Leslie Knope,I'm tired of waiting for people to call us.
Leslie Knope,Let's call them.
Leslie Knope,Everybody call somebody.
Leslie Knope,"Then, good."
Leslie Knope,They'll be home.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, someone good?"
Leslie Knope,You're not supposed to receive personal phone calls.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, has anyone seen Tom?"
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Wake up.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, wake up."
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,Were you having a bad dream?
Leslie Knope,That must be terrible.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm freaking out, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom is not here, and he's got Detlef Schrempf."
Leslie Knope,And I have three hours to fill.
Leslie Knope,Don't go back to sleep.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I need you to wake up.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Help me.
Leslie Knope,Attaboy.
Leslie Knope,"April, will you call some of the Rec Center teachers and see if they want to come down and show off their special skills?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Nod your head yes.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, that's disgusting and fake!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's real.
Leslie Knope,Go up there and do that.
Leslie Knope,You don't have a second egg?
Leslie Knope,Why are you wasting my time?
Leslie Knope,This is really serious!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is a disaster.
Leslie Knope,I am completely screwed.
Leslie Knope,"I have no Schrempf, no backup plan, no more NutriYum bars."
Leslie Knope,What do people want to watch?
Leslie Knope,Cute animals on a bike?
Leslie Knope,No time to train one.
Leslie Knope,Hot people kissing?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Maybe Mark and Ann wouldâ¦
Leslie Knope,I have a great idea.
Leslie Knope,I think you should propose to Ann tonight.
Leslie Knope,Today.
Leslie Knope,Whatever it is.
Leslie Knope,On camera.
Leslie Knope,For diabetes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,It would be so cool.
Leslie Knope,Don't you remember when Ahmad Rashad proposed to Mrs. Cosby on TV?
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Most women do.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, butâ¦"
Leslie Knope,We talked about it being something big.
Leslie Knope,And I don't think we can get a hot air balloon at this time of night.
Leslie Knope,Is there a story behind it?
Leslie Knope,Was she on the Titanic?
Leslie Knope,Was she on the Titanic?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, Barney, for that."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Leslie Knope,We'd like to make a quick announcement.
Leslie Knope,Detlef Schrempf is temporarily delayed.
Leslie Knope,"But coming soon, a really amazing thing is going to happen."
Leslie Knope,"So, get your wallets out or get your handkerchiefs out."
Leslie Knope,"Or get your tissues out, if you're like me and think handkerchiefs are gross."
Leslie Knope,"For now, please, let's take a look at this moving video entitled, One Butt, Two Seats: The Widening of America."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,Just stay a little while longer.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry that I've been crazy.
Leslie Knope,What did you want to talk to me about?
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Leslie Knope,Mark really loves you.
Leslie Knope,I think he's ready to take this to the next step.
Leslie Knope,I guess you're just going to have to marry him and figure it out.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Why would you do that?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Good for you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Change of plans.
Leslie Knope,Can you call me back?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, get here now."
Leslie Knope,Call me.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Hang in there.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Heads.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,What is going to happen next?
Leslie Knope,"Okay. My second favorite episode? Monica is making dinner, and Joey is mad at Chandler because Chandler made out with his girlfriend."
Leslie Knope,"So, Joey says, ""Get in the box."""
Leslie Knope,I forgot to tell you.
Leslie Knope,There's a box.
Leslie Knope,And it's Thanksgiving Day.
Leslie Knope,"So, they get ready to eat."
Leslie Knope,What is Ross and Rachel doing? They're fighting.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are all together."
Leslie Knope,"Although, is Phoebe there? Yes."
Leslie Knope,So I will now drink eight glasses of milk in three minutes.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Enough of that racket.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,It's almost 6:00 in the morning.
Leslie Knope,"And, we need to keep those donations coming in."
Leslie Knope,"I know we promised a special event coming up, andâ¦"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What we're going to do is we're going to pull our pants down.
Leslie Knope,That's what we're going to do.
Leslie Knope,Everyone's gonna pull their pants down for diabetes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay? On one, two"
Leslie Knope,"When it's for a good cause, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look who's here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Big man, big check."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I think I was a little tired when I told you that you should do that.
Leslie Knope,I don't think that that's something Ann wants.
Leslie Knope,Not on TV.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what did I do?"
Leslie Knope,"Morning, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm okay."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"Aye-aye, Captain."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I just I thought maybe you'd want to talk more about all the crazy stuff going on.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I've just got to tell you, I'm a little tired."
Leslie Knope,"So, I may have parked on your front lawn."
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, open this one. Here, I'll help you."
Leslie Knope,"Yes. This is your original intern application, your original parking pass. This is your original photo ID."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,And this is a copy of your very first paycheck.
Leslie Knope,Me. It's from me.
Leslie Knope,Happy birthday.
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's nice. I mean it can be a little sentimental to kind of frame things, but its always nice to remember the beginning of something, you know, the start. And when you--"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for God's sake."
Leslie Knope,"In the words of the great 19th century outdoorsman Jack London, you can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club."
Leslie Knope,"With those words ringing in our ears, we proudly present our plans for a new park on municipal lot 48."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,The yearly budget and planning proposal for a city is called the Master Plan.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that just so awesome you can't stand it?
Leslie Knope,"It's mostly filled with boring, bureaucratic language, so I try to spice it up a little."
Leslie Knope,"So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry rot."
Leslie Knope,"Jack London, again."
Leslie Knope,Is there too many Jack London quotes?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, you can never have enough."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm presenting it today."
Leslie Knope,"And if it flies, we are going to get our money to build a park."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it only took us 15 months to do this."
Leslie Knope,"Would've taken 13 months if you had agreed to work on weekends, but still, it's great."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the meeting's at 10:00, come over to my office for champagne after."
Leslie Knope,"Oh right, Mark. Oh, awkward."
Leslie Knope,That's not what they wrote.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I can't believe our little girl's all grown up."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn the wheel of the world."
Leslie Knope,Why must it continually turn over?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go boss. We have a meeting to go to."
Leslie Knope,Until when?
Leslie Knope,And when will that end?
Leslie Knope,"So this week, probably?"
Leslie Knope,"""In the event the master plan meeting is cut short"", ""in the event I have laryngitis and I present the master plan"", ""in the event the master plan meeting is moved onto a boat."""
Leslie Knope,Look I'm prepared for every sitautionâ¦ except for the one where there's no master plan.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, they're state auditors."
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna come to pat us on the back.
Leslie Knope,They're here to slash and burn.
Leslie Knope,"That's what government does, Ron."
Leslie Knope,It provides services.
Leslie Knope,They're going to try to eliminate everything we do.
Leslie Knope,We got to fight these guys.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right."
Leslie Knope,I'm not going to fight them.
Leslie Knope,Except that I am.
Leslie Knope,"We count backwards from 1,000 by sevens, and we think of warm brownies."
Leslie Knope,Go do it in your office.
Leslie Knope,I'll wait for you to show up.
Leslie Knope,"Relax, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,We don't know that.
Leslie Knope,Maybe these people are very helpful and pleasant.
Leslie Knope,Death!
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Deputy Director Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Would you gentlemen like a tour?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Chris is the most positive state budget auditing consultant I have ever met.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I made eye contact with him, and it was like staring into the sun."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I really like your shirt.
Leslie Knope,There is none.
Leslie Knope,He is one of the best people on the planet.
Leslie Knope,He's universally adored here.
Leslie Knope,"If you fired him, there would be a revolt."
Leslie Knope,"Well, but Chris said that you just had to, you know, tinker with things."
Leslie Knope,You're a jerk.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings."
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of history in this one.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it does.
Leslie Knope,How can you be so blase about this?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I just don't know if I can play God like that-- an angry vengeful God who just fires Jerry for no reason."
Leslie Knope,Not necessarily.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,It's just been a really crappy day.
Leslie Knope,Where were you earlier when I called?
Leslie Knope,Again?
Leslie Knope,You want to get super drunk?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Where's our lady?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Chug that, bitch!"
Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, listen to me. Listen to me, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I know I had a master plan, and it all blew up in my face, but youâ¦ You came into a town hall meeting, and we met, and we became friends, and that is awesome."
Leslie Knope,"I love you too, but I need more beer."
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Best friends of ever.
Leslie Knope,You know what's thirsty?
Leslie Knope,You know what's weird?
Leslie Knope,How thirsty I get when I'm weird.
Leslie Knope,When I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, the jerk, is here."
Leslie Knope,That one.
Leslie Knope,The one coming over here.
Leslie Knope,Get ready.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, save your breath."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Just get out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Because this is a party with my friends, and you're trying to fire all my friends."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I just talked to everybody in this bar, and nobody wants you here."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it did. You're a cold, callous person, and you want to kill people with machetes."
Leslie Knope,"And Ann is right, I should make my own plan, so that you can't hurt us, and that's what I'm gonna do."
Leslie Knope,Get out of here.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Ow.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,So it's not Jerry.
Leslie Knope,I'll keep an ear to the ground.
Leslie Knope,Why the yelling?
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, he deserves it."
Leslie Knope,"He's cold and unfeeling, and I yelled at him. So what?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't have anything to apologize for."
Leslie Knope,"All I did was express myself, forcefully, drunkenly. And I spit on him a little bit."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll go apologize."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You have a lot of bottles there.
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll take one."
Leslie Knope,"I'm here to speak to Ben, actually."
Leslie Knope,So I'd like to apologize for yesterday.
Leslie Knope,"No, what I did was out of line."
Leslie Knope,Twice.
Leslie Knope,"And I was worked up, because obviously, you represent a threat to my department."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Ben, I don't appreciate your callous attitude, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, really."
Leslie Knope,"You may hold my fate in your hands like a small bird, but I still think you're an ass."
Leslie Knope,It's like 10:30 in the morning.
Leslie Knope,Wellâ¦
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that tastes really good."
Leslie Knope,Mushy.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I yelled at you.
Leslie Knope,All three times.
Leslie Knope,But I don't think you know anything about my department.
Leslie Knope,Have you ever been part of a government body before?
Leslie Knope,Why does that sound familiar? You're Benji Wyatt?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You were so cute.
Leslie Knope,What was that song you played at the swearing-in ceremony?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"God, I was so jealous of you."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,How did you know?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You ready?
Leslie Knope,We'll talk later.
Leslie Knope,We should have a meeting to about things that happened in secret.
Leslie Knope,This suggested plan reduces our overall budget by 35%.
Leslie Knope,"And it contains very practical, deep cuts in many of our services."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Meaning what?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I just started hearing really loud circus music in my head.
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department has so many programs.
Leslie Knope,Jerry's in charge of our preteen nature hikes.
Leslie Knope,"For a while, it was a teenage nature hike, but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Smells great.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,That's bitter.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Why did you let me eat that?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,God.
Leslie Knope,I'm not an animal.
Leslie Knope,My tongue is swelling up.
Leslie Knope,Let's not scare the kids.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though."
Leslie Knope,So I have a piece of good news.
Leslie Knope,I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.
Leslie Knope,"She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,It is a classic strategy.
Leslie Knope,The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project."
Leslie Knope,The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.
Leslie Knope,"We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding."
Leslie Knope,"To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises."
Leslie Knope,One penis in particular.
Leslie Knope,"Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media."
Leslie Knope,"Rule number one, stay on message."
Leslie Knope,This is key.
Leslie Knope,"All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park."
Leslie Knope,And that's it.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Number two: What?
Leslie Knope,Stay on message again?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's that important."
Leslie Knope,It's one and two.
Leslie Knope,Stay on message and stay on message.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,"Stay on what, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark?"
Leslie Knope,Buy you a cup of coffee?
Leslie Knope,"This is JJ's Diner, the unofficial meeting place of Pawnee's political elite."
Leslie Knope,The people who eat here basically run this town.
Leslie Knope,"So, listen, I was hoping maybe I could pick your brain about how to deal with the media."
Leslie Knope,It's my first interview.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I don't count that.
Leslie Knope,That was a smear job.
Leslie Knope,So I put together some discussion topics.
Leslie Knope,Can I run them by you?
Leslie Knope,What do you think her opening gambit is gonna be?
Leslie Knope,What is she gonna ask me first?
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,"Because of the silent ""K."""
Leslie Knope,You're so smart.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now should I give her a tour of the building--"
Leslie Knope,Um Thirty.
Leslie Knope,You're insane.
Leslie Knope,Mark and I made love once.
Leslie Knope,And it was very intense.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,My ears are ringing.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I'm the deputy director of Parks and Recreation.
Leslie Knope,Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am familiar with your work."
Leslie Knope,I've read everything you've ever written.
Leslie Knope,You did an amazing in-depth article on the raccoon problem here in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Who left the door open?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,And I agree with you.
Leslie Knope,They are nature's bandits.
Leslie Knope,"So, can I give you a quick tour before we get started?"
Leslie Knope,Quick tour?
Leslie Knope,So there are 10 murals here in this hallway.
Leslie Knope,"And this is called ""The trial of Chief Wamapo."""
Leslie Knope,It was painted in 1936 and this is Chief Wamapo and he was convicted of crimes against the soldiers.
Leslie Knope,I am always amazed at his quiet dignity right before he's killed by a cannonball.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, tons of people have."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we get letters every day."
Leslie Knope,"This is Ron Swanson, our boss."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is the reporter I was telling you about."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Shauna, this is our crack team."
Leslie Knope,"Tom Haverford, boy genius."
Leslie Knope,Smooth like milk chocolate.
Leslie Knope,"April Ludgate, 19."
Leslie Knope,Cool enough to be invited anywhere and chooses to be here.
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we've got Ann Perkins and Andy Dwyer."
Leslie Knope,They're the real heroes of this story.
Leslie Knope,Ann was the citizen who brought the pit to our attention.
Leslie Knope,And Andy is the citizen who fell in it.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,That way it's verbatim.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"It's actually called a subcommittee, not a committee, so."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sure we can.
Leslie Knope,We meet at a bunch of different places.
Leslie Knope,We don't always meet here.
Leslie Knope,So I didn't quite know how to answer that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Because these are the real heroes.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna be in my office.
Leslie Knope,Such a tragedy.
Leslie Knope,Stay on message.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're so sweet and innocent and pretty.
Leslie Knope,"The press are like sharks, and you guys just dumped a bucket of chum in the water."
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, thank you for coming."
Leslie Knope,I tried to stay on message.
Leslie Knope,"But then, Ann and Andy sandbagged me."
Leslie Knope,Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit.
Leslie Knope,And it turns out that Ann is on birth control pills.
Leslie Knope,"Shauna is in the conference room, and she's writing a really bad article and it's gonna destroy us all."
Leslie Knope,Please fix it.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Disaster averted.
Leslie Knope,There's a beautiful view from over there.
Leslie Knope,This is a great place to take a shot.
Leslie Knope,"Over there as well, so I think you're fine."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no problem."
Leslie Knope,Do you live near Mark?
Leslie Knope,So he gave you a ride somehow?
Leslie Knope,"No, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to complain, but I think Shauna is being a little unprofessional."
Leslie Knope,She got here 15 minutes late. She's wearing the same dress she wore yesterday.
Leslie Knope,And she had to get a ride from--
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How big is what?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,You tell me.
Leslie Knope,How big is the lot?
Leslie Knope,A hundred or something.
Leslie Knope,Give or take 100.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Shauna Malwae-Tweep."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't I guess I don't know anything.
Leslie Knope,I have to get something from my car.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was a few years ago."
Leslie Knope,My mother got me the job.
Leslie Knope,I was qualified.
Leslie Knope,It's not like it was nepotism.
Leslie Knope,Crap on a stick.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, technically, yes, it was nepotism."
Leslie Knope,"But-- Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"No, it wasn't."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,You're home.
Leslie Knope,"I was doing an interview at the pit, and it was going really well."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was going perfect."
Leslie Knope,"But I decided to leave in the middle of it 'cause I figured I nailed it so why push it, right?"
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, just your kind of standard questions."
Leslie Knope,There was one annoying thing.
Leslie Knope,She and Mark had sex with each other.
Leslie Knope,"I wish I was, but I'm not."
Leslie Knope,They did it.
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep and Mark Brendanawicz had sex with each other last night.
Leslie Knope,Why do men have to behave like this?
Leslie Knope,Why can't they be professionals?
Leslie Knope,He doesn't like her.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should go talk to him."
Leslie Knope,Make sure that he didn't say anything to hurt the project.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mark."
Leslie Knope,May I come into your office?
Leslie Knope,I need to speak with you about something very sensitive.
Leslie Knope,Something's come to my attention that requires your attention.
Leslie Knope,It has come to my attention that you had sex with Ms. Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,It's unethical and it's irresponsible for a public servant to have sex with a member of the press corps.
Leslie Knope,Especially when you have sex with someone who is so skanky.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have sex with her and"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I can't allow that kind of behavior from someone serving on my subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is deputy director of Parks and Recreation--"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hi."
Leslie Knope,I accidentally ate an old burrito.
Leslie Knope,I was acting strange at the pit and the reason is because I had food poisoning from an old burrito.
Leslie Knope,"So, I was hoping we could have a do over interview."
Leslie Knope,Maybe over lunch.
Leslie Knope,I'm buying.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it wasn't a Mexican burrito."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the best thing on the menu."
Leslie Knope,"So, look, I feel like I may have gone a little off message at the pit."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wouldn't say weird."
Leslie Knope,"It's just, we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen."
Leslie Knope,Can I say over 100%?
Leslie Knope,Because I would be lying if I said less.
Leslie Knope,Be my guest.
Leslie Knope,"Well, until it turns into a park."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Tell that to a 14 year old girl.
Leslie Knope,There are some countries where the Pope can be married.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Have you seen The Wizard of Oz?
Leslie Knope,Leprechauns exist.
Leslie Knope,Why would you write an article about that?
Leslie Knope,That's--
Leslie Knope,Might I ask who said that?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm writing an op-ed piece about media ethics for the Pawnee Journal, so, yeah, I'm a little busy."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,It's over.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I appreciate you trying."
Leslie Knope,Would you like to be reinstated onto our subcommittee?
Leslie Knope,You'll have my answer within the month.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, can I ask you a question? You didn't really believe it when you said that the park was never gonna get made, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, subcommittee member Mark Brendanawicz."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you a lot.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the article came out, and it was a mixed bag."
Leslie Knope,"""An abandoned lot on Sullivan Street has been proposed as the site of a new park."""
Leslie Knope,That part's good.
Leslie Knope,I think we stayed on message for that part.
Leslie Knope,And then it gets a little unpleasant.
Leslie Knope,"""Pretty drunk, Ann's on the pill."""
Leslie Knope,"I didn't ""throw up,"" I spit up."
Leslie Knope,JJ's Diner gets a nice mention.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and right here."
Leslie Knope,At the end.
Leslie Knope,"She writes, and I quote, ""We'll see."""
Leslie Knope,Ends on a hopeful note.
Leslie Knope,All I can tell you is that all the parks are closed until further notice.
Leslie Knope,"Look, no one is more upset about this than I am."
Leslie Knope,Not like it's a competition or anything.
Leslie Knope,"Because if it was, I would win."
Leslie Knope,But that's neither here nor there.
Leslie Knope,The point is I would win.
Leslie Knope,One thing at a time.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to tell you.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti has been canceled.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope you're happy."
Leslie Knope,It's not a waste to provide fun for kids.
Leslie Knope,And I for one do not like having Freddy Spaghetti's blood on my hands.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Chris."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I believe there has been a casualty of war in this government shutdown, and it saddens me."
Leslie Knope,And it is Pawnee's children.
Leslie Knope,"Every year, we kick off the summer with a children's concert series."
Leslie Knope,"And this year, the concert has been canceled due to the shutdown."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very glad that you agree with me, but I actually worked really hard on my argument."
Leslie Knope,Is there any way I can still kind of... Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,You're wrong.
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,Can you put a price tag on a child's smile?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, let's talk solutions."
Leslie Knope,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is better than Idaho.
Leslie Knope,That is not your call.
Leslie Knope,This?
Leslie Knope,This isn't me.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this government shutdown.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this budget crisis.
Leslie Knope,But what I can't stand is they're canceling Freddy Spaghetti.
Leslie Knope,You know everything.
Leslie Knope,What should I do about this?
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I know I shouldn't have done that.
Leslie Knope,How could you quit?
Leslie Knope,"You know, I guess I've been mispronouncing your name all these years."
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanaquitz.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, sorry."
Leslie Knope,I need your help.
Leslie Knope,Is this a bad time?
Leslie Knope,You're about to have sex.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I just want to give you a little advice, which is don't make it last really long."
Leslie Knope,Ladies don't like that.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Just one more thing.
Leslie Knope,Are you using protection?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Less man time, more Ann time."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"The only guy that I care about right now is six feet tall with wild, crazy hair and a ukulele that doubles as a water gun."
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti.
Leslie Knope,Children's concerts aren't a priority these days.
Leslie Knope,You know what is?
Leslie Knope,Sewage.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee's kids are less important than poop tubes.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what are you going to do?"
Leslie Knope,That's the way it is.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you devious bastard."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've spent the last three hours coming up with a plan."
Leslie Knope,And I sent up the Bat Signal for all the people in the Parks Department to come and join us.
Leslie Knope,I told them to be here by 8:00.
Leslie Knope,"A, yes."
Leslie Knope,"B, even if they don't, we'll just put the concert on ourselves."
Leslie Knope,"But C, yes."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, they're definitely going to show up."
Leslie Knope,"Although, D, maybe not."
Leslie Knope,"God bless you, Jerry Gergich!"
Leslie Knope,April is here.
Leslie Knope,"Move, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,I didn't think you were going to help.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, how do you feel about lifting heavy things?"
Leslie Knope,Being a wuss?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree."
Leslie Knope,"So, go out there and get the equipment out of the truck."
Leslie Knope,You're here.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,Can you make us some more pancakes?
Leslie Knope,I don't care if you hate what we do.
Leslie Knope,I love it enough for both of us.
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put on the Freddy Spaghetti concert today, 5:00 on Lot 48."
Leslie Knope,Watch me.
Leslie Knope,"We're going to do this, Ron."
Leslie Knope,With or without you.
Leslie Knope,Hammering away.
Leslie Knope,Crank it.
Leslie Knope,Hit it.
Leslie Knope,Needs 16 minutes for premium bounce.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, after this, can you go pick up Freddy Spaghetti in your Mercedes?"
Leslie Knope,We need to give him the star treatment.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"We're so glad you're here, thanks for coming."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna put on a show today.
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna make all the problems in our town go away.
Leslie Knope,But it is gonna make a lot of people happy.
Leslie Knope,Everybody ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"All right, so-- Oh I forgot."
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a chance to get porta-potties so the audience are gonna have to use Ann's house for the bathrooms.
Leslie Knope,"Hopefully! Okay, back to work!"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish we had built one of those elevators that comes up from under the stage, you know?"
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, be cool."
Leslie Knope,Just be cool.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, though, Ben."
Leslie Knope,It's not canceled.
Leslie Knope,We're putting it on.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Because the stage is already built.
Leslie Knope,Everything was donated for free by local vendors.
Leslie Knope,Everyone here believes that what we're doing is essential.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti will sing.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti may not sing.
Leslie Knope,But something much cooler is going to happen.
Leslie Knope,I think.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Guys?
Leslie Knope,We're not giving up on this.
Leslie Knope,He's not the only musician in town.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, please."
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,"Well, just take the word ""sex"" and change it to ""pickle."""
Leslie Knope,"See, guys?"
Leslie Knope,We have a solution.
Leslie Knope,"And the good news is there's always a solution if your motives are pure, and your cause is just."
Leslie Knope,There's nothing--
Leslie Knope,How soon until he's better?
Leslie Knope,Can Mouse Rat play without you?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,I'm Renata Ricotta.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti couldn't make it today.
Leslie Knope,He bumped his noodle.
Leslie Knope,There was sauce everywhere.
Leslie Knope,It was just streaming out of his face.
Leslie Knope,It was really scary.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"If you're happy and you know it, Clap your hands, If you're happy and you know itâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I thought you were playing in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,Why did you do this?
Leslie Knope,Mean Ben has a soft spot.
Leslie Knope,"No. No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Just... Can you just stop it? Okay? Just for one moment, enjoy the fact that you provided a service for people, not a cut."
Leslie Knope,A service.
Leslie Knope,And they love it.
Leslie Knope,"And what was your favorite song, Chelsea?"
Leslie Knope,"Me, too!"
Leslie Knope,"You guys are the best, most important people in the most important government in the best city in the world."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would say see you tomorrow, butâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I called you Mark Brendana-quitz.
Leslie Knope,I got you a going away present.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Red tape.
Leslie Knope,So you'll never forget your roots.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, Pawnee's bankrupt."
Leslie Knope,I doubt I'll get to build a park anytime soon.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Morning.
Leslie Knope,Ron made me the official Parks and Rec representative for the budget discussions.
Leslie Knope,Essential personnel?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So, shall we get started?"
Leslie Knope,I have so many ideas.
Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Leslie Knope,I am the pants queen!
Leslie Knope,"Cut it out, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,We're back.
Leslie Knope,"The bankrupt government of Pawnee has been shut down all summer, so it's been three months of no work, no meetings, no memos, no late nights, nothing."
Leslie Knope,I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
Leslie Knope,"Rounding up the team, so exciting."
Leslie Knope,I have goose bumps.
Leslie Knope,Feel.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, we're back."
Leslie Knope,We're back.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"The nightmare's over, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,We're going back to work.
Leslie Knope,You're not going to need this anymore.
Leslie Knope,Come on!
Leslie Knope,"Break's over, mofos."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here's the situation.
Leslie Knope,We are operating on a shoestring budget.
Leslie Knope,Park services have been slashed.
Leslie Knope,But we are all still here.
Leslie Knope,And we have a job to do.
Leslie Knope,"No, make this town fun for the people who live here."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"See, I've spent the last few months brainstorming."
Leslie Knope,And I have some really great ideas and I put them in my idea binders.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're color coded, for God's sake."
Leslie Knope,It says here you only have money for two teams?
Leslie Knope,"Well, our budget's been slashed to zero."
Leslie Knope,I tried to buy fertilizer the other day for the soccer field.
Leslie Knope,Request denied.
Leslie Knope,We literally can't buy shit.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, when we were kids, the Parks Department would do these big projects."
Leslie Knope,"Winter Jamboree, the Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,It's like they don't have faith in us anymore.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not a paper pusher, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I need to be out in the streets, planting trees and cracking skulls."
Leslie Knope,"Not good, Chris."
Leslie Knope,There was a whole line of people in my office complaining that all their programs have been slashed.
Leslie Knope,Save it.
Leslie Knope,"I know you don't have faith in me and my department, and that's fine."
Leslie Knope,But don't expect me to sit here and chitchat with you.
Leslie Knope,Go the other way.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Did he ask you out again?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I just thought of an idea of how we can save the Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,Let me ask you one question.
Leslie Knope,Would you be cool doing things that a prostitute does?
Leslie Knope,Minus the money?
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I like what you're wearing, but I need it to be 300% sexier."
Leslie Knope,Do you have any of those shirts that look wet all the time?
Leslie Knope,You know what's always sexy?
Leslie Knope,Fingerless gloves.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but you're going to have to eat something sexy, then."
Leslie Knope,Like a banana.
Leslie Knope,"Well, what's sexy food?"
Leslie Knope,Asparagus?
Leslie Knope,"No, you know what's sexy?"
Leslie Knope,Turkey chili.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's totally easy.
Leslie Knope,Tell you what.
Leslie Knope,You be Chris.
Leslie Knope,I'll be you.
Leslie Knope,I'll show you how it's done.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris."
Leslie Knope,I'm wearing a tuxedo vest with no shirt on underneath.
Leslie Knope,I would like some wine.
Leslie Knope,"And... Oops, my vest popped open."
Leslie Knope,Just like the budget needs to pop open and you need to pour it into my Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,You're a magnificent asker-outer.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, have you asked him yet about the money?"
Leslie Knope,Jurassic Park.
Leslie Knope,Parks are so great.
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department needs money.
Leslie Knope,I just did it in three moves.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Chris and Ann, what are you two doing here?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, but I'll stay for just one drink."
Leslie Knope,"I am so happy I ran into you, because I wanted to speak to you about--"
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,I had nothing to do with this date.
Leslie Knope,They're both so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,They probably just want to see each other naked.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am."
Leslie Knope,I'm great at being sneaky.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,You know what would be really fun?
Leslie Knope,"After dinner, we should take a walk by the pond in Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, too bad the park's always closed, though."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sort of a gay hero.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, I married two penguins at the zoo, and it turned out they were both gay."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,It was so cute.
Leslie Knope,But enough about how cute it was.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you think I should have the money?
Leslie Knope,And it turned out great and everyone loved it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,I think Ice Town sounds great.
Leslie Knope,"And the point is, at least you tried something."
Leslie Knope,We're barely able to function.
Leslie Knope,We could really use that money.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,Mission accomplished.
Leslie Knope,Let's boogie.
Leslie Knope,Yeah. There's a mission that Ann had thought of.
Leslie Knope,"It was both of our ideas, but it was mostly Ann's."
Leslie Knope,We I had mentioned to Ann that it would be fun if you two went on a date.
Leslie Knope,"So, then, you could talk about the money, and then, you know, maybe give it to me."
Leslie Knope,Budget solution number 28.
Leslie Knope,Use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks.
Leslie Knope,Note.
Leslie Knope,Tired sheep could become food or sweaters.
Leslie Knope,"Okay. Well, when your back's against the wall and odds are stacked against you, you just... You... You swing the hardest, damn it."
Leslie Knope,You go big or you go home.
Leslie Knope,And you don't seem like the kind of guy who goes home.
Leslie Knope,"Go get her, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, we know the people who run this government have no faith in us."
Leslie Knope,My plan is going to change that and bring the budget back.
Leslie Knope,And the answer's been right in front of us the whole time.
Leslie Knope,No. Not that.
Leslie Knope,Although that is very good advice.
Leslie Knope,"Looking at you, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What's going to save us is right there.
Leslie Knope,"Gentlemen, I realize that times are tough and the budget is tight."
Leslie Knope,"But if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their houses and play video games, then Pawnee will die."
Leslie Knope,And we refuse to let that happen.
Leslie Knope,Now.
Leslie Knope,This town was historically known for two things.
Leslie Knope,"Widespread obesity, and the annual Pawnee Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,People from all over Indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizens were.
Leslie Knope,"And while they were here, they would also attend the Festival, a full week of corn mazes, hay rides, Ferris wheels, pumpkins the size ofjeeps."
Leslie Knope,"We lost that festival a few years ago, due to another round of budget cuts."
Leslie Knope,And I propose we bring the festival back.
Leslie Knope,"With ticket sales and corporate sponsorship, we'll earn all that money back."
Leslie Knope,"And believe me, people will come."
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you eliminate the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we're not just pencil pushers."
Leslie Knope,We are a reflection of the community.
Leslie Knope,And we believe that we can strengthen that community.
Leslie Knope,"Because in the end, the reason why we're all here is to bring people together."
Leslie Knope,Excellent! Great! Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, we're going to party hard for 15 minutes and then, we're going to have our first brainstorming session."
Leslie Knope,"So, JJ, we wanted to talk to you about the Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, I haven't been feeling myself."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm organizing this huge Harvest Festival and I need at least 80 local businesses to participate."
Leslie Knope,And normally this is the kind of thing I would love to do.
Leslie Knope,"But, I'm just feeling really tired."
Leslie Knope,I think maybe my allergies are acting up.
Leslie Knope,"I've already vomited, like, five times today."
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting tonight at the Chamber of Commerce and we're going to go over all the details.
Leslie Knope,And we'd just love if you could come and join us.
Leslie Knope,I bet you say that to all the girls.
Leslie Knope,"So, we've developed a revenue sharing formula that will hopefully appeal to most business owners, but--"
Leslie Knope,I'm not sick.
Leslie Knope,It's just allergies.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,Just let me in there.
Leslie Knope,You look tired and you're all sweaty all the time.
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?
Leslie Knope,"You want to go there, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'm coming in."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, come on."
Leslie Knope,Just let me in.
Leslie Knope,I'm not going home.
Leslie Knope,"No, we do."
Leslie Knope,It's just I think it's a little chilly in here.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I am not sick.
Leslie Knope,"I just have allergies, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I took a Claritin and I threw that up, so I took another one."
Leslie Knope,I threw that up.
Leslie Knope,"And then, I took a third and it stayed down."
Leslie Knope,I'm getting better.
Leslie Knope,You're burning up.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, I can't."
Leslie Knope,I can't go home.
Leslie Knope,I have to get ready for the Chamber of Secrets.
Leslie Knope,"If this meeting does not go perfectly, then the Harvest Festival is going to be over before it begins."
Leslie Knope,I cannot go home.
Leslie Knope,Ann's my doctor.
Leslie Knope,And she's the most beautiful nurse in the world.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm hot."
Leslie Knope,"Now, it's really hot in here."
Leslie Knope,"If I was sick, could I do this?"
Leslie Knope,Cartwheels.
Leslie Knope,Am I not doing them?
Leslie Knope,It's not that I don't trust Ben.
Leslie Knope,It's that I don't have faith in Ben.
Leslie Knope,"And, also, I'm starting to forget who Ben is."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, let's talk about your opening remarks."
Leslie Knope,Do you want me to write you a rap?
Leslie Knope,I'll write you a rap.
Leslie Knope,"No, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,You're never going to be able to pull it off.
Leslie Knope,You're too white.
Leslie Knope,How about a show tune or something?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No ""blah, blah, blah"", okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Now, get some rest."
Leslie Knope,I have some great news.
Leslie Knope,I think my fever just broke.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,That flu medicine really helped.
Leslie Knope,I feel a thousand percent better.
Leslie Knope,Good as new.
Leslie Knope,Does this scarf look okay?
Leslie Knope,I don't want to look stuffy.
Leslie Knope,"But I also don't want to look too ""schlubby""."
Leslie Knope,So no to the scarf?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm going to that meeting."
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt!
Leslie Knope,Hello!
Leslie Knope,Good to see you.
Leslie Knope,"Can I get some money for the cab that I took over here, please?"
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,"I looked at the meter, and it had Egyptian hieroglyphics on it."
Leslie Knope,Do you know the exchange rate?
Leslie Knope,So should we do this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,Be careful.
Leslie Knope,The floor and the wall just switched.
Leslie Knope,Walk very carefully.
Leslie Knope,"It's not that I don't trust you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,It's just this Harvest Festival is my project.
Leslie Knope,It's my career on the line.
Leslie Knope,And I just need to make sure that I've done everything I can to make it work.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's show time.
Leslie Knope,"Good evening, everyone."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Monster.
Leslie Knope,And this is Nightline.
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, I'm ready."
Leslie Knope,Get up there and introduce me.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this ain't your call, McCluskey."
Leslie Knope,"Every one of you, just by showing up here tonight, has already made history."
Leslie Knope,"In days past, the Harvest Festival was the cornerstone of Pawnee's smallbusiness community, a weeklong showcase for everything from textiles to small farms."
Leslie Knope,"By our estimates, as many as 30,000 people might attend the festival, and the monetary value of that kind of direct customer-to-business exposure is, frankly, incalculable."
Leslie Knope,The time is now.
Leslie Knope,The place is Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Let's make history.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Any questions? Yes sir?
Leslie Knope,"That's a very good question, sir, and I would counter with my own question, which is, why is half of your face all swirly?"
Leslie Knope,"Give it up, everybody, for Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap."
Leslie Knope,"Was I wearing a tiara when I came in here? Because if you happen upon it, will you have Lady Pennyface retrieve it and send it post-hence?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,I'll take the waffles.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,So how did the rest of the meeting go?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Nice work to you too.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, what have you chosen to put in the time capsule?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Better than good, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, you're up."
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,And I am submitting this.
Leslie Knope,A brief history of everything that has ever happened since Pawnee was founded.
Leslie Knope,"Not like you get extra credit for this, but I did type it from memory."
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time ever compiled, it includes a complete list of every official town slogan we've ever had."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Can you believe it?
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The Paris of America."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The Akron of Southwest Indiana."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Welcome, German soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"After the Nazis took France, our mayor kind of panicked."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The factory fire capital of America."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Welcome, Vietnamese soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Engage with Zorp."""
Leslie Knope,"For a brief time in the '70s, our town was taken over by a cult."
Leslie Knope,Zorp is dead.
Leslie Knope,Long live Zorp.
Leslie Knope,It's safe to be here now.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Birthplace of Julia Roberts."""
Leslie Knope,"That was a lie, she sued, and so we had to change it."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Home of the world-famous Julia Roberts lawsuit."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Welcome, Taliban soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"And finally, our current slogan."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""First in friendship, fourth in obesity."""
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Pawnee has had its set of problems, but this time capsule is our way of saying that Pawnee is gonna be around for a long time Capsule."
Leslie Knope,And you can quote me on that.
Leslie Knope,I thought of a great headline.
Leslie Knope,"""It's Time to Encapsulate the Future."""
Leslie Knope,"Sub headline, ""The Parks Department Cuts the Crapsule, Buries the Time Capsule."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Can I help you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,We're not taking Twilight books.
Leslie Knope,You are the person that's been emailing me about Twilight.
Leslie Knope,I thought you would be younger.
Leslie Knope,And a girl.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, Kelly."
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,And plead your case.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,You're going all the way back to her birth.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, I have not."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Kelly, this time capsule isn't just a barrel full of stuff that people like."
Leslie Knope,"It's about life in Pawnee at this moment in time, and there is nothing in Twilight that is specific to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I have to say no.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Leslie Knope,He brought handcuffs with him.
Leslie Knope,This whole thing was planned.
Leslie Knope,It's not cool.
Leslie Knope,"It's trespassing, and that is breaking the rules."
Leslie Knope,Cool people make the rules.
Leslie Knope,They don't break the rules.
Leslie Knope,"And if those kids want you to break the rules, they're not really your friends."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm just annoyed.
Leslie Knope,"But while we're on the subject, your friend Orrin, with the long black nails and the cloak?"
Leslie Knope,He concerns me.
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna call security.
Leslie Knope,Some guy handcuffed himself to a pipe in my office because we wouldn't put a copy of Twilight in the time capsule.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, buddy, time is up."
Leslie Knope,Give us the keys.
Leslie Knope,Then we're gonna have to cut you loose.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,You're trespassing.
Leslie Knope,"Go ahead, Artie."
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"If he wants to stay in there, I'll let him stay in there."
Leslie Knope,"In two hours, he's gonna be so hungry and freaked out, he's gonna be begging me to-- He brought a pillow."
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess it's kind of interesting."
Leslie Knope,"What the real story is is how wonderful our time capsule is and how it perfectly encapsulates, a word I really think you should use, what our town is all about."
Leslie Knope,"God, that's an amazing headline, but please don't write that story."
Leslie Knope,"Can you please, please be quiet?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go do my work in the conference room, 'cause you guys are the worst."
Leslie Knope,Read Twilight?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks."
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Kelly."
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,Did you have a nice night?
Leslie Knope,Sleep well?
Leslie Knope,Picked you up some coffee.
Leslie Knope,"I am, Kelly, because I know why you're here."
Leslie Knope,You know what I did last night?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I read the first 10 pages."
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't really get into it, though."
Leslie Knope,More of a Harry Potter girl myself.
Leslie Knope,"But I looked in the inside cover, and I saw this."
Leslie Knope,"Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straight-A student at King Philip Middle."
Leslie Knope,"She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter?"
Leslie Knope,Is that why you did this?
Leslie Knope,To impress your daughter?
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.
Leslie Knope,You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.
Leslie Knope,I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.
Leslie Knope,"Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I can get Shauna on board."
Leslie Knope,It would make a great human interest story.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, that's a good point."
Leslie Knope,Then we shall bring the pipe to them.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."
Leslie Knope,So that's what today's forum is for.
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna hear suggestions from everyone, and then whichever items we generally agree on will go into the time capsule."
Leslie Knope,"Please remember, this is a government project, so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious items."
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"So, we have one very moving case for Twilight."
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Two people for Twilight.
Leslie Knope,"Well, now we have two people for Twilight."
Leslie Knope,"So too Christian, and not Christian enough?"
Leslie Knope,Do you see the irony here?
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Donna, why don't you put a question mark next to Twilight?"
Leslie Knope,And who else?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think if we're gonna be adding a book to the time capsule, it would probably be Twilight."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,Two time capsules.
Leslie Knope,"One that totally encapsulates what's happening right now in Pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that's just for items of personal significance, like Twilight."
Leslie Knope,"For the last time, and I won't say this again, there will be no human or feline ashes in either one of the time capsules."
Leslie Knope,No chanting.
Leslie Knope,So what's your suggestion?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think pet paintings/ ashes are in time capsule four."
Leslie Knope,"No, baseball cards are in time capsule nine, childhood memorabilia."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a 10-minute break! Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,This time capsule's tearing this town apart.
Leslie Knope,You're leaving soon.
Leslie Knope,Can I blame it on you in the press?
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"I realize things have gotten a little out of control, and that's Ben's fault, and he's sorry."
Leslie Knope,"But I have an idea, and if you like it, I think we can end this right now."
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Pawnee of the future, congratulations."""
Leslie Knope,"""You have found a time capsule that was buried over 50 years ago."""
Leslie Knope,"""We wanted to include a collection of items that would best represent what life was like in our town at that moment."""
Leslie Knope,"""Instead, you'll find only one item, a video recording of a public forum we held in order to determine just what those items would be."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is truly what life was like."""
Leslie Knope,"""A lot of people with a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in."""
Leslie Knope,"""So enjoy watching it, assuming you still have electricity."""
Leslie Knope,"""And sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle."""
Leslie Knope,"""A man named Jerry Gergich screwed up the recording somehow."""
Leslie Knope,"""He had one job to do."""
Leslie Knope,"""Sincerely, Pawnee of the past."""
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Ooh! Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I pre-dialed 911, so all you have to do is press send."
Leslie Knope,"If she binds your hands and you can't reach your phone, just try to chew yourself free."
Leslie Knope,Whale tail.
Leslie Knope,Whale tail.
Leslie Knope,She's flashing a whale tail.
Leslie Knope,Abort.
Leslie Knope,Abort.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, she's amazing."
Leslie Knope,Good Good day.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so we're ordering them a total of 30 pizzas, so let's talk toppings."
Leslie Knope,Nice.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Ben, these guys are cops, not ballerinas."
Leslie Knope,So we are throwing a little shindig for the police department because we're asking them to volunteer as security during the Harvest Festival.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know what it is about big outdoor gatherings that makes everyone want to urinate all over everything, but it does."
Leslie Knope,And they do.
Leslie Knope,Calzones are like pizzas but they're harder to eat.
Leslie Knope,"They're dumb, and so was that idea."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I know exactly when we should do it.
Leslie Knope,"Post-pizza, pre-ice cream, between his third and fourth beer."
Leslie Knope,"He'll be full but not stuffed, tipsy but not drunk."
Leslie Knope,Should be around 9:00.
Leslie Knope,Just sit tight.
Leslie Knope,I'll get you a beer.
Leslie Knope,"Can I have two beers, please?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm gonna tell you what I tell all my girlfriends when they get dumped."
Leslie Knope,Men are dogs.
Leslie Knope,Chief Trumple?
Leslie Knope,You know Ben Wyatt from the State Budget Office.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,We'll check in with you later.
Leslie Knope,Take it easy.
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, great small talk over there."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let me handle this."
Leslie Knope,I'm in control.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, what the hell are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,I know Tammy seems scary.
Leslie Knope,"But really, she's just a manipulative, psychotic, library book peddling, sex crazed shedemon."
Leslie Knope,"I know why you're doing this, and you're making a huge mistake."
Leslie Knope,Ron and Wendy aren't even dating anymore.
Leslie Knope,She's moving back to Canada.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hey."
Leslie Knope,What's happening here?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Swanson!"
Leslie Knope,Snap out of it!
Leslie Knope,What the hell happened to you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, I completely understand."
Leslie Knope,"Chief, I need to ask you a huge favor."
Leslie Knope,Ron is a good man who just got caught up in something terrible.
Leslie Knope,And I was hoping that maybe you would reduce his charges and release him into my custody.
Leslie Knope,I'll do my best.
Leslie Knope,That's good advice for all of us.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, stop."
Leslie Knope,"For the millionth time, no."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out later.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Ron Swanson, this is an intervention."
Leslie Knope,You have been spending the last 24 hours sipping on joy juice and tripping on Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the people in this room are your methadone."
Leslie Knope,And we're here to get you clean.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, what is this?"
Leslie Knope,This is an intervention.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's begin."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sit down."
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Powerful stuff.
Leslie Knope,That was you on the tape.
Leslie Knope,That was you talking.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"God, please."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, don't do that."
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,I hope you're happy.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you did a really crappy thing, and I think deep down, you know that."
Leslie Knope,Whatever happens to Ron Swanson is on you.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Sorry about the whole mess.
Leslie Knope,"The crisis has been averted, so let's go talk to the chief."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,What a relief.
Leslie Knope,"You know, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"There's a really great calzone place over in ""Idiotville."""
Leslie Knope,"Down on ""Terrible Idea Avenue."""
Leslie Knope,Calzones are pointless.
Leslie Knope,They're just pizza that's harder to eat.
Leslie Knope,No one likes them.
Leslie Knope,"Good day, sir."
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Boy, 35%?"
Leslie Knope,"""34.2%"""
Leslie Knope,"I'm Ben, the numbers robot."
Leslie Knope,"So, we're doing a huge media blitz to publicize the Harvest Festival, and we've got TV, newspaper, radio. And I even called Oprah."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I tried to call Oprah."
Leslie Knope,I couldn't get her number.
Leslie Knope,"I'm putting it out there, like The Secret."
Leslie Knope,"And hopefully, she'll call me."
Leslie Knope,Our first interview is at 93.7 FM with Crazy Ira and The Douche.
Leslie Knope,They are Pawnee's most hilarious drive time radio guys.
Leslie Knope,They're seriously so funny.
Leslie Knope,"Well, The Douche, it's a Pawnee tradition, and it's where fun meets awesome."
Leslie Knope,Meets agriculture.
Leslie Knope,"And it is going to be next month, right here in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"And spoiler alert, it's going to have the best corn maze ever."
Leslie Knope,There's also going to be hay rides.
Leslie Knope,There's also going to be ponies at the Harvest Festival.
Leslie Knope,No worries.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it was just a bump in the road."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Fortunately, the Lesliemobile is an all terrain vehicle."
Leslie Knope,"So, everything involving Ben is fine."
Leslie Knope,I just need to talk to you in private about something different that is not Ben related.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, good job."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but we need him."
Leslie Knope,"If they ask us about the budget, he's our numbers guy."
Leslie Knope,I'll do the newspaper interview.
Leslie Knope,You and Ben do Channel Four.
Leslie Knope,Perd Hapley is a big softie.
Leslie Knope,It'll be a puff piece.
Leslie Knope,He can do it.
Leslie Knope,This just in.
Leslie Knope,"Harvest Festival more like ""Harvest Bestival."""
Leslie Knope,"The Parks Department has planted the seeds, and now, they're harvesting the rewards."
Leslie Knope,They'll put the fun in funnel cake.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm done."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"He works for the state government, and he's been coming to advise us about our budget."
Leslie Knope,"There's no story here, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,He's just a dedicated civil servant who is doing whatever he can to make sure that this is the best Harvest Festival ever.
Leslie Knope,"And he's easy on the eyes, too."
Leslie Knope,Strictly professional.
Leslie Knope,Just friends.
Leslie Knope,We are colleagues with benefits.
Leslie Knope,We're colleagues who benefit from the fact that we're also friends.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,I think I need to go.
Leslie Knope,"But, thank you so much, and as always, everything I said is off the record."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,How did it go?
Leslie Knope,How did this happen?
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,You look psychotic.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,Call me.
Leslie Knope,That should be some damage control.
Leslie Knope,I'm having dinner with Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, what do we have?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, we need to focus."
Leslie Knope,We still have the Pawnee Today interview.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's too late to cancel.
Leslie Knope,Joan Callamezzo runs this town.
Leslie Knope,"But Ben, don't worry about it."
Leslie Knope,You're not going in front of the camera.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Joan, actually, there's a lot of false information flying around."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is--
Leslie Knope,I just want everyone to know what an extraordinary event this is going to be.
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt has done nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope,You know?
Leslie Knope,"If you want to ask him questions, let's go for it, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Just ask any question about his past or present.
Leslie Knope,Just get it over with.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, let's get up here."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"We'll just ask him a bunch of questions, and then, we'll get everything cleared and out of the way."
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Let's take some calls, Joan."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Caller, are you there?"
Leslie Knope,"Just to add to what Ben's stammering about, we aren't going to raise taxes."
Leslie Knope,"So, that's that."
Leslie Knope,Next caller?
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,"What else you got, callers? Going once, going... Here we go."
Leslie Knope,I can't look away.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Now, after we are given the certificate, who do you think should speak first?"
Leslie Knope,I think it should be me and then you.
Leslie Knope,"But, if you want, it could be you and then me."
Leslie Knope,"Or it could go me, you, me."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, the Parks and Rec Department is receiving a commendation at the Indiana Statehouse for bringing the Harvest Festival back."
Leslie Knope,"And although it's purely ceremonial, it's a huge deal for me to go to the Statehouse."
Leslie Knope,"She's showing some elephant-- Ooh, la la."
Leslie Knope,Look who's fancy.
Leslie Knope,Don't let us picture that.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you gonna go?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, I want you to take Ben and make him go to that anti-histamine party."
Leslie Knope,He doesn't know anybody in town.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Tom, take him under your tiny little wing."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, while you're doing that, I want you to picture Ben in his motel room, all by himself with no friends, staring at the wall."
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,This?
Leslie Knope,"But does it say, ""Hello, general assembly, I've come to Indianapolis to accept your commendation?"""
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That lying bastard!
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,How do you know?
Leslie Knope,Then I'm sure he's not cheating on you.
Leslie Knope,"And if he is, he's a monster."
Leslie Knope,"And if he's not, you guys are great together."
Leslie Knope,"But if he is, I will kill him."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it sounds like you're just spiraling."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, luckily, I'm heading up there."
Leslie Knope,I'll invite him out to dinner and I'll poke around a little bit.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not gonna be able to keep anything from me."
Leslie Knope,"In high school, they used to call me Angela Lansbury."
Leslie Knope,But that was because of my haircut.
Leslie Knope,"If you would be willing to just take a brief pit stop, we could see Indiana's second largest rocking chair."
Leslie Knope,Then maybe we should take a quick two hour sojourn to Dame Gervin's Misshapen Celebrity Castle.
Leslie Knope,"It's where Madame Tussaud sends all of its failed wax figures, and if you can figure out who it is, you get to take it home."
Leslie Knope,"What's wrong with you, grouchy pants?"
Leslie Knope,"Fasting's not healthy for you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I forgot to tell you, Chris Traeger is joining us for dinner tonight."
Leslie Knope,"No, we are picking him up."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Look at your foyer.
Leslie Knope,It's like a spa in here.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ron doesn't even have a front door.
Leslie Knope,He won't even tell me his address.
Leslie Knope,Ask him where he lives.
Leslie Knope,So this is some kind of coat closet or something?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, there's a lot of men's coats in here."
Leslie Knope,Could I use your bathroom really quick?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Toilet seat's up.
Leslie Knope,Just one second.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I think you might be right."
Leslie Knope,I found a woman's razor in Chris's shower and a pink swimming cap.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it could be nothing, but it feels like something."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"All right, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it looks like they're closed for some kind of health code violation."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, stop it!"
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,You sure you're not expecting company or something?
Leslie Knope,"So, Chris, do you have any sisters?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,So how's your mom?
Leslie Knope,Is she visiting?
Leslie Knope,Any aunts?
Leslie Knope,Girl cousins?
Leslie Knope,"A youthful grandmother, perhaps?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna kill him, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Chris is cheating on Ann.
Leslie Knope,There's evidence everywhere.
Leslie Knope,She's coming up here so they can have it out.
Leslie Knope,"So, Chris, what do you do up here in your spare time?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's what you call it."
Leslie Knope,How are things going with Ann?
Leslie Knope,You know what's funny about Ann?
Leslie Knope,"She's my best friend, and anyone who hurt her is someone I would murder, probably."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann, if you get this, I don't know if you should come up here."
Leslie Knope,"He's not worth it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Call me, let me know where you are, and if you have Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay."
Leslie Knope,Could you get us a cold compress or something?
Leslie Knope,"Look, we'll find a 24 hour diner."
Leslie Knope,Or we can get one of those cows that we saw on the way up here and we'll bring it back and we'll make steaks out of that.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I found concealer in your medicine cabinet."
Leslie Knope,What's that about?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so here's what happened."
Leslie Knope,"Sweet and beautiful Ann has never been dumped before, and Chris is such a positive person, when he broke up with her, she just didn't realize it."
Leslie Knope,It's kind of understandable.
Leslie Knope,Although it does kind of make you wonder how good of a nurse she is.
Leslie Knope,"One time, when I was in high school, a guy's mom called me and broke up with me for him."
Leslie Knope,There was another time where I was on a date and I tripped and broke my kneecap.
Leslie Knope,"And then the guy said he wasn't ""feeling it,"" so he left and I waited for an ambulance."
Leslie Knope,"One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me to never call him again."
Leslie Knope,One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.
Leslie Knope,Skywriting isn't always positive.
Leslie Knope,"Another time, a guy invited me to a beautiful picnic with wine and flowers, and then, when I tried to sit down, he said, ""Don't eat anything."""
Leslie Knope,"""Rebecca's coming."""
Leslie Knope,And then he broke up with me.
Leslie Knope,Yeah. Exactly.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, please."
Leslie Knope,It's just a goofy ceremony.
Leslie Knope,I don't even care about it.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, Ron is staying behind."
Leslie Knope,He'll go.
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look who's socializing!"
Leslie Knope,Sit with us.
Leslie Knope,Ann's in kind of a crappy mood because Chris dumped her.
Leslie Knope,Are you okay? Is it that bad?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,And I am so proud of all of you.
Leslie Knope,You've worked so hard.
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have a surprise."
Leslie Knope,"And it is possibly the best thing to potentially ever happen to anyone, anywhere, in the history of the universe."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the world famous Little Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Little Sebastian made his debut at the last Harvest Festival in 1987, and he was an instant phenomenon."
Leslie Knope,That week he was the eighth most photographed object in America.
Leslie Knope,"So suck it, the Alamo."
Leslie Knope,We all need to be very careful.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Remember.
Leslie Knope,This little guy is 25 now.
Leslie Knope,And he has cataracts in both eyes.
Leslie Knope,He has severe arthritis.
Leslie Knope,Jerry's going to look after him.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it amazing?
Leslie Knope,Get out.
Leslie Knope,On Deep Fried Boulevard?
Leslie Knope,"Well, we want to make money, not make people hate themselves."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, I'm sorry, you know what we'll do, we'll make Sue's Salads the official healthy choice of the festival."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, nobody's going to come to your stupid booth anyway."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is the biggest thing I've ever done in my career.
Leslie Knope,"And if it fails, the Parks Department will be eliminated."
Leslie Knope,That's why we're going big.
Leslie Knope,"Seven days, over 30 different locations, 50,000 plus visitors and four hospitality kiosks."
Leslie Knope,"God, I've got to stop ending on that boring thing."
Leslie Knope,Clowns.
Leslie Knope,"No you cannot sell home-brewed water, and no I would not like to taste it."
Leslie Knope,"April, who's next?"
Leslie Knope,"No, Star Wars is not that nerdy."
Leslie Knope,Everyone has seen it.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ken."
Leslie Knope,This is Ben and Tom.
Leslie Knope,This is Ken Hotate.
Leslie Knope,He is the tribal leader of the Wamapoke.
Leslie Knope,"I just said, hello honored guest. Although literally translated it means may you be blessed with a million possums."
Leslie Knope,The Wamapoke used to use possums as currency.
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I know why you're here."
Leslie Knope,And just let me say that we really tried.
Leslie Knope,"The carnival is on the site of the Battle of Indian Hill, which was an epic seven day battle that the Wamapoke lost due to the fact that they didn't have any weapons."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I understand, but this is the only place in town that's big enough to house the carnival rides."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you know with Pawnee's history, it's very difficult to not be offensive."
Leslie Knope,This is a map of all the atrocities the Pawnee settlers inflicted upon the Wamapoke Indians.
Leslie Knope,The atrocities are in blue.
Leslie Knope,"We put up a memorial plaque, and we have a Wamapoke exhibit in the history tent."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse."
Leslie Knope,"Ow, ow, ow!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so guys, focus up."
Leslie Knope,"Joan Callamezzo is coming by with a camera crew for an exclusive, last minute walkthrough of the Harvest Festival before we open tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"So, everything needs to be perfect."
Leslie Knope,Joan is always looking for a scandal.
Leslie Knope,She's like an eagleeyed tiger.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, gather around."
Leslie Knope,Let's grab hands.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You're all amazing, wonderful people."
Leslie Knope,"And I really want you to have fun today and not focus on the fact that if one thing goes wrong, we're all going to lose our jobs."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go get them, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Any concerns, address them to Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Joan."
Leslie Knope,You remember Ben.
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the festival is spread throughout the town, but the centerpiece is the carnival."
Leslie Knope,And over here is Indiana's largest corn maze.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee corn.
Leslie Knope,And it's organic.
Leslie Knope,"Over here, we have our beautiful Ferris wheel."
Leslie Knope,None.
Leslie Knope,They're all U.S citizens.
Leslie Knope,"Over in this booth, Indiana basketball legend Larry Bird's Aunt Tilda will be signing autographs for two hours on Thursday."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We got Tilda.
Leslie Knope,But the real coup is over there.
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,See for yourself.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,He is so adorable.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Joan, this festival, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is going to bring people nothing but happiness."
Leslie Knope,Not even I could screw that up.
Leslie Knope,"Come on down, everyone."
Leslie Knope,It's going to be sweet.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That went well.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It did.
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Yes this is bad.
Leslie Knope,This is like a poop tornado. This is like a poop-nado.
Leslie Knope,This is way worse than that.
Leslie Knope,"This is a huge government project, and it's already a lightning rod."
Leslie Knope,"And then, you add the Wamapoke controversy."
Leslie Knope,Double lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,It's a mini-horse.
Leslie Knope,And that's the third lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,Triple lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you have the curse."
Leslie Knope,Quadruple lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,It's a classic four-rod distaster.
Leslie Knope,"God, now all the vendors are going to bail, and the ticket sales will go down."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is an incredibly superstitious town. A travelling magician came through one time and he pulled a rabbit out of a hat, and the mob burned him at the stake for being a witch."
Leslie Knope,The year was 1973.
Leslie Knope,No comment.
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""No comment""?"
Leslie Knope,"You've got to say ""No comment."""
Leslie Knope,"Good, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Well, just treat him and release him, and then, don't say anything to anyone about anything for the rest of the month."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Run, Ann, run!"
Leslie Knope,None of that happened.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,What we do is we move the shooting gallery.
Leslie Knope,That seems to be their biggest problem.
Leslie Knope,Maybe that will make them happy.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'd like to start by addressing some of the false rumors about the festival.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, we have plenty of food."
Leslie Knope,There is no food shortage.
Leslie Knope,"There are not, as one reporter suggested, dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival."
Leslie Knope,"And at no time was any Parks Department worker, quote, ""feasting on petting zoo animals."""
Leslie Knope,It will not be a disaster.
Leslie Knope,It will be a success.
Leslie Knope,"And I want to let everyone know that, in an attempt to be sensitive to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved the shooting gallery, per their request."
Leslie Knope,"So, yes, Perd."
Leslie Knope,"Perd, you know as well as I do that there's no such God."
Leslie Knope,Crap on a spatula.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Please, we'll get this up and running in no time."
Leslie Knope,We cannot catch a break.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I got the T.M.K. 2500 specifically for the extra capacity.
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ed."
Leslie Knope,How could that happen?
Leslie Knope,I knew it. Stupid media.
Leslie Knope,"Let me tell you something, freedom of press is for the birds."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"How and where can I get a new one in, like, I don't know, now?"
Leslie Knope,You've got to be kidding me.
Leslie Knope,This festival was supposed to be my love letter to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Now it's just turned into a note that say I want to see other people.
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I am coming to you on my knees, begging for help, much like the early settlers of Pawnee begged the Wamapoke--"
Leslie Knope,"A trick, and over 50 Wamapoke were slaughtered."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but this is not a trick."
Leslie Knope,"I am prepared to put the Wamapoke history exhibit inside the carnival grounds, right past the entrance turnstile, so that you have to look at it before you start having fun."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just trying to do something good for this town, and I'm trying to save my friends' jobs."
Leslie Knope,Can you help me out here?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ken."
Leslie Knope,"Well, actually, I have another idea."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Intense stuff from Ken Hotate.
Leslie Knope,"And in other good news, he gave us a scare, but he's back now."
Leslie Knope,"The one, the only, Little Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,Welcome.
Leslie Knope,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,Have fun.
Leslie Knope,"Enjoy yourself, ladies."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Look who's back.
Leslie Knope,"Ice Town was a disaster, and it seems like it was probably your fault."
Leslie Knope,"From what I can tell, you mismanaged the hell out of it."
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, this project, this is as much yours as it is mine."
Leslie Knope,"It's ours, and it's going to be really great."
Leslie Knope,And I'm glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,Yes. This is him.
Leslie Knope,Special Wamapoke ceremony.
Leslie Knope,The curse has been lifted.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Gosh, you're filthy."
Leslie Knope,Go clean yourself up.
Leslie Knope,Try to look professional.
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Enjoy yourselves.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I like your necklace.
Leslie Knope,"You finally get it now, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ben, you just missed it! He whinnied!"
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Oh, my gosh."
Leslie Knope,Holy!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Call 911!
Leslie Knope,That was the second most awkward way a man has ever grabbed my breast.
Leslie Knope,"All right, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, listen up."
Leslie Knope,Just a few notes about our camping retreat tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,We're all gonna meet here and leave as a group at 6:45 a.m. promptly.
Leslie Knope,Harvest Fest is over.
Leslie Knope,We do not wanna have a sophomore slump.
Leslie Knope,This camping trip is our chance to think of some really big ideas.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have ideas, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"I have, like, 100 new ideas."
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, the pressure is on."
Leslie Knope,We only have one chance to make a second impression.
Leslie Knope,All of it.
Leslie Knope,Can't pass.
Leslie Knope,It's a mandatory work retreat.
Leslie Knope,My boob does not kill.
Leslie Knope,Paul did not die.
Leslie Knope,"He had a heart attack, which required an octuple bypass."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, the Pawnee Sun said that my chest saved his life."
Leslie Knope,"Well, there was an ex that I still liked after he broke up with me."
Leslie Knope,But it was really hard to stay mad at him.
Leslie Knope,He was an amazing dentist.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Do not read into this.
Leslie Knope,"Remember, this is the guy that was so upbeat and positive, when he broke up with you, you didn't even know it happened."
Leslie Knope,Come camping with us.
Leslie Knope,It'll be really fun.
Leslie Knope,You'll be away from Chris.
Leslie Knope,You can brainstorm.
Leslie Knope,I'll give you first dibs on s'mores.
Leslie Knope,Here is our official retreat schedule.
Leslie Knope,It divides our time evenly between work and play.
Leslie Knope,"Great attitude, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"We need big ideas, and we need 'em now."
Leslie Knope,Who wants to go first?
Leslie Knope,"So, how much would that be per person?"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to tell us any more?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Ben helped us launch the Harvest Festival, and he knows how Chris's mind works."
Leslie Knope,And he's a valuable asset to the team.
Leslie Knope,April has not presented her idea.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I am really disappointed in all of you.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the whole town is looking at us right now."
Leslie Knope,And you're letting 'em down.
Leslie Knope,Take an hour.
Leslie Knope,Go clear your heads and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use.
Leslie Knope,"And also, see if you're interested in contributing to this department."
Leslie Knope,"Then, after that, I will tell you my idea."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I had no choice."
Leslie Knope,I didn't wanna tell them my idea.
Leslie Knope,Because I don't have one.
Leslie Knope,"I don't have an idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so screwed, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"The meeting is tomorrow, and I don't have anything."
Leslie Knope,Chris wants the new project to generate revenue.
Leslie Knope,They're filled with small ideas.
Leslie Knope,"We need a big, juicy idea."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so desperate, I even brought in my dream journal, hoping it would inspire me."
Leslie Knope,It was.
Leslie Knope,You're probably right.
Leslie Knope,I just need an hour and it'll come to me.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You wanna go for a walk?
Leslie Knope,It's pollution from the Sweetums factory.
Leslie Knope,"It's gorgeous, but is it worth the asthma?"
Leslie Knope,"Ben, this new project idea, it's not really a big deal."
Leslie Knope,I'm probably making too much out of it.
Leslie Knope,"What if the festival was, like, a high point for me, and I never do anything better than that?"
Leslie Knope,"So, I have to keep thinking about good ideas all the time, or I'm no longer myself?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,Listen up.
Leslie Knope,That was me talking.
Leslie Knope,Super great.
Leslie Knope,Really well.
Leslie Knope,We have a great idea.
Leslie Knope,Here it is.
Leslie Knope,What do you think? I don't have an idea.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I thought if we all worked really hard, I could come up with something."
Leslie Knope,"But I don't have anything, and we're totally screwed."
Leslie Knope,And what we need to do is just keep working and just work again more and just do it and get it.
Leslie Knope,And then we got it and we're good.
Leslie Knope,Go with that.
Leslie Knope,You're not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,No one's going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,No one's sleeping because this is an all-nighter.
Leslie Knope,And that'll be fun.
Leslie Knope,"We'll all stay up and then, I'll be like, ""Hey! No one sleep!"" Do you hear how loud that is? You're not sleeping through that."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this is a sign."
Leslie Knope,"You wanted to leave, and now you're stuck here with me."
Leslie Knope,"So, we can work all night."
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so much fun! All night work! All night work! All night work!
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Let's keep brainstorming.
Leslie Knope,I have a good feeling about this B&B.
Leslie Knope,"One day, there's gonna be a plaque there that reads, ""This is where Leslie Knope came up with the amazing idea for"" Damn, I thought that would work."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, couldn't sleep?"
Leslie Knope,Sounds delightful.
Leslie Knope,"I am listening to ""Steal My Sunshine"" by Len, a one-hit wonder like me."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will be."
Leslie Knope,"I peaked at the Harvest Festival, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Years from now, people are gonna say, ""Remember that woman that came up with the harvest festival idea? """
Leslie Knope,And never came up with another idea again? What happened to her?
Leslie Knope,"What was her name? Kim? Anyway, who cares, she's stupid and she's dead."
Leslie Knope,"For the first time ever, the Parks department has real momentum and I'm gonna ruin it for everybody."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well okay, I would love to chit-chat about this, but I need to keep working and keep pushing, so my breakthrough will happen and I will be ready for it."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's happening?"
Leslie Knope,Ron. Ron what are you doing?
Leslie Knope,No Ron.
Leslie Knope,All my binders are downstairs.
Leslie Knope,"Fair enough, I'm just gonna go to bed, call it a night."
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh my God, there's like fifty cats in here."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"So I just slept 7 hours, which is twice as long as I usually sleep, so I'm little disoriented."
Leslie Knope,"But I did wake up with a million ideas, and Ron would not let me have any paper, so I had to write them down on this doily."
Leslie Knope,We should buy a telescope and make the old ranger station in Ramsett Park an observatory.
Leslie Knope,"That way, we could sell tickets and have class trips."
Leslie Knope,"Good. We'll have theme night at the park. Have singles, date night, seniors."
Leslie Knope,We could have a city-wide yard sale.
Leslie Knope,"Which could be part auction, part antique roadshow, then we could have professors come in and assign value to the objects."
Leslie Knope,"We could split the profits with the school, it'd be a lot of fun."
Leslie Knope,Bye Ron.
Leslie Knope,They say you're only as good as your last idea.
Leslie Knope,I say you're only as good as the people you work with.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope is back.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God my breath is so bad.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,They're young.
Leslie Knope,They're in love.
Leslie Knope,They're ready to show it to the world.
Leslie Knope,It's very sweet.
Leslie Knope,And we're all going.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You going tonight?
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will see you there, with all of those things."
Leslie Knope,I was actually coming to see you.
Leslie Knope,I wanted your advice on something.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,Do you wanna do that?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is a great city."
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world."
Leslie Knope,"But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government."
Leslie Knope,It's a tough call.
Leslie Knope,You know what I would do?
Leslie Knope,You should make a pros and cons list.
Leslie Knope,That always works for me.
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,Nice talking to you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody listen up."
Leslie Knope,April's friend Orin is here.
Leslie Knope,He's very intense and very weird.
Leslie Knope,"So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What'd you bring?
Leslie Knope,"No, a cake, but this is so much healthier."
Leslie Knope,"Take a walk, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this party needs a little help."
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
Leslie Knope,Is April pregnant?
Leslie Knope,Are you pregnant?
Leslie Knope,Are you sick?
Leslie Knope,Are you terminal?
Leslie Knope,Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,Why is this great thing happening?
Leslie Knope,That is a great story.
Leslie Knope,"But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live."
Leslie Knope,You can't just get a condo.
Leslie Knope,I love Andy and April as a couple.
Leslie Knope,I want them to stay together forever.
Leslie Knope,But relationships need planning.
Leslie Knope,You just can't jump into something without thinking.
Leslie Knope,"It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time!"
Leslie Knope,Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do."
Leslie Knope,"I know it doesn't work, from all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before."
Leslie Knope,But you know what would be fun?
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Leslie Knope,"Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together."
Leslie Knope,It'll be a blast.
Leslie Knope,You relax.
Leslie Knope,You relax all the way home and get into bed.
Leslie Knope,You need to go to bed.
Leslie Knope,You don't know each other's middle names?
Leslie Knope,You don't have to.
Leslie Knope,"One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours."
Leslie Knope,And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
Leslie Knope,And he was married.
Leslie Knope,But the clothes thing really bothered me.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann, it's Leslie, Leslie Knope from the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,April and Andy are getting married tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,"I need you to get down here, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"Help me, please!"
Leslie Knope,Relationships are like scuba diving.
Leslie Knope,"If you come up too fast, you get the bends."
Leslie Knope,"And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Leslie Knope,April and Andy are about to get married.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,It depends on how frequently you use it.
Leslie Knope,"Stay focused, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"The point is two boneheads, whom I love dearly, are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through."
Leslie Knope,And nobody seems concerned about this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is really happening.
Leslie Knope,I love April and Andy.
Leslie Knope,I want them to stay together.
Leslie Knope,And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Leslie Knope,I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
Leslie Knope,They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Weren't you married three times?
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna say another word.
Leslie Knope,This is your day.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You should stay.
Leslie Knope,Don't go back to Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,You should stay here.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"It's a great city here, you know? And there are great people."
Leslie Knope,And you've made a lot of friends.
Leslie Knope,And what are you gonna do? You gonna go back to your old job and hack up people's budgets? Stay here.
Leslie Knope,Help us build something.
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,So just keep your eyes on me.
Leslie Knope,"Don't panic, 'cause he can smell fear."
Leslie Knope,What do I Just keep talking to me.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,How are you? Good.
Leslie Knope,Run!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you guys, we got a video from April and Andy."
Leslie Knope,I don't believe it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's real.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Boys!
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I work for the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,Cool it!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting!
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Smells so bad!
Leslie Knope,Why would you think this was fun?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey!"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,You like it?
Leslie Knope,Boom!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go."
Leslie Knope,Who wants it?
Leslie Knope,"Whoo, missed it!"
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Actually, this is a little fun."
Leslie Knope,This is fun.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Ooh.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,"You know as well as I do that we are not allowed to accept gifts over 25 dollars, for corruption reasons."
Leslie Knope,We live in a fish bowl and the public is always watching.
Leslie Knope,That's why I go two towns over if I want to rent a movie with nudity in it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said that."
Leslie Knope,"But you cannot enjoy this basket, I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"And so to avoid temptation, I am gonna lock it up."
Leslie Knope,"So, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I asked April to create one of those social network Internet profiles for the Sullivan Street pit.
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready for the debut?"
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,I love a good ribbon cutting.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"April, that's good."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Kids.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,Mark's a friend.
Leslie Knope,Maybe those are his relatives.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we're good."
Leslie Knope,We'll keep checking in on this.
Leslie Knope,Attending yet another meeting of the old boys' club.
Leslie Knope,"Politics is full of boys' clubs, formal and informal."
Leslie Knope,Behind me are all the members of the city council over the past 30 years.
Leslie Knope,"And every day, as a woman, I have to walk past this wall of men."
Leslie Knope,It can be very upsetting.
Leslie Knope,Especially because of that guy.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at my chest."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,Wheeling and dealing.
Leslie Knope,Divvying up the empire.
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?
Leslie Knope,Let's go out there.
Leslie Knope,Let's bust up that old boys' club.
Leslie Knope,We're doing great work in the government.
Leslie Knope,We deserve to be included.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"That's good, think like a man."
Leslie Knope,"April, we're leaving, you're in charge."
Leslie Knope,And it's because you're a woman!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's up.
Leslie Knope,A couple of ladies are coming to bust up your little boys' club.
Leslie Knope,We're in.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Brian, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Deputy director of--
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, what are you guys talking about?"
Leslie Knope,What's the topic du jour?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Did you hear that?
Leslie Knope,That was the sound of a glass ceiling being shattered.
Leslie Knope,"The boys' club is more about socializing than work, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you gotta loosen up."
Leslie Knope,I kind of feel like I'm already in the boys' club.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at those bitches clean up after me."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like this."
Leslie Knope,This is banter.
Leslie Knope,Banter's fun.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Mixing it up with the boys!
Leslie Knope,So What are you gonna say?
Leslie Knope,What's your comeback?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boo."
Leslie Knope,"Brendanawicz, that's some weak sauce."
Leslie Knope,You need to hit harder!
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, you guys!"
Leslie Knope,Let's keep this good feeling going.
Leslie Knope,It's just getting started!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait."
Leslie Knope,Just hold on a second.
Leslie Knope,I got wine!
Leslie Knope,And cheese!
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"Last night, in a foolish attempt to infiltrate a boys' club, I violated the government employee ethics code of the state of Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"I have always tried to live my life in an ethical way, and last night, I failed."
Leslie Knope,"I realize I have let down every female public official in America, and I would like to apologize to them, right now, individually, and in alphabetical order."
Leslie Knope,"Michele Bachmann, Republican, Minnesota."
Leslie Knope,I am sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy Baldwin, Democrat, Wisconsin."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Melissa Bean.
Leslie Knope,There it is.
Leslie Knope,Let's clear the air.
Leslie Knope,"Last night, I opened up this gift basket, for my own pleasure."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not happy about it either, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I did."
Leslie Knope,And I would do it again.
Leslie Knope,Two wrongs do not make a right.
Leslie Knope,I did not know that at the time.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,It's evidence.
Leslie Knope,I appreciate and thank you in advance for your unwavering support.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have a very important and very long story to tell you."
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,"It happened right out there, right outside this window."
Leslie Knope,Why can't I look away?
Leslie Knope,I will blow this in proportion!
Leslie Knope,The minimum punishment for this is an official reprimand from the city manager.
Leslie Knope,Maybe in your world it isn't a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"You're a white Protestant man with a full, rich mustache."
Leslie Knope,But I am a woman and I need to hold myself up to a higher standard.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What do you suggest we do?
Leslie Knope,You think we should cover this up?
Leslie Knope,"Good, because the coverup is worse than the crime."
Leslie Knope,"When you spill something and you try to wipe it up with something that's dirty, then you get double dirty."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,"Since we last spoke, I have taken extraordinary steps to make further amends for the mistakes that I have made."
Leslie Knope,"I have written a full confession, which I will be emailing to everyone in the entire Pawnee government."
Leslie Knope,"I've also attached a link to the pit's web page, just to remind people of all the good work that I do."
Leslie Knope,"I asked Ron to blow the whistle on me, and he refused."
Leslie Knope,And that is why I had to whistle blow myself.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What am I looking at?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why did you do this?
Leslie Knope,And you put it in the pit's web page?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take this off."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I just sent an email to everyone in the government, and I put a link to this page!"
Leslie Knope,And I heard you loud and clear.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,This bench is so uncomfortable.
Leslie Knope,Ow.
Leslie Knope,Help.
Leslie Knope,"Please, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, tell me it's gonna be okay."
Leslie Knope,Tell me it's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Where are you?
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,"I've spoken to you a couple of times about something that happened, but I don't want to-- I don't want to talk about it anymore."
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that'd be great."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Zero.
Leslie Knope,Zero to six.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,Never.
Leslie Knope,Are they gonna ask that?
Leslie Knope,Zero to six.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, okay."
Leslie Knope,Timeout.
Leslie Knope,Timeout.
Leslie Knope,I need something to drink.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I meant water.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for being here with me today."
Leslie Knope,Nonetheless.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna take a glass of water first, if I may."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"""Two days ago, I attended an informal boys' club meeting for the very first time."""
Leslie Knope,"""After one and a half beers, awash in the glow of acceptance into this elite, exclusive club"""
Leslie Knope,"""A decision that will live in infamy."""
Leslie Knope,"""I opened a gift basket of wine and cheese."""
Leslie Knope,"""Our intern, April Ludgate, drank some of that wine without my knowledge."""
Leslie Knope,"""That was never part of the plan."""
Leslie Knope,"""She had not been invited to the meeting of the boys' club."""
Leslie Knope,"""I repeat, not been invited."""
Leslie Knope,"""Though it is my hope that someday, she lives in a world where the very idea of boys' clubs is ancient history."""
Leslie Knope,Please don't blame her for my mistake.
Leslie Knope,The biggest crime we could commit here would be to destroy a teenage girl's passion for local government.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course."
Leslie Knope,I awoke at 6:21 a.m. after a fitful night of sleep.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,Are we done?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I just wanted to say thank you, so--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're here.
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to be overdramatic, but today felt like 100 years in hell and the absolute worst day of my life."
Leslie Knope,I never should have opened that stupid basket.
Leslie Knope,I think it's 'cause I wanted to shatter the glass ceiling.
Leslie Knope,You know what I mean? And just kind of infiltrate the boys' club.
Leslie Knope,I did it for a guy.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,We had a brief affair in February of 2004.
Leslie Knope,"And there's still something very complicated between us, soâ¦"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You're not supposed to be drinking on government property.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, I have a letter in my file."
Leslie Knope,"Look out, boys."
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club now.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope,I'm in your Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Creepy.
Leslie Knope,We could have a City Hall dodgeball league!
Leslie Knope,"I have first pick, and my pick is Ron."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Joe."
Leslie Knope,Where is this coming from?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm not allowed there anymore."
Leslie Knope,"So, I have some ideas for the health initiative."
Leslie Knope,Or we could go out after work.
Leslie Knope,"You know, go to J.J's or something, grab a bite?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's do it."
Leslie Knope,"So, I asked Ben out to dinner and he said no."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"He was like, ""Huh? What? Uh... Bye."""
Leslie Knope,"And then, he walked into an office that wasn't his."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Who was that guy you were talking to out there?
Leslie Knope,And then also kissing?
Leslie Knope,I was-- Crap on a crayfish.
Leslie Knope,That really stings.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,I was just picturing it.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I don't think that's for me.
Leslie Knope,You're a monster.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, let's do it."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I'm glad that's over.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's not."
Leslie Knope,"[bleep] you, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,Is that a different guy from earlier?
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Yellow haired female.
Leslie Knope,Likes waffles and news.
Leslie Knope,Much better.
Leslie Knope,Organizing my agenda.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, that doesn't sound fun."
Leslie Knope,Jamming on my planner.
Leslie Knope,"Upstairs, there is this mural of wildflowers."
Leslie Knope,And I like to sit on a bench in front of it.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Just the bench in front of the mural.
Leslie Knope,"Eww, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I'm scared of bees.
Leslie Knope,Mural.
Leslie Knope,Love.
Leslie Knope,Love.
Leslie Knope,Love.
Leslie Knope,No opinion.
Leslie Knope,They're condescending.
Leslie Knope,He's dark and mysterious.
Leslie Knope,And he can sing.
Leslie Knope,And he plays the organ.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Entire universe of guys I might date, let's see what you got."
Leslie Knope,"Craig, your service is crap."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Your soul mate match was totally wrong for me.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I like him as a friend and everything, but I'd never go out with him."
Leslie Knope,He's like a little sister to me.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's not gonna last."
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Leslie Knope,Your marriage is a sham.
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, Craig."
Leslie Knope,He seems nice.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with me?
Leslie Knope,Why do good guys hate me and gross guys love me?
Leslie Knope,Diagnose me.
Leslie Knope,You're a nurse.
Leslie Knope,"So, I should go and ask them what they think I'm selling."
Leslie Knope,A douche-vestigation.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're gonna take this the wrong way, but can I talk to you for a second?"
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"No, here's fine."
Leslie Knope,I was flattered by what you said earlier.
Leslie Knope,"And I was just wondering, what do you look for in a woman?"
Leslie Knope,"So, basically, you're just attracted to me because I'm not an elderly person."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Do you wanna go to lunch?
Leslie Knope,We can go anywhere.
Leslie Knope,Your choice.
Leslie Knope,I'm buying.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You can get as many 'zerts as you want.
Leslie Knope,This'll be fun.
Leslie Knope,Let's say you rub a bottle and a genie comes out and gives you three wishes.
Leslie Knope,What would those wishes be?
Leslie Knope,This'll be a fun game.
Leslie Knope,Three wishes.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wish number two.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We don't have to do this anymore.
Leslie Knope,Let's play a different game.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna say stuff about me, and you say, on a scale from 1 to 10, how interested in that thing you are."
Leslie Knope,Ready?
Leslie Knope,I love sunshine and fresh air and early morning walks.
Leslie Knope,I've read five biographies of Eleanor Roosevelt.
Leslie Knope,I work at the Parks and Recreation--
Leslie Knope,That's what you do.
Leslie Knope,I once kissed a girl in college.
Leslie Knope,Where I graduated summa cum laude in history.
Leslie Knope,"So, the only thing that's important to you is hotness?"
Leslie Knope,Wendy?
Leslie Knope,Lucy?
Leslie Knope,All you cared about was the shape of their boobs?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Promise not to tell anyone?
Leslie Knope,"This is insane, but you and I got matched up on hoosiermate.com."
Leslie Knope,98% match.
Leslie Knope,Soulmate level match.
Leslie Knope,"This is not a date, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to figure out why only sleazy guys are into me right now.
Leslie Knope,"All right, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Enough.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Tom, I'm just printing out these health tips."
Leslie Knope,Can you grab them for me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,Office yoga.
Leslie Knope,We do stretches at our desk or next to our desk or in a chair.
Leslie Knope,Always good for you.
Leslie Knope,We give everyone pedometers and we have a contest.
Leslie Knope,Whoever takes the most steps wins a prize.
Leslie Knope,Anything to get their heart rate up.
Leslie Knope,Can you excuse us for a second?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you for a second?
Leslie Knope,Hey What is wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,You are being a little bit too much of an ass right now.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Knock it off.
Leslie Knope,You should be so lucky.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,They should fix that.
Leslie Knope,It was all just a joke.
Leslie Knope,"I can assure you, there's nothing romantic going on between me and Tom."
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's so cute."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we weren't-- No."
Leslie Knope,No hard feelings.
Leslie Knope,Really? Did he say who?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,No clue.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I never got to tell you the rest of my ideas."
Leslie Knope,You wanna go somewhere and talk about them?
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Sounds good.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if the online thing is for me.
Leslie Knope,I prefer to meet people in person.
Leslie Knope,It's like door number two on Let's Make a Deal.
Leslie Knope,"Do you want the thing that you have, that you know you like, but isn't perfect, or do you give it up for what's behind door number two? I think I like what I have."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna try to make it work with Tom.
Leslie Knope,"I'm kidding! All right, be honest, Tom."
Leslie Knope,How did you and I get matched up?
Leslie Knope,"N, Tom N. Haverford."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, whatever."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,That's enough.
Leslie Knope,"Donna? Every time I want you to shut up, from now on."
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Did I scare you?
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to remind you of the art show that's happening tonight at the community center.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Leslie Knope,I thought you had a rule about intergovernment relationships.
Leslie Knope,We weren't You You
Leslie Knope,"God, this sucks."
Leslie Knope,"I can't go home, because I have this art show opening at the community center, and I can't stay here because I see Ben, and I can't date Ben because of Chris' stupid rules."
Leslie Knope,I feel so
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm like that light bulb.
Leslie Knope,"Weak, flickering, barely giving off any light, unable to make out with the light bulb I want to make out with."
Leslie Knope,A hug?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, can you make the opening remarks?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just I'm not in the mood.
Leslie Knope,I don't have it in me right now.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,Do it for me.
Leslie Knope,Make the speech.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Give the speech, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Please give the speech.
Leslie Knope,Please give the speech.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,"Please, please."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, yes"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's me.
Leslie Knope,Is that me?
Leslie Knope,You're just realizing that now?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Leave it up.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to explain it.
Leslie Knope,"Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, ""What can't that centaur woman do?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Besides ride an escalator and drive a car."""
Leslie Knope,Art can be so magnificent.
Leslie Knope,"No, this painting isn't going anywhere, Tom."
Leslie Knope,It's staying right here.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow lover of the arts."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the painting.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"When you're done with the light, fix the printer."
Leslie Knope,Learn it.
Leslie Knope,"This isn't about you, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that's fair.
Leslie Knope,Bestiality?
Leslie Knope,"It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse."
Leslie Knope,Destroy it?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, is she serious?"
Leslie Knope,Do you find this personally offensive?
Leslie Knope,That painting is not going to be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,Every great work of art contains a message.
Leslie Knope,"And the message of this painting is, ""Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia."""
Leslie Knope,"Perd, it is a beautiful work of art."
Leslie Knope,"Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one."
Leslie Knope,I am not the subject.
Leslie Knope,The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.
Leslie Knope,But it does look a little bit like me.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It was never our intention to offend anyone I guess some people object to powerful depictions of awesome ladies.
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,Pornography is very difficult to define.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, ""I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did not know that Brandi was going to offer me a role in her next film."
Leslie Knope,I am not going to take the role.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.
Leslie Knope,"Stand down, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,This isn't your fight.
Leslie Knope,Fine with me.
Leslie Knope,Public Arts Commission.
Leslie Knope,Filled with hippies who love art and sometimes weed.
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,"Members of the Public Art Commission, good afternoon and good art."
Leslie Knope,Every great society has always supported artistic expression.
Leslie Knope,The Romans.
Leslie Knope,The Greeks.
Leslie Knope,Two great societies in Europe.
Leslie Knope,"There are some members of this community that would like to demonize this painting, and when they do they in fact demonize art itself."
Leslie Knope,What is or isn't art is up to every free thinking American to decide on their own.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's in the bag."
Leslie Knope,We've decided that the painting should be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,What are you serious?
Leslie Knope,You're supposed to be in favor of public art.
Leslie Knope,"You've made your point, okay"
Leslie Knope,Look this painting is very important to me
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't need to hang in a government building, just let me take it home and I'll keep it there."
Leslie Knope,What do you say?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Make me stag, I am Diaphena."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi."
Leslie Knope,"I was at a meeting around the corner and some people wanted to destroy this painting, so I brought it here."
Leslie Knope,Where is Andy and April?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,"Really, huh"
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?
Leslie Knope,Well it's a painting of me as a centaur.
Leslie Knope,And it's a nude.
Leslie Knope,"Just basically like the chestal region, mostly."
Leslie Knope,You don't have to look at it if you don't want to.
Leslie Knope,It's very classy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh man it's chris, I'm gonna take this."
Leslie Knope,Hi Chris.
Leslie Knope,What painting?
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, if I could just explain to you my point of view."
Leslie Knope,You're a level-headed person.
Leslie Knope,What do I do here?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
Leslie Knope,I'm so annoyed by all these rules lately.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I stole a painting, and I was hoping you guys would help me hide it."
Leslie Knope,No it's on the other side.
Leslie Knope,Does that look like me I don't even
Leslie Knope,You guys are sweet.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I should go, hit the road with this and..."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you later.
Leslie Knope,"Say goodbye to Diaphena, I have to turn her over to stupid Marcia Langman."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Come with me.
Leslie Knope,Let's take a look at it first shall we?
Leslie Knope,I had the artist paint over the original.
Leslie Knope,Feel free to destroy it.
Leslie Knope,But I think you'll find no one could possibly be offended.
Leslie Knope,Unless of course they have a problem with centaurs having modern haircuts.
Leslie Knope,"There were many kinds of Greek goddesses, some were lovers, some were warriors, and some were tricksters."
Leslie Knope,"He said he didn't like her, so it's over."
Leslie Knope,A real goddess.
Leslie Knope,"Gayle, I know Jerry is your husband."
Leslie Knope,Look I can promise you there's absolutely nothing going on between us.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I did not pose for that painting, but thank you for thinking I did."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, sure, hold on"
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Nice bench.
Leslie Knope,Is that new?
Leslie Knope,"No, that's been there since the '90s."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing for your birthday on Friday?
Leslie Knope,"Birthday, birthday, birthday It's your birthday It's your birthday, and I know when it is."
Leslie Knope,Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is.
Leslie Knope,He's even had it redacted on all government documents.
Leslie Knope,"Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a well placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you blew it."
Leslie Knope,All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.
Leslie Knope,"Was it worth it, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,Was it?
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna do nothing.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do something.
Leslie Knope,And it's gonna be really big.
Leslie Knope,I have a lot of years to make up for.
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and--"
Leslie Knope,"Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."
Leslie Knope,Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.
Leslie Knope,We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"Then she went to work in Eagleton and ""fixed her deviated septum"" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else."
Leslie Knope,What was it again?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Her soul.
Leslie Knope,"To be fair, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.
Leslie Knope,But it has a lot of heart.
Leslie Knope,"We should stand up for our town, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I am on ""Operation No More Fence,"" so I'm putting you in charge of ""Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe."""
Leslie Knope,I just need you to do what's on that list.
Leslie Knope,That's arson.
Leslie Knope,This woman's right.
Leslie Knope,"I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Lindsay!
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,It has.
Leslie Knope,You look amazing.
Leslie Knope,This is Ann.
Leslie Knope,She is my best friend.
Leslie Knope,Now.
Leslie Knope,"And she's a nurse, and she works at a hospital."
Leslie Knope,It's really nice outside.
Leslie Knope,Shall we speak in my courtyard?
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you so much for stopping by."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I found a picture of you from back in the day."
Leslie Knope,So let's talk about Lafayette Park.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you."
Leslie Knope,"When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone."
Leslie Knope,That's what makes them so great.
Leslie Knope,Wowsers.
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas."
Leslie Knope,And that someone was this woman.
Leslie Knope,You can take it if you want.
Leslie Knope,I have many copies and the negatives.
Leslie Knope,And I have a JPEG.
Leslie Knope,"Lindsay, if we"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm not asleep.
Leslie Knope,I'm awake.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wide awake, and I got my eyes on you."
Leslie Knope,That's what I would've said if I had thought of it in the moment.
Leslie Knope,What did I say instead?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's not that great."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Eagleton is nicer than Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"And, yes, because of their cupcake factory, the air always smells like vanilla."
Leslie Knope,But their people are not inherently better than our people.
Leslie Knope,"The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income."
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,Factoid alert.
Leslie Knope,Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee was established in May of 1817.
Leslie Knope,"And by July, finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable, all the wealthy people evacuated to Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Well, nice outfit."
Leslie Knope,"What, did you just come from the stables?"
Leslie Knope,I would not.
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to get off your high horse, Lindsay."
Leslie Knope,Pun intended.
Leslie Knope,"You know if I had your job, there would be no fence there."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,that the EagletonPawnee fence does a lot more harm than it does good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would like to respectfully say that any child should be able to play in any park, regardless of wealth or status."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, this is Joey Plunkett."
Leslie Knope,"Joey, wave to the audience."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you can't, because you broke your arm climbing that fence."
Leslie Knope,"No, you can't."
Leslie Knope,Both your arms are broken.
Leslie Knope,"Well, with more due respect, a lot of boys do that in our town."
Leslie Knope,You cannot be sure that he is the one.
Leslie Knope,I'm not done.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, let's go."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, not you too."
Leslie Knope,"Man, she used to not be like this."
Leslie Knope,Eagleton really changed her.
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, Eagleton offered me that job."
Leslie Knope,"I talked it over with Lindsay, and we made a pact that we would stay in Pawnee together and work hard and fight to make Pawnee a better place to live."
Leslie Knope,"And then they offered her the job, and she took it and disappeared."
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody just grab a bag and open it up and then try to find some dirty stuff in there."
Leslie Knope,Eagleton treats us like garbage.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna treat them like garbage.
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna take these bags of trash, and we're gonna throw it over to their side of the park."
Leslie Knope,And then we're just gonna let the stink and the raccoons run wild.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What am I thinking? Let's just stop this.
Leslie Knope,Put everything back in the truck.
Leslie Knope,Let's back it up.
Leslie Knope,"I am so sick of this, Lindsay."
Leslie Knope,"You might have a fancy car and a mahogany purse, or whatever rich people have, but I remember something that you're trying to forget."
Leslie Knope,You're a Pawnee girl.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then why do you come here at dinnertime and get takeout from the legendary J.J's Diner?"
Leslie Knope,Don't you dare feed that waffle to that dog to get it to poop.
Leslie Knope,How dare you? No!
Leslie Knope,I want her arrested for attempted murder.
Leslie Knope,I will never apologize to her.
Leslie Knope,Nor I her.
Leslie Knope,I doth proclaim to be a stupid fart face.
Leslie Knope,Did G.B. Shaw write your stupid fart face?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming to get me.
Leslie Knope,"It was a rough night, but I survived."
Leslie Knope,Scone? They only have maple walnut.
Leslie Knope,The only thing I'm guilty of is loving Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"And punching Lindsay in the face, and shoving a coffee filter down her pants."
Leslie Knope,"But in my defense, I believe that assault should be illegal if the person is a jerk."
Leslie Knope,Because she's a stupid jerk.
Leslie Knope,because we were best friends and then she sold out everything that we believed in.
Leslie Knope,"and the worst part, to her our friendship it's like it never happened."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Wait a minute, oh my god, okay we have a lot of work to do."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, put these scones in your bra, let's go."
Leslie Knope,"Hey Lindsay, introducing the Pawnee wiffle ball league."
Leslie Knope,It's an idea that I came up with after my best friend Ann over there said she wanted to bash your head in with a baseball bat.
Leslie Knope,"and I want to thank you for the fence, there's no way we could afford that high quality wood."
Leslie Knope,One of the many Eagleton kids who signed up will just pop over and grab it.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing tonight?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, I thought maybe you could bust out your old Jazz sweatshirt and you and I could go to Sullivan's for a beer."
Leslie Knope,I know you do.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I work with some really great people."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, did you hear the news?"
Leslie Knope,Ben and chris want us to go into conference room C for a meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Happy birthday, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I did that for Ann.
Leslie Knope,why would I throw Ron Swanson an Ann Perkins party?
Leslie Knope,That was just a list of ways to mess with you.
Leslie Knope,She do them all?
Leslie Knope,"So, I have rented Bridge on the River Kwai and the Dirty Dozen."
Leslie Knope,Artie from security is outside the door so no one will bother you.
Leslie Knope,and a cab will be here whenever you're ready to take you home.
Leslie Knope,Do you remember what you said to me five years ago when Eagleton offered me that job and I asked you for advice?
Leslie Knope,"Right, but after, when I pressed you?"
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's how I remember it."
Leslie Knope,"This, by the way, is a onetime only situation."
Leslie Knope,"Next year, your birthday party is going to be a rager."
Leslie Knope,"I did, I broke"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, let's not fight, I broke it, let me pay for it Ron."
Leslie Knope,What does Kahlua style mean?
Leslie Knope,"I'm so glad we found this time to talk ,it feels like it's been forever."
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's start with the personal stuff."
Leslie Knope,How's Jessie?
Leslie Knope,The photographer guy.
Leslie Knope,Uhuh.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I liked him.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I could get that book back that I loaned him?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,Race you.
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, got to go."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, move!"
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Howser, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Nice to see you as always.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Ann should do it.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I know."
Leslie Knope,I couldn't get it earlier.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,You can thank me later.
Leslie Knope,"But first, you need to go over your homework."
Leslie Knope,These are all the health initiatives the city has ever undertaken since the 1960s.
Leslie Knope,So you need to partially memorize that.
Leslie Knope,"And it's gonna be a long night, so I got you some energy drinks and some chocolate covered espresso beans and the book Freedom by Jonathan Franzen."
Leslie Knope,"Because I'm almost done with it, Ann."
Leslie Knope,And I want to talk to you about Patty.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,"I just think with this new job, you could make a difference."
Leslie Knope,Make real change happen.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we'd be working in the same building."
Leslie Knope,No more lightning round catchup sessions.
Leslie Knope,This is your destiny Ann.
Leslie Knope,You don't want to waste away at Pawnee St. Joseph's medical center and turn into her.
Leslie Knope,"And let's be honest, it would be nice to not have to pull strange things out of people's butts every night."
Leslie Knope,It happened once.
Leslie Knope,That already is too many times.
Leslie Knope,Snake Juice!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Here?
Leslie Knope,"High end, VIP, exclusive."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how's it going?"
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be fine.
Leslie Knope,People will definitely buy it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, JeanRalphio."
Leslie Knope,So you're helping Tom.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I know tonight's gonna be a big success, and I wish I could stay."
Leslie Knope,"I really do, but I have to go help Ann."
Leslie Knope,She's gonna be up all night cramming for a big job interview.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,And I'm seeing you here.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'm surprised."
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe you'd be home preparing for tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,But you are going in for the interview tomorrow?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I had met you before."
Leslie Knope,I actually was on your show once--
Leslie Knope,So how did you two meet?
Leslie Knope,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's okay."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I should've known better than to loan something to one of your boyfriends."
Leslie Knope,They come and go so fast.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, let's be honest."
Leslie Knope,How long is it gonna last with this guy?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this hat is an idiot."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm not-- Are you-- You seem mad at me.
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad at you.
Leslie Knope,Neither am I.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"No offense, but I'm going slow because I might lose my job."
Leslie Knope,"No offense, but I don't remember you having a nursing degree in feelings."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm very angry, and I'm really drunk."
Leslie Knope,Do you want to dance with me?
Leslie Knope,"Go get me another ""Snork Juice."""
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,Jean-Ralphio!
Leslie Knope,Dance up on me.
Leslie Knope,"If you're worried about working with Chris, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"He's fine with it, he said it wouldn't be weird."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"This is my first fight with Ann, and it's a doozy."
Leslie Knope,But I believe that honest discussions between friends can lead to deeper intimacy.
Leslie Knope,"This is a watershed moment in our relationship, and it's important that we fight clean."
Leslie Knope,All I need to do is focus and stay calm.
Leslie Knope,"You're stupid, and you're drunk and you're stupid."
Leslie Knope,It's not Everything isn't your fault all the time.
Leslie Knope,Don't always make everything your fault.
Leslie Knope,I didn't mean it like that.
Leslie Knope,You know I didn't mean it like that.
Leslie Knope,"I just meant you were being stupid, and you were acting like a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm sorry that I thought about you for the job, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes if I don't push you in the right direction, you end up standing still."
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to do you a favor.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we shouldn't work together, then."
Leslie Knope,You don't even know one thing.
Leslie Knope,I didn't even say one thing.
Leslie Knope,"And then she asked me the whole thing, and I didn't even do it once."
Leslie Knope,Your mother's butt.
Leslie Knope,I'm here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm so hung over.
Leslie Knope,I've never been this hung over.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am out of questions."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe that fight I had with Ann.
Leslie Knope,"I owe her, like, a million apologies."
Leslie Knope,"I think I owe you one, too."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm sad."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,But we can't give you your job back.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"All right, who's next? You came."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this committee would like to ask if you are the kind of candidate who could forgive someone after they've behaved like a complete jackass?"
Leslie Knope,"Please, don't worry about it."
Leslie Knope,The committee totally understands.
Leslie Knope,Would you mind if I joined you?
Leslie Knope,Shall we? Ann came in the next day and had a second interview with Chris.
Leslie Knope,"She nailed it, of course."
Leslie Knope,But she doesn't want to totally leave her job.
Leslie Knope,So they struck up a deal.
Leslie Knope,"She works at City Hall part-time, and two days a week, she still gets to be the greatest nurse in the world."
Leslie Knope,Win-win.
Leslie Knope,We need to remember what's important in life.
Leslie Knope,"Friends, waffles, and work."
Leslie Knope,"Or waffles, friends, work."
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,But work is third.
Leslie Knope,That's me!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You're so welcome.
Leslie Knope,I was thinking about you when I wrote it.
Leslie Knope,"Cause I was, um"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I guess we should head over there.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I'll see you there, Benjamin."
Leslie Knope,Ben.
Leslie Knope,It can't happen.
Leslie Knope,We could both get fired.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Good plan.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, everything you have is too sexy."
Leslie Knope,This is actually the dress that Julia Roberts wore as a prostitute in Pretty Woman.
Leslie Knope,"I need, like, a sweat suit or something."
Leslie Knope,I need to send out a signal that nothing is gonna happen.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I could literally get ""afired."""
Leslie Knope,"I need to think of unsexy, boring conversation topics we can talk about in the car."
Leslie Knope,I have a few ideas.
Leslie Knope,"We could discuss The New Yorker article ""The History of the Ladder."""
Leslie Knope,"We could talk about different dorms at Johns Hopkins University, and I could read from my Sonicare booklet."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so, basically every dorm allows bed lofting, but the students have really taken to it at Wolman and McCoy."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,Ann and I burned an awesome CD for the trip.
Leslie Knope,"It's an amazing instrument, the banjo."
Leslie Knope,Whale sounds.
Leslie Knope,You can change it if you want.
Leslie Knope,What the hell?
Leslie Knope,Did you see this?
Leslie Knope,"According to their rules, we may not have enough hotel rooms within city limits."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, maybe we could just point out to them there are tons of hotel rooms just outside city limits."
Leslie Knope,Have you been to the Granville Hotel and Spa?
Leslie Knope,They have the softest towels.
Leslie Knope,Me too.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Their bath mats are amazing.
Leslie Knope,It's like stepping on a lamb.
Leslie Knope,Get away from me.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm allergic to fingers.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should just not talk to each other for the rest of the trip, and I'm just gonna concentrate on the presentation."
Leslie Knope,"And, so, as you can see, Pawnee has 12 beautiful baseball diamonds, and our seats have extra cushioning due to the massive size of our average citizen."
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Leslie Knope,The raccoon problem is under control.
Leslie Knope,"They have their part of the town, and we have ours."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, cheers, sir!"
Leslie Knope,You did it.
Leslie Knope,"No, normally I do it."
Leslie Knope,"This time, you did it."
Leslie Knope,You should take the praise.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we were thinking about going to dinner, photographer."
Leslie Knope,You want in?
Leslie Knope,You wanna grab some grub?
Leslie Knope,They have great burgers.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure they have great burgers there, though."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, photographer."
Leslie Knope,Last chance.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then, it's just us then."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I tried.
Leslie Knope,You were really great in that presentation today.
Leslie Knope,I liked the stuff you said about Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,That was really nice to hear.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not just you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go see a man about some porcelain, you know what I mean?"
Leslie Knope,I'm not buying cocaine.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the bathroom.
Leslie Knope,"The whiz palace, as I like to call it."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm not calling Ann, so Ann, we have a serious code Ben."
Leslie Knope,"He told me that he liked me, and I'm gonna go make out with him right now."
Leslie Knope,On his face.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Read me the script.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Shut up, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"No, you-- Then, Leslie, Leslie, you don't know what you're talking about."
Leslie Knope,"I care about him very much, and I've had two and a half glasses of red wine, and what that means is I'm gonna go make out with him right now, and it's gonna be awesome."
Leslie Knope,"No, you're supposed to talk me out of this."
Leslie Knope,"Shut up, Ann, I'm doing it anyway."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we couldn't put you out like that."
Leslie Knope,We're on Chris' couch.
Leslie Knope,Well Well
Leslie Knope,"I think I might go to bed, too, actually."
Leslie Knope,"You, too."
Leslie Knope,"Good, I'm gonna go to bed."
Leslie Knope,Good night.
Leslie Knope,"Well, actually, I think it's good that Chris showed up, 'cause I wasn't thinking clearly."
Leslie Knope,"I love my job, Ben loves his job, and it's just not worth the risk."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,Chris just wanted me to drop off these receipts.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Uh-oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever in her new part-time job in the Public Health Department at City Hall, it's Ann Meredith Perkins!"
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,We have activities every hour on your first day.
Leslie Knope,"10 a.m., Ann's first day waffle explosion."
Leslie Knope,11 a.m. The start paperwork jamboree.
Leslie Knope,"And then 12:00 noon sharp is the inaugural ""D-Ann-ce Party."""
Leslie Knope,There's seven.
Leslie Knope,And you have an office mate.
Leslie Knope,"His name is Stuart, and he's kind of a grouch."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Just to let you know, I gave the senior center project to Donna."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Conference room ""C""."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call."
Leslie Knope,The best part of any relationship is the beginning.
Leslie Knope,"No problems, no fights."
Leslie Knope,"Just white wine, cuddling, and crazy amounts of History Channel documentaries."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"I just don't wanna talk about it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I'll see you tonight.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Just a coincidence.
Leslie Knope,We get it all the time.
Leslie Knope,We laugh about it.
Leslie Knope,But I've never met her.
Leslie Knope,She's Filipino.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,"Because Ben and I are in this amazing little bubble right now, and there's no room in here for Chris' stupid rules about us not dating or my ballbusting mother."
Leslie Knope,You know what I should do?
Leslie Knope,"I should get my mother a oneway ticket to London, leaving today."
Leslie Knope,"And that way, Ben never has to meet her and I could visit her in London."
Leslie Knope,Everybody wins.
Leslie Knope,"Stuart, please, could you give us, like, 45 minutes?"
Leslie Knope,Stuart.
Leslie Knope,That guy was rude.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Nothing much.
Leslie Knope,"Since I'm here, I just wanted to let you know that Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom."
Leslie Knope,"Also, she can be cruel and difficult, and she makes snap judgments about people that she holds on to for a very long time."
Leslie Knope,And she's kind of a bully.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Go in there, you're gonna be great."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Somebody made somebody a mix!
Leslie Knope,"And I definitely heard your feedback from last time, so I only put five Sarah McLachlan songs on this one."
Leslie Knope,Should we?
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to delay the inevitable.
Leslie Knope,"If this turns into something real, then we are gonna have to deal with Chris' rule, and parents, and annoying flossing habits, and a lot of unfun stuff."
Leslie Knope,But not yet.
Leslie Knope,I just want to enjoy the bubble for a little while.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Everything's good?
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go ask her how it went, and I bet she loved you."
Leslie Knope,No reason.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,It's totally fine.
Leslie Knope,No one's gonna believe that.
Leslie Knope,"When I first met you, I thought you were a fascist hardass."
Leslie Knope,"A cute fascist hardass, but still, you give off a very--"
Leslie Knope,I thought they only wanted four.
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to Belize and go scuba diving.
Leslie Knope,And we could look at the whale sharks.
Leslie Knope,"You're certified, right?"
Leslie Knope,Let's get you certified.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you need to be strong, powerful, decisive."
Leslie Knope,This is not a meeting.
Leslie Knope,It's a battle.
Leslie Knope,Normal meeting rules do not apply.
Leslie Knope,"I'll be my mom and I'm gonna be very harsh with you, and it's only because I like you a lot."
Leslie Knope,Go!
Leslie Knope,Wrong.
Leslie Knope,No preambles.
Leslie Knope,No introductions.
Leslie Knope,Just walk in and start talking.
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to discuss your rhyming, Dr. Seuss."
Leslie Knope,And you should be sitting by now.
Leslie Knope,Just walk in and take a seat.
Leslie Knope,"""Um"" is the sound in ""dumb."""
Leslie Knope,That's what she says to people.
Leslie Knope,And now you've crossed your legs like a woman.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, we need to put a pin in this."
Leslie Knope,"Here is a list of my mother's top starting with Persian rugs, ending with Daniel Craig."
Leslie Knope,You have 10 minutes to memorize it.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Mommy.
Leslie Knope,Of course!
Leslie Knope,"I just figured, hey, why not put my mother in a good mood?"
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, but I'm having coffee with my daughter."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we could do this another time.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, maybe you should talk to him, Mom."
Leslie Knope,He seems pretty self-assured.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on."
Leslie Knope,Let's relax.
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, this is some of my best work."
Leslie Knope,This could not have gone better.
Leslie Knope,They are really hitting it off.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,Crisis averted.
Leslie Knope,Yeah So you have a deal.
Leslie Knope,"What's so great is, she was impressed by you, too."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you could tell instantly."
Leslie Knope,The way you guys were connecting was really amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Now, what I'm thinking is that maybe we should go over to her house"
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, I'm a genius."
Leslie Knope,The only thing my mom loves more than music boxes is McSteamy from Grey's Anatomy.
Leslie Knope,"So, I made her a McSteamystyle music box, and I thought maybe you could give it to her."
Leslie Knope,She would love you for it.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's not the best picture of him, but--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I can't even have this conversation.
Leslie Knope,The whole thing is screwed up now.
Leslie Knope,"There's so many ways to destroy a bubble, but my mom flirting with you is number one on the list."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm sorry, I have to say this, were you asking for it in any way?"
Leslie Knope,How were you dressed?
Leslie Knope,Here's what we do.
Leslie Knope,"You issue a government-wide memo about sexual harassment, and then you go to Mexico."
Leslie Knope,Just for a couple of weeks.
Leslie Knope,Where are you going? Ben! Ben! Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Just-- Hey-- Hi, Mom."
Leslie Knope,"That's what we thought, too."
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,You keep your hands off him.
Leslie Knope,Kind of figured you'd be back in your office by now.
Leslie Knope,Seems like everyone else is back to normal.
Leslie Knope,How long do you have to do this?
Leslie Knope,Citizen request.
Leslie Knope,"Swivel, swivel, swivel."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"I can help you in here, sir."
Leslie Knope,"I have some very important news about our favorite minihorse, Li'I Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,He died last night.
Leslie Knope,"But we can take comfort in the fact that he is in heaven now, doing the two things he loves doing the most."
Leslie Knope,Eating carrots and urinating freely.
Leslie Knope,"Because of all he's done for the town, we are gonna be holding a small memorial service for him."
Leslie Knope,"But for now, I think we should bow our heads in a moment of silence."
Leslie Knope,"I got it, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"It's times like this, when someone or some horse passes, that you really take stock of your life."
Leslie Knope,You look around you and you start to realize what it is that you truly care about.
Leslie Knope,"For Li'l Sebastian, I imagine it was good fresh oats, a trough of water, and a willing sexual partner."
Leslie Knope,Or non-willing.
Leslie Knope,"He was a horse, so I think they had to do it either way."
Leslie Knope,"From now on, we stop mourning Li'l Sebastian's death and we start celebrating his life."
Leslie Knope,That's what he would've wanted.
Leslie Knope,So maintenance is gonna set up the stage.
Leslie Knope,Ron will be laying the ceremonial wreath.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jerry, that sounds wonderful."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, I need you to write a memorial song."
Leslie Knope,"Something like Candle in the Wind, but 5,000 times better."
Leslie Knope,"He sleeps on a futon, so"
Leslie Knope,We can give him 50 bucks.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here is a memo with some facts about Li'I Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,I think you'll find yours particularly interesting.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,Must be a typo.
Leslie Knope,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, we trust you."
Leslie Knope,Make us proud.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I'm meeting him in your office in a few minutes, how do I look?"
Leslie Knope,Sophisticated with a hint of slutty.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, I don't know, when I look at my life right now, it feels almost perfect."
Leslie Knope,"I mean we have to sleep around, but weirdly it's kind of fun that no one knows."
Leslie Knope,But enough about me.
Leslie Knope,How's Ann?
Leslie Knope,Don't even talk about Chris.
Leslie Knope,"Every time I hear his name, I think about the fact that he's gonna find out about me and Ben, and he's gonna fire both of us."
Leslie Knope,And about how much he hurt you.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting and wrong.
Leslie Knope,I don't even get Why would I I've never had sex with anyone anywhere.
Leslie Knope,"It's none of your You have the nerve, the audacity Ben is my boss, technically."
Leslie Knope,"And he is terrible, facewise."
Leslie Knope,"And how How do I know, frankly, that you're not sleeping with him?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe you are.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you're trying to throw me off.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Check and mate.
Leslie Knope,This is an outrage!
Leslie Knope,Who do I call?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,How did you find out?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,And this is how Eleanor Roosevelt would kiss.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, lay down."
Leslie Knope,Please tell me you hung up before Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, we're being very careful."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, President, Reagan, my blazer popped open."
Leslie Knope,Oh no.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you've proven your point."
Leslie Knope,"So the only people that know are my mom, Ann, and Ron."
Leslie Knope,And they're not gonna say anything.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah."
Leslie Knope,We can't.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,That feels appropriate.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, I think we can get away with that as long as we don't do stuff like this."
Leslie Knope,You can just leave it there.
Leslie Knope,"So my mom, Ron, Ann, and that guy."
Leslie Knope,Hey friend.
Leslie Knope,What you saw was not what you think it is.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, right."
Leslie Knope,I won the MacArthur Genius Grant.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,You should do that and you should get a massage.
Leslie Knope,"I have a gift certificate actually, my mom gave it to me for you."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,And thank you for your discretion.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Sebastian may have been li'I, but his impact on this town and the Parks Department was anything but li'I."
Leslie Knope,"I would like to introduce his owner's, Michael and Elizabeth Stone, and two of his closest friends."
Leslie Knope,"Not only was Coconut a friend, but she was also a lover."
Leslie Knope,Our deepest sympathy is with you.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,That guy left?
Leslie Knope,What a Okay.
Leslie Knope,Start the video presentation.
Leslie Knope,I'll deal with it.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need you to go get some propane."
Leslie Knope,"No one wants you to read a poem, okay, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"What everyone wants, what Li'I Sebastian wants, is for you to get propane."
Leslie Knope,We'd like to encourage everyone to buy our merchandise.
Leslie Knope,"All the proceeds will go towards Li'I Sebastian's favorite charity, the Afghan Institute of Learning."
Leslie Knope,"Next, we have a special musical tribute by Mr."
Leslie Knope,Andy Dwyer.
Leslie Knope,"Because Joe from sewage had to hand out the armbands, and Perd had to fill in for Mortenson, and Mortenson had to fill in for Howser."
Leslie Knope,Because Donna's reading Jerry's Italian poem.
Leslie Knope,This is sort of a mess.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay, we're--"
Leslie Knope,Because you are doing something better.
Leslie Knope,"You are lighting the memorial flame, which is the greatest honor of all."
Leslie Knope,"I saved it for you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"A very nosy maintenance worker, and we talked to him, and now we're all friends, and he's not gonna tell on us."
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry, you put propane in the eternal flame, right?"
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,We planned that!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, wow!"
Leslie Knope,We planned that.
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson loves his facial hair.
Leslie Knope,And we burned it off.
Leslie Knope,"This thing that we're doing, it's unsustainable."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I like you.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I like my job.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, operation shutdown."
Leslie Knope,No more secret handholding.
Leslie Knope,No more smooching in Ann's office.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, when we're at work, we just shouldn't talk to each other at all."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,But it's worth the risk if I can be with you.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,I'm glad.
Leslie Knope,'Cause it was planned.
Leslie Knope,"Well, a lot of people contributed to that."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Which office in particular?
Leslie Knope,"Absotootly, I am."
Leslie Knope,Very sorry that I just used that word.
Leslie Knope,But yes.
Leslie Knope,I just I've dreamed about this moment for a long time.
Leslie Knope,Would I have to quit my job?
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Absotootly I am.
Leslie Knope,Very sorry that I just used that word.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,They want me to run for office.
Leslie Knope,"I know, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yea.
Leslie Knope,Yea!
Leslie Knope,Yea!
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I think it's gonna be really bad.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, please."
Leslie Knope,Yea.
Leslie Knope,Just one second.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, hey!"
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I saw her in the courtyard."
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,So did you get a chance to look at my sample position papers?
Leslie Knope,How do you feel about my stance on Egyptian debt relief?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,My strategy is to win.
Leslie Knope,I've been dreaming about running for public office my whole life.
Leslie Knope,"While other girls were playing with Barbies, I was playing with a Geraldine Ferraro action figure that I made myself from a picture of her that I glued onto a popsicle stick."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm looking forward to it."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Uh Lady just ladies.
Leslie Knope,Meeting for the ladies' yacht club.
Leslie Knope,"Anchors away, ladies."
Leslie Knope,Just don't
Leslie Knope,"After I tell him, I'm running for office, we're gonna have to break up."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful, naive, sophisticated, newborn baby."
Leslie Knope,"Before, if people found out, we would maybe lose our jobs."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if people find out, it's gonna be a major scandal."
Leslie Knope,My campaign will be over before it begins.
Leslie Knope,I have a plan.
Leslie Knope,And it's really good.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna postpone telling him until you figure out what I'm supposed to do.
Leslie Knope,So get crackin'.
Leslie Knope,Fine!
Leslie Knope,I'll do it.
Leslie Knope,"God, who keeps emailing me?"
Leslie Knope,A penis.
Leslie Knope,Whoever this is sent it to every woman in the entire government.
Leslie Knope,"No, Andy, he did it on purpose."
Leslie Knope,Hioh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, Perd, it's not that big a deal."
Leslie Knope,If you know what I mean.
Leslie Knope,"When men in government behave this way, they betray the public's trust."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time for more women to be in charge.
Leslie Knope,How was that?
Leslie Knope,Was that okay?
Leslie Knope,Friday.
Leslie Knope,In three months.
Leslie Knope,"No, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we'll do that then now soon."
Leslie Knope,"And, um, I just have something I've been postponing for a while that I need to do, but I'll do it now."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Yea.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,I need to talk to you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's horrible."
Leslie Knope,Or good full disclosure.
Leslie Knope,I didn't listen to what you just said.
Leslie Knope,I need to talk to you about something
Leslie Knope,"Bad, really bad."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I started crying because he gave me an eclair."
Leslie Knope,And then we made out and spent the night together.
Leslie Knope,"But this morning in the cold light of day, I cooked breakfast and we made out some more."
Leslie Knope,"He gave me an eclair, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"Before I do this, is there any possible way that we could still keep dating?"
Leslie Knope,Which is out of the question.
Leslie Knope,Do you need to get that?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and I'm gonna be direct and honest with you."
Leslie Knope,I would like a glass of red wine and I'll take the cheapest one you have because I can't tell the difference.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here's the deal.
Leslie Knope,"I really, really like you."
Leslie Knope,I highly doubt that.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Is this jewelry?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I need to go to Another place."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom the Whiz Palace, as we like to call it here and I'm going to be back and I'm not gonna split."
Leslie Knope,I'm here for you because we need to talk about stuff.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Wait Ron.
Leslie Knope,Running away from my problems.
Leslie Knope,"Ok, so here's what's going on."
Leslie Knope,"Friday, I'm supposed to announce that I'm running for City Council, and I haven't told Ben yet."
Leslie Knope,"I know I said that we broke up, but we couldn't."
Leslie Knope,We're still dating.
Leslie Knope,"But now I have to break up with him for real, but I don't wanna break up with him because he's so cute."
Leslie Knope,He's so nice.
Leslie Knope,I didn't even ask you last night.
Leslie Knope,What is going on with Tammy one?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'd really love to shoot a gun right now.
Leslie Knope,I might not win.
Leslie Knope,I might not run.
Leslie Knope,"I figure we build a fire, roast the fish we shot, and make s'mores."
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I always carry emergency s'more rations in my car.
Leslie Knope,"Given your hunting abilities and my chocolate supply, I figure we could stay up here for two three years."
Leslie Knope,That's awful.
Leslie Knope,You only have nine toes?
Leslie Knope,Especially if you only have nine toes.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,That was uncalled for.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, City Council."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I think that's premature.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, there will be a 300 page orientation booklet as well as a dozen homemade cookies in the shape of your face."
Leslie Knope,But today There's something else I have to do.
Leslie Knope,"I know I've been acting really weird lately, and, um, I really like you."
Leslie Knope,"What I'm about to say is gonna contradict the idea that I really like you, but that won't change"
Leslie Knope,"Please stop bringing out the box, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"You're being really nice, and what I'm about to say is gonna make you hate me."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You knew?
Leslie Knope,Why? Why do we have to break up?
Leslie Knope,But I really like sleeping with my boss.
Leslie Knope,How did you figure it out?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but I covered that pretty well."
Leslie Knope,Did I have a good opening line?
Leslie Knope,"Friends, honored guests, Pawneeans."
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, and I am running for City Council."
Leslie Knope,"Ok guys, a Battle Royale is coming up."
Leslie Knope,"Every department, in one room, arguing for more money."
Leslie Knope,Budgetary Thunder Dome.
Leslie Knope,"So uhm, make a list of why other departments suck and I gonna get the secret weapon."
Leslie Knope,Our secret weapon in this budgetary battle Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Every time another department asks for more money, he just stares them down until they back off and/or wet themselves."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, who's ready to get what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Your worst nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is a federal tax audit."

Leslie Knope,"Jail, jail, jail."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, April!"

Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Rescue Ron"" is starting."
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,I will think of a better name for it by tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, most of these aren't even receipts."
Leslie Knope,"This one says, ""I bought supplies. 2007."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, looks like we have some actual receipts here."
Leslie Knope,"Same amount, every month."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Leslie Knope,How did you meet Tammy One?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."

Leslie Knope,I don't believe we've met.
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, deputy"

Leslie Knope,"Oh, II'm just wondering how long that's going to take, because Ron and I have a very important meeting together."
Leslie Knope,It's called the Battle Royale.
Leslie Knope,It's super fun.
Leslie Knope,I'll I'll head down to payroll.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, ma'am."

Leslie Knope,What is going on?
Leslie Knope,Where's Tammy One?

Leslie Knope,And how is that gonna help?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what is this memo you sent to me?"
Leslie Knope,You're not going to the battle royale?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, first of all, it's disturbing that you wrote a memo, at all."
Leslie Knope,But you love arguing against government spending.
Leslie Knope,Why do you not wanna do it now?
Leslie Knope,You and I are going to lunch.
Leslie Knope,We have to talk.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,You're going to lunch with me.

Leslie Knope,"When Ron falls for Tammy Two, he turns into a demonic sex maniac."

Leslie Knope,Neutered wimp?
Leslie Knope,This is worse.
Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Golden Dove"" is in trouble."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, there are some things I want to speak to you about but I'm not quite sure how to phrase them."
Leslie Knope,I was hoping to speak with Ron alone.
Leslie Knope,"Huh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Then I'll say it to her.
Leslie Knope,"You're evil, and you need to go."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,Let's cut the crap.
Leslie Knope,Is this audit even real?
Leslie Knope,You gold digger.
Leslie Knope,You're literally a gold digger.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, we're being attacked by Godzilla."
Leslie Knope,"And to beat Godzilla, we need Mothra."
Leslie Knope,No offense.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, we need you to break Ron from her spell."
Leslie Knope,"Can't you just move your butt around, or wear a dress made out of meat?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,Is this Ron?
Leslie Knope,Why do you have so many guns?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the Battle Royale.
Leslie Knope,Right here.

Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Soaring Falcon"" is in its final stages."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? That wasn't the deal."
Leslie Knope,"Pour me one, too, then."
Leslie Knope,Let me in here.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna join you and if I win, Ron stays here with us."
Leslie Knope,Poison! Ugh! I made a mistake.
Leslie Knope,I made a mistake.
Leslie Knope,Not meven clarse.
Leslie Knope,Marvin clods.
Leslie Knope,Glenn Close.
Leslie Knope,"Shh! Go to bed, Jimmy."
Leslie Knope,Wrah! I can't feel my face.
Leslie Knope,My face is numb.
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Leslie Knope,"Everybody prance, now! prance, prance, prance, prance, prance, prance"
Leslie Knope,Ah.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your family's weird."
Leslie Knope,I wrote a book.
Leslie Knope,The first historical guide to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"I wrote it as a reference for myself, but then, my campaign advisor said we should make it a big, wide release."
Leslie Knope,"So we had people contribute, we added pictures, and we removed a lot of my poems and emotional ramblings and pictures of unicorns, and here it is!"
Leslie Knope,One could say that.
Leslie Knope,But should one?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"""Please enjoy a song from the lesbian Afro-Norwegian Funk duo, Nefertiti's Fjord."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,They are terrible.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I expect all of you to buy additional copies.
Leslie Knope,But I wanted the first one that you owned to be delivered and signed by me.
Leslie Knope,"I started thinking about you as a woman, and as a person, and I got carried away."
Leslie Knope,Aren't you sick?
Leslie Knope,Something's off.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I just gave it to you an hour ago.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I have Pawnee Today in an hour."
Leslie Knope,Was my book selected for Joan's cook club?
Leslie Knope,Joan Callamezzo started a book club four years ago.
Leslie Knope,And now she is the literary tastemaker in the town.
Leslie Knope,"The Time Traveler's Optometrist, by Pawnee's own Penelope Foster."
Leslie Knope,A heartwarming story about a caveman eye doctor who travels to presentday Cincinnati and can see everything but love.
Leslie Knope,Unreadable.
Leslie Knope,"Then Joan slaps her sticker on it, best seller, four years in a row."
Leslie Knope,You told me you could get me that sticker.
Leslie Knope,Did you get it?
Leslie Knope,That's impossible.
Leslie Knope,I checked every detail with the historical society.
Leslie Knope,Did she say what it was?
Leslie Knope,"Well, she's not gonna getch me."
Leslie Knope,"Joan Callamezzo claims there is a mistake in my book, which there is not, and so now, she's trying to get me on a tiny technicality."
Leslie Knope,"So just in case there is a mistake, which there is not, I need all of you factchecking every single detail."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need you to hit the road and reinterview everyone who lives out of town."
Leslie Knope,"The rest of you, call me as soon as you find the mistake that does not exist."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I was born and raised here, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"And I love the town so much, I literally wrote the book on it."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, stick it."
Leslie Knope,Stick the sticker.
Leslie Knope,Stick the
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I was born in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,I'd stake my reputation on it.
Leslie Knope,"I have to tell you, this feels like gotcha journalism."
Leslie Knope,That way.
Leslie Knope,"You put ""gotcha"" on my face."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Not the gotcha dancers.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, Tom, you stay here, stay on Joan."
Leslie Knope,Get that sticker.
Leslie Knope,"Chris, Andy, we're gonna stay on schedule, and we're gonna do some damage control."
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming.
Leslie Knope,"Our journey begins on page one, the preface."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what you heard, ma'am, the truth is, I was born here."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't carry my birth certificate around with me"
Leslie Knope,I am back from where I came from!
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous!
Leslie Knope,I'm from here!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,13% believe I'm crazy eyed? What? Why?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, I can end this now."
Leslie Knope,Here's my birth certificate.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's the county Pawnee is in.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Don't make me go to Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Eagleton is the land of rich, snobby jerks."
Leslie Knope,There's a whole chapter about it in my book.
Leslie Knope,I could write a second book about Eagleton and how stupid it is.
Leslie Knope,"And I'd call it Eagleton: The land of rich, snobby jerks."
Leslie Knope,"Take it down a notch, Alexis."
Leslie Knope,I need a copy of my birth certificate.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"I hate this stupid town with all its stupid, terrible people."
Leslie Knope,I need that birth certificate.
Leslie Knope,Andy
Leslie Knope,Nice!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so."
Leslie Knope,"Leslie Barbara Knope, born January 18th, to Robert and Marlene Knope, in Eagleton, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,I'm from Eagleton!
Leslie Knope,Is it true mom?
Leslie Knope,Was I born in Eagleton?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Mom, why didn't you tell me?"
Leslie Knope,I care.
Leslie Knope,The people of Pawnee care.
Leslie Knope,I wrote on the cover of my book that I was born in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"I went on Pawnee today, and I called Joan a liar!"
Leslie Knope,I'm the liar.
Leslie Knope,I'm worse than a liar.
Leslie Knope,I'm an Eagletonian.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I wonder who else was born in Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Voldemort, probably."
Leslie Knope,The sticker is the least of my problems.
Leslie Knope,"If I come clean about where I'm from, then my political career is over."
Leslie Knope,I'd like to apologize to those that I've misled.
Leslie Knope,"I thought I was telling the truth, but, sadly, I was born in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"I learned something, Joan."
Leslie Knope,It's not where you're born.
Leslie Knope,It's where you're from.
Leslie Knope,"When I was nine years old, I broke my arm."
Leslie Knope,Sledding on that giant hill behind Kernston's rubber nipple factory.
Leslie Knope,"You know, ""nipple hill""."
Leslie Knope,It gets very slippery there.
Leslie Knope,Especially when it's wet.
Leslie Knope,"And, Jim."
Leslie Knope,Jim Kabernick.
Leslie Knope,I know Jim.
Leslie Knope,"Jim and I have gone to school together since we were, like, three years old."
Leslie Knope,Do you remember when you peed your pants in second grade
Leslie Knope,"You stuck your underwear in your drawer, and you got really embarrassed, and then the teacher came over and pulled them out."
Leslie Knope,"And everybody called you ""the gerbil"" because you always smelled like soiled wood chips?"
Leslie Knope,The point is you can't choose where you were born.
Leslie Knope,But you can choose where you live.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,I always have.
Leslie Knope,I always will.
Leslie Knope,And that's why I wrote a book about it.
Leslie Knope,And that's why I'm running for City Council.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm not crazy."
Leslie Knope,"I know Pawnee isn't Paris, or London, or Chicago."
Leslie Knope,But it's a great place to live.
Leslie Knope,And work.
Leslie Knope,And serving the goofballs in this town is an honor and a privilege.
Leslie Knope,"And, yes, every town claims its diner's waffles are the best in the world, but somewhere, in some town, there really are the best waffles in the world."
Leslie Knope,"So delicious, and rich, and golden brown that anyone who tasted them would decide never to leave that town."
Leslie Knope,"Somewhere, those waffles exist."
Leslie Knope,Why can't it be here?
Leslie Knope,Joan put us in her book club.
Leslie Knope,Although I could do without this.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,You're doing great.
Leslie Knope,Godspeed.
Leslie Knope,He just seemed so happy.
Leslie Knope,"In a town as old as Pawnee, there's a lot of history in every acre."
Leslie Knope,"This wooded area is the site of, um, the murder, actually, of Nathaniel Bixby Mark."
Leslie Knope,"He was a pioneer who was killed by a tribe of Wamapoke Indians, after he traded them a baby for what is now Indianapolis."
Leslie Knope,They cut his face off.
Leslie Knope,And they made it into a dream catcher.
Leslie Knope,And they made his legs into rain sticks.
Leslie Knope,"And that's the great thing about Indians, back then, is, they used every part of the pioneer."
Leslie Knope,Today is a great day for the Knope family.
Leslie Knope,My mother is being honored at a banquet with the Tellenson Award for Excellence in Pawnee Public Service.
Leslie Knope,"The award's named after the legendary Tony Tellenson, who was a great man."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, is a great man."
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am glad that they're keeping him alive."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I already know, the one on the left where the American flag is."
Leslie Knope,"But I think we could be a multigenerational political dynasty, you and I, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Like the Kennedys, or the Bushes."
Leslie Knope,Minus the drinking problem.
Leslie Knope,I mean no disrespect.
Leslie Knope,This is very exciting.
Leslie Knope,This is a big night.
Leslie Knope,"We are gonna meet some powerful people tonight, so take this down."
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mother.
Leslie Knope,How important are speeches?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, ask the Gettysburg Address."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it didn't answer your call?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was in the Smithsonian.
Leslie Knope,It was a great learning experience because my mom casts a long shadow.
Leslie Knope,Read that part back to me.
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't say ""learning disabled."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I've lost my momentum now."
Leslie Knope,"Um, all right, let's start from the top."
Leslie Knope,What's the first sentence again?
Leslie Knope,"I never said ""obese."""
Leslie Knope,"I said ""is my mother."""
Leslie Knope,"I need to mention the park and in a very subtle way, I need to let people know that I'm forging my own path and I have my own subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to sound braggy.
Leslie Knope,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, I start off with, ""I am Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am the Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and to be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,To the max.
Leslie Knope,It is the most exclusive local government event of the year.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,The Tellensons is like the Oscars times the Grammys plus the Super Bowl.
Leslie Knope,I'm headed to the salon right now.
Leslie Knope,Salvatore Manfrelotti has been cutting hair across from Pioneer Hall since 1958.
Leslie Knope,All the movers and shakers who come through Pawnee have sat in that chair at one point or another.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's the guy that made Larry Bird look the way he does."
Leslie Knope,"So, what's the inside scoop, Salvatore?"
Leslie Knope,Classic Salvatore!
Leslie Knope,"Uh, no."
Leslie Knope,This is my first official political haircut.
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation."
Leslie Knope,That depends.
Leslie Knope,Would you call being her daughter related?
Leslie Knope,"Well, my mom is being honored tonight."
Leslie Knope,"So, in a way, I am also being honored."
Leslie Knope,"And I just wanted to mix things up a little bit, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Pin it up, something sassy, but powerful and dynastic."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April."
Leslie Knope,"I'm off the clock, April."
Leslie Knope,You don't need to call me sir.
Leslie Knope,"Salvatore calls this hairdo ""The Mayor."""
Leslie Knope,"And yes, I will wear my hair like this when I am the first female mayor of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,You look great.
Leslie Knope,We look great.
Leslie Knope,Everyone's looking at us.
Leslie Knope,You want a drink?
Leslie Knope,That's former City Councilman Frank Schnable.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we are in rarified air tonight, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Rarified air!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Be cool, be cool!"
Leslie Knope,"Hello, former City Councilman."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I am the daughter of the honoree this evening.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Table 12."
Leslie Knope,"Can I get a ""what what?"""
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I was going for wow.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, don't look."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I said don't look."
Leslie Knope,Seated behind us is Janine Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,We need to rezone the pit to turn it into a park and she's on the zoning board.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, what a night!"
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,This is so cool.
Leslie Knope,At that table are all eight living Tellenson Award winners.
Leslie Knope,"Bert Winfield, Geoffrey Morglesberg, Quentin Arble, Dawn Krink, Michael Holloway, I don't know who that is, that's somebody's wife, Horace Rangel, Wilmer Vism and Oscar Pfortmiller."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Oscar Pfortmiller is dead.
Leslie Knope,"That's his disappointing son, Theo."
Leslie Knope,Another dynasty.
Leslie Knope,What a testament to my mother.
Leslie Knope,"If a bomb went off in here, it would definitely make the Indianapolis papers."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to get me to talk to Janine Restrepo."
Leslie Knope,She's right behind us and she could rezone our park.
Leslie Knope,"Brilliant political strategy, Mark."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should mention her massive weight loss.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Madame Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope from the Parks-- What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I think it would be a good idea to have a multi-use community park."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm Marlene Griggs-Knope and I will destroy you all!"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,You like?
Leslie Knope,I went to Salvatore.
Leslie Knope,Usually.
Leslie Knope,But this time he made an exception.
Leslie Knope,This is Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope,"So, I need your advice."
Leslie Knope,I'm seated near Janine Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,I think she could be very useful.
Leslie Knope,What's my in?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"It's 22 minutes long, with the song."
Leslie Knope,I could cut the song.
Leslie Knope,The song's cut.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, politics!"
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,My mom is crazy good at this.
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,I'll make her feel like a human dinner roll.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, Marlene's daughter."
Leslie Knope,"Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom, but she's so much more than that."
Leslie Knope,She's also my mother.
Leslie Knope,"And together, we are the Knopes."
Leslie Knope,"And if you weren't thinking it, you probably already said it, ""political dynasty."""
Leslie Knope,Please save your applause until the end.
Leslie Knope,There are so many luminaries here tonight.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the list includes such amazing people as zoning board member Janine Restrepo, and others."
Leslie Knope,"In conclusion, my mom is Marlene Griggs-Knope."
Leslie Knope,And I am just so psyched that Janine Restrepo is here.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, Mom."
Leslie Knope,"And you, too, Janine."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I wish I could talk.
Leslie Knope,Moving and shaking.
Leslie Knope,Janine?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"No, but I am a big fan."
Leslie Knope,I'm Marlene's daughter.
Leslie Knope,"Right, and I would love to speak to you about the ways we can improve our city."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Next month, then."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,It went really well with Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,She said I should call her and we can set something up next month.
Leslie Knope,Secretary.
Leslie Knope,"That's good, right?"
Leslie Knope,Secretary makes her schedule.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That is not conduct worthy of the zoning board.
Leslie Knope,"Well, everyone has their problems."
Leslie Knope,"So, what should my next tactic be?"
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could do that.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I want to win a Tellenson Award some day."
Leslie Knope,They don't give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann, where's Mark?"
Leslie Knope,Shoot!
Leslie Knope,"I have a tough assignment, and I need his help with it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, apparently Restrepo was trying to blow us off, so my mom has a plan."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna twist her arm a little bit.
Leslie Knope,She's trying to cover up for the fact that she has a husband who likes to vroom vroom vroom vroom and glug glug glug glug glug.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just gonna get tough with her, Tellenson style."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you don't understand politics."
Leslie Knope,"Look, nursing is easy."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"You just go to work, and people come in, and you heal them."
Leslie Knope,"But politics is different, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to bring the pain.
Leslie Knope,You can't let yourself get taken advantage of.
Leslie Knope,I don't think so.
Leslie Knope,You just do everything your boyfriend tells you to do?
Leslie Knope,Make any pancakes lately?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and he's got three crutches."
Leslie Knope,And one of them is you!
Leslie Knope,And the other two are crutches.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, former Councilman Schnable."
Leslie Knope,I think we're gonna meet a little earlier than what you said.
Leslie Knope,How about Monday?
Leslie Knope,Not good enough.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,I know about things.
Leslie Knope,Drive much?
Leslie Knope,Your husband.
Leslie Knope,Does he drive much out of state? I know that your husband is a drunk driver.
Leslie Knope,My mom told me.
Leslie Knope,Uh Just saying.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what came over me.
Leslie Knope,I hope your husband gets help and that you have a long and happy marriage.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"I just wanted to tell you that I didn't go through with it, blackmailing that woman."
Leslie Knope,"I tried, but I just couldn't do it."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,The people who win awards aren't always the best people.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I think Ann and I are really good people, and someday others will see that and we'll get our due."
Leslie Knope,Would I like to win a Tellenson Award like my mom did? Sure.
Leslie Knope,"But my dad never won an award, and he was always happy."
Leslie Knope,"He lives in Florida, in a cemetery."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, my mom is alive and I love her."
Leslie Knope,She's one tough cookie.
Leslie Knope,"That's why everybody calls her ""The Iron [bleep] of Pawnee."""
Leslie Knope,Fondly.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's time to give out the badges."
Leslie Knope,"Um, let's see."
Leslie Knope,"Emily, you get the badge for most community service."
Leslie Knope,"To Casey, the best penguin blog badge."
Leslie Knope,"To Abigail, flyest hairstyle."
Leslie Knope,And Ann gets the badge for second flyest hairstyle.
Leslie Knope,I'll say.
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, a plucky fifthgrader wanted to join the Pawnee Rangers, but their executive council said what obnoxious jerks always say."
Leslie Knope,"""No."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is males only."""
Leslie Knope,"""Go start your own club."""
Leslie Knope,She couldn't.
Leslie Knope,So I did.
Leslie Knope,"We're called the Pawnee Goddesses, and we're freaking awesome."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron, whose club do you think is better, yours or mine?"
Leslie Knope,The answer is mine.
Leslie Knope,Say mine is better.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, but it is."
Leslie Knope,Your club made it a competition when they kept girls out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my stars."
Leslie Knope,I'm just a little lady.
Leslie Knope,My fragile constitution cannot handle the fearsome outdoors.
Leslie Knope,Who's Leslie?
Leslie Knope,"My name is Annabelle Vandergraf, and, y'all, I just fall to pieces when the sun shines on my haired."
Leslie Knope,"Well, my awesome goddesses don't want to be distracted by losers."
Leslie Knope,"Say my club is better, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,My club is better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Say it's better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Say it's better.
Leslie Knope,Say my club is better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Give it up.
Leslie Knope,Whose club is better?
Leslie Knope,Mine.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,You know it.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Ladies!
Leslie Knope,The goddess cabin has never looked better.
Leslie Knope,This year's cabin refurbishment badge is going to be hotly contested.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so what did everybody make for their loosely structured craft time?"
Leslie Knope,Lauren?
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Lauren, that's so good!"
Leslie Knope,I really wouldn't want to follow that.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ann's keeping us warm."
Leslie Knope,And that's important.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,What was your craft?
Leslie Knope,"This homemade bulgogi is so delicious, Kayla."
Leslie Knope,This is the best Korean food I've ever had.
Leslie Knope,I would say it's almost as good as lukewarm beans from a can.
Leslie Knope,"Right, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"Goddesses, let's go over our schedule for this afternoon."
Leslie Knope,"We have hiking, and then capture the flag, and then a puppet show about the Bill of Rights set to ""Party in the USA"" by Miley Cyrus, and then we have lasso training, and a s'moresoff."
Leslie Knope,"Great pillow fight, girls."
Leslie Knope,That was one of our best ones yet.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Now it's time for awards.
Leslie Knope,Lulu gets the golden pillow.
Leslie Knope,And the silver pillow goes to Janie.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, what is it?"
Leslie Knope,I did it!
Leslie Knope,My club is officially the best club.
Leslie Knope,"I would give myself a merit badge that says ""Best Club Founder,"" but I don't have one, so I'm going to give myself ""Prettiest eyes"" as a placeholder."
Leslie Knope,"I secretly always wanted this badge, so it works out great."
Leslie Knope,"Well, see, the thing is this club is for girls only."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you should start your own club, for boys."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Darren."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, I just wanted to thank you for not cheering when I sent Darren away."
Leslie Knope,"In a sense, but it's a little bit more complicated than"
Leslie Knope,"Come on, goddesses."
Leslie Knope,We just struck a huge blow for equality by proving that we were better than them.
Leslie Knope,"Great idea, Lauren."
Leslie Knope,"I said, ""great idea, Lauren."""
Leslie Knope,I've taught them too well.
Leslie Knope,I've created a mob of little Leslie Knope monsters.
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud.
Leslie Knope,And a little annoyed.
Leslie Knope,But mostly proud.
Leslie Knope,70 30.
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to wonder weekend's firstever public forum.
Leslie Knope,Our topic today?
Leslie Knope,"Should the amazing goddesses take pity on the once powerful Pawnee Rangers, and let them into our clearly superior organization?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your opening statement."
Leslie Knope,Powerful stuff.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's open up the floor to debate.
Leslie Knope,"Who yes, Abigail."
Leslie Knope,"Mmm, interesting."
Leslie Knope,Casey?
Leslie Knope,I see where you're coming from.
Leslie Knope,Let's hear from a ranger.
Leslie Knope,Anyone?
Leslie Knope,Darren?
Leslie Knope,"The goddesses are making some well informed statements, but the most compelling point is from Darren, about the candy."
Leslie Knope,We have amazing candy in there.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,The puppies for the puppy party that we're having in our cabin?
Leslie Knope,Those puppies?
Leslie Knope,I am a goddess.
Leslie Knope,A glorious female warrior.
Leslie Knope,Queen of all that I survey.
Leslie Knope,"Enemies of fairness and equality, hear my womanly roar."
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, you are now goddesses."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! Now, have yourselves a puppy party."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Can I sit down? Look, I didn't mean for this to happen."
Leslie Knope,"I have a lot of respect for the Pawnee Rangers, even if they were jerks five years ago."
Leslie Knope,You're not a jerk.
Leslie Knope,You're a good troop leader.
Leslie Knope,That's not true.
Leslie Knope,Ron! Come fish with us!
Leslie Knope,"Come on! Come do that thing where you catch one with your hands! I've seen him do it, it's incredible."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on! We need you to help us have fun!"
Leslie Knope,Are you tough as nails? Would you rather sleep on a bed of pine needles than a mattress?
Leslie Knope,"Do you find video games pointless and shopping malls stupid? Do you march to the beat of your own drummer? Did you make the drum yourself? If so, you might just have what it takes to be a Swanson."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee's most hardcore outdoor club starts today.
Leslie Knope,Boys and girls welcome.
Leslie Knope,I hate talking about myself.
Leslie Knope,"When you work in government, people often suspect that you're anti-business."
Leslie Knope,"So I'm throwing a little meet and greet with business owners, and I've asked Tom's company to help."
Leslie Knope,"Here's my opening line: ""Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, and I'm in the business of being city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,I'm not going to use that.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, from Kernston Rubber Nipples."
Leslie Knope,"""The nipple king."""
Leslie Knope,I've heard of Martin Kernston.
Leslie Knope,I know a little bit about him.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it depends, Flirtman is more of a confidant"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm on it."
Leslie Knope,Allergic to chestnuts.
Leslie Knope,And good haircuts.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this is not what I pictured at all."
Leslie Knope,This looks like a party for Entertainment 720.
Leslie Knope,Is Entertainment 720 running for office?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then shouldn't my face be on these rugs?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, now is not a time for you to explore your weird dreams."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"I want all of this gone, all of it."
Leslie Knope,Except that cake.
Leslie Knope,Keep that cake here.
Leslie Knope,Just scrape off the words.
Leslie Knope,"Although I've not worked with you professionally, as a private citizen, I have personally patronized each and every one of your establishments."
Leslie Knope,"That's 'cause I don't hate myself, Tanya."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I know I should be chasing your vote, but I stand behind my decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things."
Leslie Knope,And I think I have a lot of support in the community for that.
Leslie Knope,"Despite the fact that this seems like a party for Tom's face, uh, I think it's going pretty well."
Leslie Knope,"When in doubt, in Pawnee, slam salad."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just especially thankful that you could come, Mr. President."
Leslie Knope,Martin.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Well It was a team effort.
Leslie Knope,I barely did anything.
Leslie Knope,I held them back actually.
Leslie Knope,They succeeded despite me.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I worked very hard on that event.
Leslie Knope,I'm just.
Leslie Knope,Bureaucrats s aren't used to bragging about themselves.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, come over here and talk about how great I am."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, tell Martin how hard I worked on the Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,No one says that.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't like to throw around the word ""butthead"" too often."
Leslie Knope,"If you call everybody a butthead, then it kind of loses its impact."
Leslie Knope,But I can say without hesitation that Tom is being a real dick.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,You stole the nipple king.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks a lot, traitor."
Leslie Knope,I have a better idea.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go over to one of your rugs and sit on your own face?
Leslie Knope,"I don't need your ""help"" anymore."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has suffered through a tough economy.
Leslie Knope,"And what has kept our town alive is you, the small businessman."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm not referring to your stature, Gary."
Leslie Knope,You are a giant in this community.
Leslie Knope,So many business represented here today.
Leslie Knope,"Food and Stuff, JJ's Diner, Glenmore Discount Cemetery, uh, Tramp Stamp Tattoos, Enormous Kenny's Fried Dough Stand and Mobile Phone Emporium."
Leslie Knope,Who else?
Leslie Knope,Sue's Salads.
Leslie Knope,Smooth Operator Bikini Waxes.
Leslie Knope,Jeff's Savings and Loan
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, listen to me."
Leslie Knope,Turn that off or give me the remote right now.
Leslie Knope,You're lucky that Martin Kernston is here because you're gonna need another nipple.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, um I know that video seemed like the rantings of a lunatic pretending to be Mark zuckerberg"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, we're not gonna waste any more of your time."
Leslie Knope,"Um, Mr. President."
Leslie Knope,I just want to apologize for the actions of that little weasel.
Leslie Knope,"There you are, you little bastard."
Leslie Knope,Get out of there right now.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, get out of your stupid limousine hot tub right now, or we are no longer friends."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, then I'm getting in."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me.
Leslie Knope,You know what you are?
Leslie Knope,"You're a selfish little punk, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just because you want something doesn't mean that everybody has to bow to listen to me!
Leslie Knope,You didn't even let me have my one night.
Leslie Knope,Look at me!
Leslie Knope,I don't want to see your face.
Leslie Knope,Look at me.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to see your face!
Leslie Knope,I've been looking at your face all night.
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man."
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe we should get out of this hot tub."
Leslie Knope,What happened?
Leslie Knope,"With the company, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know what you need?
Leslie Knope,Some good oldfashioned comfort food.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I thought you guys were doing great."
Leslie Knope,I remember trying to hire you once.
Leslie Knope,And you said you were all booked up.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard."
Leslie Knope,Kind of seems like regular sight should have caught that one.
Leslie Knope,"Also, your logo, it's the worst logo I've ever seen."
Leslie Knope,It doesn't make any sense.
Leslie Knope,It's gibberish.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Tom, you're a smart guy."
Leslie Knope,And charming.
Leslie Knope,Occasionally.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna have a lot more good ideas.
Leslie Knope,Of my life?
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's eat and go."
Leslie Knope,Didn't I ask for whipped cream on this?
Leslie Knope,Ma'am?
Leslie Knope,"Tom Haverford is a selfish, unctuous, sleazy, self-promoting, good-hearted, secretly kind and wonderful tiny little person."
Leslie Knope,He went to Kernston's office and basically begged him to meet with me again.
Leslie Knope,I think he technically might have bribed him.
Leslie Knope,"But hey, you know, whatever works."
Leslie Knope,"It was Mary Pickford who once said, ""This thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down."""
Leslie Knope,Tom won't be down for long.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I loved it."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna watch it every day for the rest of my life.
Leslie Knope,"And when I die, I'm gonna project it on my tombstone."
Leslie Knope,"Again, Andy, you don't need to bow."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Herb, what can I do you for?"
Leslie Knope,You do?
Leslie Knope,Aw nuts.
Leslie Knope,You sure it's tomorrow?
Leslie Knope,"Not giving me much notice Herb, let me see what I can do."
Leslie Knope,"For a while in the 1970s, our town was run by a freaky cult."
Leslie Knope,And every few years the remaining members predicted the world's gonna end.
Leslie Knope,And they have an all-night vigil in the park.
Leslie Knope,It's super annoying.
Leslie Knope,"Turns out when you think the world's ending, you don't aim so carefully in the portapotties."
Leslie Knope,"Tonight the follower of Reasonablism, will be joining together to await the return of Zorp."
Leslie Knope,The giant lizard God who will destoy the Earth with his cleansing fire of judgment.
Leslie Knope,"Also, light refreshments will be served."
Leslie Knope,"It says they've got turkey sandwiches, and the nectar of a thousand sorrows."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, I'm going to miss you, enormous chair."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I loved it. Felt like a tiny king."
Leslie Knope,"Well, they figure if people criticize them, it'll seem like they're attacking something very reasonable."
Leslie Knope,"Look, there's nothing to worry about, they've said that the world is going to end 15 times."
Leslie Knope,And the only bad thing that's ever happened on any of those dates is Lance Armstrong dumping Sheryl Crow.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it looks like we're kind of forced to hang out with each other."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmhmm, totally get it."
Leslie Knope,Definitely get it.
Leslie Knope,Ben and I don't hang out much these days.
Leslie Knope,"Big deal, lots of people don't hang out."
Leslie Knope,Jerry and April.
Leslie Knope,"Obama and Madonna, probably."
Leslie Knope,We're in good company.
Leslie Knope,Headline idea.
Leslie Knope,"""It's the end of the world as they know it, but Pawnee feels fine."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, ""Zorp Shmorp!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Doomsday prediction falls flat as citizens spend pleasant evening enjoying one of Pawnee's finest parks."""
Leslie Knope,"Right, okay let's go with the first one."
Leslie Knope,Chris?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He's actually dating Jerry's daughter.
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm not I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,"He's, um, a man and he's a worker."
Leslie Knope,"And he is, we've never discussed sex, so. It's... we've always just been very business-like, so... Your guess is as good nay, better than mine."
Leslie Knope,The end.
Leslie Knope,By Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Happy to help.
Leslie Knope,The world is ending.
Leslie Knope,"Oh boy, I know how this goes."
Leslie Knope,I know how Shauna operates.
Leslie Knope,"She smiles, and then they fall in love, and then they get married, and then she changes her name to Shauna Malwae-Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,Or he's going to be really progressive and change his name to Ben Wyatt-Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so annoyed that he would hypothetically do that."
Leslie Knope,"What's that, what do you mean just talking?"
Leslie Knope,He's smiling and she's being very charming.
Leslie Knope,Is she more charming than me?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, if you say yes, I will kick, I swear to God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so just because I can't go out with him, someone else can?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,My God.
Leslie Knope,They're gonna have sex in five minutes.
Leslie Knope,I've gotta stop this.
Leslie Knope,I've got to keep them away from each other for the rest of their lives.
Leslie Knope,Unclear!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you two are still talking?"
Leslie Knope,Ben hasn't bored you to death by now.
Leslie Knope,So boring.
Leslie Knope,Keep your pants on.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, keep your pants on, girl!"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, those are really nice pants."
Leslie Knope,I really like your pants.
Leslie Knope,Where'd you get them?
Leslie Knope,Do you want to go buy some more pants?
Leslie Knope,"Or, um, walk away from here?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's where all the losers are going."
Leslie Knope,"Hur Well, then you should stay here then."
Leslie Knope,Because you can't go.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what if you're not here when Zorp shows up?"
Leslie Knope,"Boy, would your face be red."
Leslie Knope,You want to be here for that.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What an unbelievably unpleasant person.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, where you going?"
Leslie Knope,Where you headed off to?
Leslie Knope,Do you want to play a fun game with me that I made up called chessrisk?
Leslie Knope,"It's half chess, half risk and takes like 15 hours to play."
Leslie Knope,I okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,I forgot I have a thing I need to show you.
Leslie Knope,I need to bring you there right now it's so amazing.
Leslie Knope,It's going to freak you out.
Leslie Knope,"It's, uh, it's something that we need to get in my car and go to, so let's do that."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the thing that I told you about with Ben.
Leslie Knope,"No spoilers, Ann."
Leslie Knope,She's been there before.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Just out of curiosity, where's your favorite place to go like ever?"
Leslie Knope,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,We're at the special place!
Leslie Knope,"Well, here we are."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"No, this is a great gas station."
Leslie Knope,This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.
Leslie Knope,"I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M."
Leslie Knope,"Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I just knew you were a big fan of financial records, so, you're welcome."
Leslie Knope,I'm showing you a part of Rock and Roll history.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What would you do if the world was really going to end?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Can I speak with you about a personal matter?
Leslie Knope,I lost my mind tonight.
Leslie Knope,I tried to screw up even the potential of Ben dating someone else.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we broke up because of me."
Leslie Knope,"But I have to tell you, Ron If the world was ending tomorrow, I'd want to be with him."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I made my decision. I need to stick to it.
Leslie Knope,It's just the thought of him with someone else is making me miserable.
Leslie Knope,That does make me feel better.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Herb."
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep thinks you're cute.
Leslie Knope,That's why I took you to Mick Jagger's abandoned gas station.
Leslie Knope,"Because she thinks you're cute, and I was afraid you guys were gonna make out and have babies, and I had no right to do that to you or your future children."
Leslie Knope,And it wasn't until just now that I realized the romantic part of our relationship is over.
Leslie Knope,So I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"And, uh, why don't you tell Shauna to make herself decent and I'll apologize to her as well."
Leslie Knope,See what I did?
Leslie Knope,I'm very sneaky.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, well."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, gosh, I'm as disappointed as you are, Herb."
Leslie Knope,You don't say.
Leslie Knope,"well, math is hard."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's see what we've got."
Leslie Knope,"Um, oh, on the 19th we can't give you the park."
Leslie Knope,We have a Spring spectacular free ice cream giveaway.
Leslie Knope,That is free.
Leslie Knope,"End of World, May 20th."
Leslie Knope,Already did.
Leslie Knope,"Oh hey, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Have you seen my complete collection of all 193 national flags? Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Here they are.
Leslie Knope,"So, I've been asked to run this year's Model UN at Pawnee Central High School."
Leslie Knope,Attendance has been low.
Leslie Knope,"And if I don't make it awesome, they may cancel it."
Leslie Knope,I wonder if I'm gonna make it awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Or I can be South Korea, you can be Bangladesh."
Leslie Knope,You can form like a Trans-Asiatic alliance.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"Amen, brother."
Leslie Knope,"Let's go back to plan ""A."""
Leslie Knope,"I'll be Denmark, you be Peru."
Leslie Knope,I need a few more volunteers.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, will you be Iceland?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, how about Japan?"
Leslie Knope,Why don't you be Finland?
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"No, you're gonna be South Africa or Pakistan."
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"You be South Africa, and you can also secretly run the moon."
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,You wanna join us?
Leslie Knope,Look!
Leslie Knope,I'll let you be America.
Leslie Knope,"Bonjour, Madame Ambassadeur."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I really wouldn't describe myself as a Model UN legend.
Leslie Knope,I'd go with icon.
Leslie Knope,Or hero.
Leslie Knope,You've all been preparing for months for this year's geopolitical scenario global food crisis.
Leslie Knope,"Security Council, we need you to lead us, or billions of people will starve to death."
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, have fun."
Leslie Knope,"Due to my campaign, the romantic aspect of our relationship is over."
Leslie Knope,And I'm totally fine with that.
Leslie Knope,But Ben and I have so much in common.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we're amazing friends."
Leslie Knope,And friendship is better because friends help you move.
Leslie Knope,They drive you to the airport.
Leslie Knope,Boyfriends just love you and marry you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait a minute."
Leslie Knope,I think I have it.
Leslie Knope,What if we dropped interest rates.
Leslie Knope,Would that help you?
Leslie Knope,"Underexaggerate much, France?"
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, William."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Um They want me to do a photo op for the campaign so I can bolster my education credentials.
Leslie Knope,Can we just press pause here?
Leslie Knope,I'm not really sure.
Leslie Knope,Can you just tread water until I'm ready?
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, buddy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay this should probably only take five more minutes."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,It's just important.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,I'm back.
Leslie Knope,"Or, as they say in Denmark ""I'm back."""
Leslie Knope,Most people speak English.
Leslie Knope,So are you guys ready to polish off this treaty?
Leslie Knope,I got cut out of my own treaty?
Leslie Knope,The nation of Denmark would like to formerly request a summit with the nation of Peru over there by the refreshment table.
Leslie Knope,Because the nation of Denmark needs a juice box.
Leslie Knope,I am shocked an appalled by the actions of the honorable delegate from Peru.
Leslie Knope,But that was in a romantic way.
Leslie Knope,We can still spend time together as friends.
Leslie Knope,Why not?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I understand where he's coming from."
Leslie Knope,"But I have been nothing but straightforward with him, and if anyone in the entire world should understand the difficult position I'm in, it's It's just I've made an effort and I've shared my flags with him, and suddenly, he doesn't want to be friends?"
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,That leaves me with only one option.
Leslie Knope,Just excuse me for a
Leslie Knope,Attention.
Leslie Knope,This is an urgent world matter.
Leslie Knope,"Due to a recent betrayal, my homeland, the great state of Denmark, has officially decided to declare war on Peru."
Leslie Knope,"Scandinavian brothers, on my signal."
Leslie Knope,Unleash hell!
Leslie Knope,"What we need to focus on is how to destroy Peru, specifically one person who lives there."
Leslie Knope,"Global politics can change, and scenarios can arise and suddenly you're just like, ""wait, I thought this one thing, but look over there."""
Leslie Knope,"""That's a different thing, and it's changing everything,"" and I'm like, ""What?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Hold up."""
Leslie Knope,Who has tanks for me?
Leslie Knope,Food schmood.
Leslie Knope,This is war.
Leslie Knope,"God, it's time for you to nut up, Switzerland."
Leslie Knope,"Well, well, well, look who is brave enough to show his face in Europe."
Leslie Knope,I agree.
Leslie Knope,"You betrayed me, and you went behind my back, and now you need to pay."
Leslie Knope,Do I stutter?
Leslie Knope,the only thing I will be waving is your decapitated head on a stick in front of your weeping mother!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, cry me a river."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"That's no problemo, Peru, because Denmark no longer recognizes the authority of this international gang of thugs."
Leslie Knope,And history will be unkind to those who stand opposed to justice.
Leslie Knope,"Together, we stand and I ask all of you who is ready to join the Coalition of the Willing?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,We got the freaking moon.
Leslie Knope,"What are you gonna do without tides, Peru?"
Leslie Knope,"So the Coalition of the Willing is Denmark, Botswana, and the Moon."
Leslie Knope,"Now, here's what we're gonna do."
Leslie Knope,Ben is probably shoring up his support in South America.
Leslie Knope,"While he does that, we are gonna make sure--"
Leslie Knope,Madame Ambassadeur Pourquoi?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He's being a jerk.
Leslie Knope,I hate it here.
Leslie Knope,Can't wait to graduate.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"It's bad enough that we can't be together, but the thought of us not being friends is Is just too crappy for me to handle."
Leslie Knope,I just need you to be in my life.
Leslie Knope,You're too important to me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I propose a treaty that states that we have a fun conversation once a day at work for five minutes."
Leslie Knope,Please do that.
Leslie Knope,What do we do with those kids? We totally ruined their club.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, how are we gonna get Kathy Ireland to do naked aerobics for them?"
Leslie Knope,"Ah, France, bienvenue."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And you have every right to be, but we're hoping what we're gonna show you right now will make up for that."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee City Council chambers.
Leslie Knope,The nicest room in City Hall by a factor of like a million.
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,Sit down.
Leslie Knope,"Which, for the record, Denmark would have won, but that's neither here nor there."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks to a coordinated effort between the parks department and the city manager's office, three months from now, we are gonna hold a State-wide Model U.N."
Leslie Knope,"In this room, and you're gonna run the show."
Leslie Knope,And we will just be not here.
Leslie Knope,Or taking some small countries.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Not here.
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Leslie Knope,Those kids are passionate about something.
Leslie Knope,That's important.
Leslie Knope,"That's all there is, really, is passion."
Leslie Knope,Passion is what makes for good treaties Good relationships Good pizza.
Leslie Knope,Good friends.
Leslie Knope,Good everything.
Leslie Knope,Including wars.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and Gentlemen, ""He was gone but never forgotten."""
Leslie Knope,"""He makes all the ladies want--"" No, I'm not gonna say that."
Leslie Knope,"""Swagger beats and I get the-- Who's the"" All right, forget it."
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Tom Haverford!"
Leslie Knope,"I understand that, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"But the problem is is that Tom came back and Andy's my assistant, so I kinda need him close to me."
Leslie Knope,"Our research shows that our park will draw and I want this to be the most amazing, awe inspiring, fun filled park ever conceived."
Leslie Knope,it is .000003 square miles.
Leslie Knope,"Recently, the last remaining telephone booths in Pawnee were torn down, and on that patch of concrete, I am creating Pawnee's newest tourist attraction The smallest park in Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"The title is currently held by Martin Luther King, Jr."
Leslie Knope,"Park in Terryville, but guess what?"
Leslie Knope,"Terryville sucks old car tires, and so does Martin Luther No, he does not suck old car tires."
Leslie Knope,He was one of the greatest men in history.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sometimes I get competitive.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have about nine things I need to talk to you about."
Leslie Knope,The first is the ribbon cutting ceremony.
Leslie Knope,Do you know who's bringing scissors?
Leslie Knope,Because I cannot tell you how many ceremonies get derailed when people don't bring scissors.
Leslie Knope,Number two
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,We're just working out the kinks.
Leslie Knope,You don't need to decrease your time with me.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, you need to increase your time with me."
Leslie Knope,You need to spend more time with me.
Leslie Knope,That make sense?
Leslie Knope,I think it does.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you'll excuse me, I need to ascertain the whereabouts of some oversized ceremonial scissors."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not even attending the ribboncutting ceremony of a park that we made together."
Leslie Knope,I'm just freaking out.
Leslie Knope,The only thing we have left is work.
Leslie Knope,And now he doesn't want to work together anymore?
Leslie Knope,What does that all mean?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.
Leslie Knope,"No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up, and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year."
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, please, I beg of you."
Leslie Knope,Will you just shut your beautiful pie hole?
Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, let me stare at you while you silently support me on this game plan."
Leslie Knope,Shh
Leslie Knope,Ann Your quiet support means the world to me.
Leslie Knope,As well as your tacit endorsement of all my behaviors.
Leslie Knope,"As a mature, reasonable adult, I understand that this will be the last project that Ben and I are working on together."
Leslie Knope,"So please join us for the grand opening of Pawnee's Smallest Park on November 12th, 2070."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for coming to this very important and what I suspect will be lengthy, meeting."
Leslie Knope,"The proposed park is very small, but we believe we need to investigate every detail."
Leslie Knope,"So if anyone has any questions for me or assistant city manager Ben Wyatt, go right ahead."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Leslie Knope,Where's the fire?
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other first.
Leslie Knope,Tell me about your childhood.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we do, Rose, and you bring up a very good point."
Leslie Knope,Intolerance.
Leslie Knope,Can we be doing more?
Leslie Knope,I'd like to hear from each and every one of you about a time when prejudice has touched your lives.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,What a story.
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?
Leslie Knope,"Anyone Uh, this gentleman wants to say something."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Mel."
Leslie Knope,You're always up in arms about something.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me about what's bothering you.
Leslie Knope,I once hosted a forum about a new bike rack that lasted seven hours.
Leslie Knope,"Now when I need these people to complain, they're done in 45 minutes?"
Leslie Knope,Just preparing for the grand opening of this tiny but very intrusive park.
Leslie Knope,They start at midnight.
Leslie Knope,Who knows when they're gonna end?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't even know the impact of this park, because the city skipped an environmental impact report."
Leslie Knope,So we don't know about traffic problems or sound or lights or crime.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's all a mystery."
Leslie Knope,"I do, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's how I know just how high this conspiracy goes."
Leslie Knope,What can we do about it?
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you asked.
Leslie Knope,I have some ideas.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, where you going, Joe?"
Leslie Knope,"No, get back over there."
Leslie Knope,I'll find you a bottle or something.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know how it goes."
Leslie Knope,It only takes one nut job to get people riled up.
Leslie Knope,"I hate to say this, but I think we're gonna have to do that environmental impact report."
Leslie Knope,They are explicitly demanding it.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God.
Leslie Knope,Everything in my life is going wrong right now.
Leslie Knope,Whose fault is this?
Leslie Knope,I demand to know.
Leslie Knope,Ben thinks that I'm a steamroller?
Leslie Knope,That's unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,How dare he think that I'm a steamroller?
Leslie Knope,"I know, he's going through a phase right now, and eventually we're gonna both be friends again."
Leslie Knope,Working too hard.
Leslie Knope,"I know, Ann, you keep starting all these sentences and not finishing"
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,You love Harry Potter.
Leslie Knope,You've seen all eight movies!
Leslie Knope,"Because you order white wine, and it gives you a headache."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know I do this.
Leslie Knope,I'm the worst.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you should call me a bulldozer rather than a steamroller."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, is it?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess I just need to leave Ben alone."
Leslie Knope,That's what he says he wants.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this steamroller is hanging up her The rolly thing on the front of the machine."
Leslie Knope,What do you what do you call that?
Leslie Knope,Probably.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I wasn't sure you were gonna come.
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to be a little less intense and a little more considerate.
Leslie Knope,"Here, have a seat."
Leslie Knope,But only if you want to.
Leslie Knope,"I never listened to what you wanted, or how you wanted us to be when things Ended between us."
Leslie Knope,"I just decided what I wanted, and I got upset when you didn't want the same thing."
Leslie Knope,"I know that's not fair, and I'm very sorry."
Leslie Knope,"If you don't want to have any more contact with me, I finally understand."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,There is another option.
Leslie Knope,"We could just say ""screw it"" and do this thing for real."
Leslie Knope,I miss you like crazy.
Leslie Knope,I think about you all the time.
Leslie Knope,I want to be with you.
Leslie Knope,"So let's just say ""screw it."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"But I know how I feel, and I want to be with you."
Leslie Knope,But I'm done steamrolling people.
Leslie Knope,This is how I feel.
Leslie Knope,How do you feel?
Leslie Knope,"The point is, Ben and I have been dating on and off for about a year."
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,"Are you hugging me, or are we fighting?"
Leslie Knope,Are you hugging or fighting?
Leslie Knope,Let me know.
Leslie Knope,"""Exemplary""?"
Leslie Knope,That's the word we were thinking of.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,Then don't say it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to get here early, you know, get a feel of the room."
Leslie Knope,So you got here at 3:00 A.M.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't sleep anyway.
Leslie Knope,Is that a present for me?
Leslie Knope,Li'l Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thank you so much for making my life so wonderful."
Leslie Knope,I was talking to him.
Leslie Knope,But also to you.
Leslie Knope,I wish we could go through this together.
Leslie Knope,That's not okay.
Leslie Knope,That's gonna go on my permanent record.
Leslie Knope,I'm not the kind of person that has a permanent record.
Leslie Knope,"For me, a slap on the wrist is like a kick to the nuts."
Leslie Knope,What's gonna happen to you?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Leslie Knope,Marcus Everett Langley was Pawnee's greatest lawyer at the turn of the century.
Leslie Knope,"His nickname was ""Old Stone Face"" because of his steely demeanor and because he got in an accident at the rock quarry and dynamite blew up his face."
Leslie Knope,You seem like you're in a good mood.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're radiating pure joy."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"I freely admit to the relationship, and I will not be fighting the charges that we violated Chris' rule."
Leslie Knope,But we did nothing else wrong or unethical.
Leslie Knope,"In 1849, Sarah Nelson Quindle exposed her elbow outdoors, which was a class ""A"" felony."
Leslie Knope,"Although she felt the law unjust, she acknowledged that she had broken it, and she nobly accepted her punishment to be set adrift on Lake Michigan like a human popsicle."
Leslie Knope,Look how calm she looks.
Leslie Knope,That's how I feel totally zen.
Leslie Knope,"Last May, at your request, Ben and I drove to Indianapolis to bid for the state little league tournament."
Leslie Knope,The night we returned was the first time we kissed each other on each other's mouths.
Leslie Knope,It was excellent.
Leslie Knope,That was unnecessary to add.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.
Leslie Knope,I received adorable nicknames and amazing back rubs.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you mean professionally."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Leslie Knope,Why so many?
Leslie Knope,I've already admitted that I broke your rule.
Leslie Knope,And you think I'm guilty of that?
Leslie Knope,None of those things are true.
Leslie Knope,"And I will prove it, Mr. Traeger."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, we need to counter every charge that Chris has leveled against me."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I need evidence."
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,You don't know what evidence.
Leslie Knope,Next to my desk is a picture of a female politician Bella Abzug.
Leslie Knope,Get the key that's taped to the back of that picture.
Leslie Knope,It opens up my bottom desk drawer in there are some files pay attention.
Leslie Knope,Where are you looking?
Leslie Knope,"Look here, focus here."
Leslie Knope,"Get the files in the drawer, and then get all the file boxes in the office."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Chris has 14 witnesses."
Leslie Knope,I need you to talk to all the department heads and find out who's gonna testify.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,I need you to text me every 30 seconds that everything's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"I broke one rule, and I will accept a slap on the wrist."
Leslie Knope,But when you sit back and let your reputation be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,You go down in history as a frozen whore.
Leslie Knope,I'm fighting.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,You're up next.
Leslie Knope,How is Ben?
Leslie Knope,Is he sad?
Leslie Knope,"You need to cheer him up, Ann."
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,That makes no sense.
Leslie Knope,"There's no killer witness, because we didn't do anything wrong unless someone's planning to lie or slander us."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, just to be safe, find out who it is and silence him."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Let me make it clear.
Leslie Knope,Don't silence him.
Leslie Knope,Just make sure he can't talk.
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Perkins, Chris Traeger has questioned when my relationship with Ben Wyatt began."
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to direct you to your inbox and specifically an email entitled ""yay""."
Leslie Knope,"That's YA and 18 ""Y""s and 44 exclamation points."
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,Intriguing.
Leslie Knope,"Could you play the attachment, please?"
Leslie Knope,In a world on the brink of financial meltdown... In a town unlike any other An adorable man with a cute face and the future president of the United States
Leslie Knope,what?
Leslie Knope,went from being friends to being so much more.
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Ben and I hooked up last night!
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,And I learned how to use iMovie.
Leslie Knope,Call me later!
Leslie Knope,Bye!
Leslie Knope,So what was the date you received that email?
Leslie Knope,May 12th The day after we returned from Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, will you please tell the committee why we were kissing?"
Leslie Knope,But we never had any other romantic contact after that.
Leslie Knope,"No, it wouldn't."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we've been at it for hours."
Leslie Knope,And I did have some problem with my character witnesses.
Leslie Knope,"But other than that, I think I'm winning."
Leslie Knope,I've refuted every one of Chris' claims so far.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, will you please describe what we were wearing the evening you saw us?"
Leslie Knope,"And when you walked into the room, what did it look like?"
Leslie Knope,Did it look like anything romantic had happened?
Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was an office.
Leslie Knope,"City Hall was being fumigated, and we need to pull an allnighter."
Leslie Knope,The only thing that was ravaged were these federal grant proposals that Donna had dropped off earlier.
Leslie Knope,"I've seen over 200 episodes of Law & Order, and it's paying off bigtime."
Leslie Knope,"And by the way, we got the gramps grants."
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It was gonna be such an awesome moment.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ethel, you've been to a million of these ethics trials."
Leslie Knope,What do you think my chances are?
Leslie Knope,Is it ethical for a court stenographer to bet on the outcome of a hearing?
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, there has been a question posed about when my relationship with Ben Wyatt ended."
Leslie Knope,Can you confirm that you own a cabin at 930
Leslie Knope,"Ron, don't be ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,This is very important.
Leslie Knope,Do you own a cabin
Leslie Knope,9301 Cedarcrest Drive
Leslie Knope,Who's here?
Leslie Knope,Tammy two is your killer witness?
Leslie Knope,Please!
Leslie Knope,"You're gonna have to do better Actually, she is a terrifying sociopath who could say or do anything A pretty good killer witness."
Leslie Knope,I think I've proven that the only rule Ben and I broke was dating each other.
Leslie Knope,George Williams?
Leslie Knope,"Who's Oh, George Williams He's just a maintenance worker, NASCAR enthusiast, I believe."
Leslie Knope,"And, oh, interesting tidbit I once bribed him to keep my relationship with Ben quiet."
Leslie Knope,Right
Leslie Knope,What you saw was not what you think it is.
Leslie Knope,"I have a gift certificate, actually, for you."
Leslie Knope,And thank you for your discretion.
Leslie Knope,"George, I notice that you're wearing glasses, yet on the day in question, I don't recall you wearing glasses."
Leslie Knope,Could it be because you weren't wearing glasses?
Leslie Knope,"Can you take your glasses off, please, and read this for us?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, that went terribly."
Leslie Knope,I need to check some facts and figures.
Leslie Knope,I would like to request a 55 day recess.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, my only hope is that in one of these old books, there's some weird, arcane statute or government rule that helps me."
Leslie Knope,"So everybody grab a volume, and let's just read up."
Leslie Knope,Does anyone have anything?
Leslie Knope,Did anybody find anything good?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know we're not supposed to be seen together, but I think Ben could be really helpful with this."
Leslie Knope,Can somebody go get him?
Leslie Knope,"No, he said he'd just be on the other side of that wall."
Leslie Knope,He's probably in the bathroom.
Leslie Knope,"This mural is called Bad Pawnee, Good Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,All the terrible things that have happened in this town's history are on one side.
Leslie Knope,And on the other side are all the good things that have happened.
Leslie Knope,I'm on the bad side.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I'm guilty.
Leslie Knope,I did something bad.
Leslie Knope,I'm a bad person.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, everybody stop reading no more loopholes, no more fighting."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I know I let you down.
Leslie Knope,And I just want to say I'm really sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I think I'm about to get fired, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I have no objections.
Leslie Knope,Just two weeks?
Leslie Knope,I thought I was gonna get fired.
Leslie Knope,I should've gotten fired.
Leslie Knope,Why didn't I get fired?
Leslie Knope,What? Wait.
Leslie Knope,Hang on.
Leslie Knope,You can't let him resign.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, I do."
Leslie Knope,I hope that's true.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, honey, how was your day?"
Leslie Knope,I can't believe you did that for me.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about that right now.
Leslie Knope,There was a piece of testimony that came out during the trial that I think you'd be interested in.
Leslie Knope,"Ethel? Ethel, could you please read page 132 of the official testimony?"
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ethel."
Leslie Knope,Can you please state your name for the committee?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,You can't even get your own name right.
Leslie Knope,Gary?
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,Your name is Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich? Jerry Gergich.
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich.
Leslie Knope,Jerry Gergich.
Leslie Knope,Gary Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry God, they're both horrible."
Leslie Knope,But Jerry's better.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna call you Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, do you remember a time"
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I can't get over the Gary/Jerry thing.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, come on, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Chris!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, is that a new jogging shirt?"
Leslie Knope,That's cool.
Leslie Knope,I totally understand that.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just going to, uh, take my flash drive and I'll do some work from home."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm not gonna do my job."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna oversee the department, and check in on the parks, and attend any meetings that require the deputy director."
Leslie Knope,Give me the nasal spray.
Leslie Knope,On three.
Leslie Knope,One Two Two Three.
Leslie Knope,It's so nice to be able to sit here in public and have breakfast with you.
Leslie Knope,"In a way, my suspension from work was kind of a blessing."
Leslie Knope,"Totally, the key is you have to keep yourself busy, or else you're gonna go crazy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at me, look how busy I am."
Leslie Knope,"I'm inventing a new spice called ""salgar."""
Leslie Knope,"It's part salt, part sugar."
Leslie Knope,Butterscotch pudding.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have to go to this meeting with my advisers."
Leslie Knope,"You have a big day, right?"
Leslie Knope,Which interview is this?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, sounds interesting."
Leslie Knope,"You might want to stop saying ""resigned in disgrace."""
Leslie Knope,Especially during job interviews.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, hi, hi, hi."
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,I was off getting holiday gifts for my team.
Leslie Knope,"William, here is a Knope 2012 tree ornament."
Leslie Knope,"And Elizabeth, I got you a Knope 2012 Menorah Maybe?"
Leslie Knope,"No, okay."
Leslie Knope,Then I got you a tree ornament.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's talk about damage control."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I could go on Pawnee Today, but and I know this is a long shot Oprah has her own network now."
Leslie Knope,"""Sit tight""?"
Leslie Knope,"""Take a beat""?"
Leslie Knope,"""Relax""?"
Leslie Knope,I don't really do any of those things.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, while I was in that meeting, I was also planning my mother's birthday party in my head."
Leslie Knope,Strawberry margaritas!
Leslie Knope,Another use for salgar!
Leslie Knope,Ben!
Leslie Knope,I'm going crazy!
Leslie Knope,"First, they won't let me work in the parks department, now they won't let me campaign either."
Leslie Knope,"All I want to do is improve our town, and they won't let me do that!"
Leslie Knope,This is just sugar.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need you to distract me."
Leslie Knope,Talk to me about something.
Leslie Knope,Anything.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Are you gonna take it?
Leslie Knope,You know what I think?
Leslie Knope,"If you don't love it, take a month."
Leslie Knope,See what else is out there.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I'll form a citizen action committee, I'll lobby from the outside, I'll harness the power of the community."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I finally have some work to do."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for dinner, honey."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Great turn out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, welcome everyone to the first meeting of the Parks Committee of Pawnee, or PCP."
Leslie Knope,"See, because Yes, because, like the drug PCP, we are so fast acting and powerful, we should be illegal."
Leslie Knope,"Now, what do you want to see fixed in the parks?"
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, II know for a fact that nobody in the parks department reads letters, except for one person, who is amazing, but she isn't currently there, because he was suspended."
Leslie Knope,"Pretty damn amazing, Diane."
Leslie Knope,Now shush.
Leslie Knope,"If we want to get the government off their bloated, bureaucratic butts, then we need our voices to be heard, and that's what we're gonna do."
Leslie Knope,"Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"No, no she's not."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I represent the PCP."
Leslie Knope,We have a list of six demands.
Leslie Knope,Here they are in alphabetical order.
Leslie Knope,Number one: Ants.
Leslie Knope,Too many ants in the teen center.
Leslie Knope,Number two: Tennis court improvements.
Leslie Knope,Number three
Leslie Knope,"Speaking of which, the fact that yahtzee is not in the rec center is a tragedy on par with human trafficking."
Leslie Knope,Slight exaggeration Getting back to our demands.
Leslie Knope,We will not be muzzled like a rabid dog.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take this all the way to the top.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have made some waves here, people, but we need to keep this momentum going."
Leslie Knope,"Now, the city manager's name is Chris Traeger."
Leslie Knope,I want to take this fight to him.
Leslie Knope,"God, Diane, will you stop it with the letterwriting campaign?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I have his office number.
Leslie Knope,I want one of you calling it every 15 minutes.
Leslie Knope,"We are also going to protest along his jogging route, and I need someone in every GNC within a fivemile radius of the city center."
Leslie Knope,But there are only 12 of us.
Leslie Knope,Look!
Leslie Knope,Our numbers are growing!
Leslie Knope,"There's nothing we can't do if we work hard, never sleep, and shirk all other responsibilities in our lives."
Leslie Knope,You with me?
Leslie Knope,Concerned citizen and community leader Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,"As a government employee, that's true, but I am just here as a concerned citizen and founder of PCP."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Committee of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We have many demands.
Leslie Knope,"Specifically, these six unfunded projects that need to be dealt with immediately."
Leslie Knope,Not good enough!
Leslie Knope,Prepare for battle.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I got your Christmas present."
Leslie Knope,It's like a little stopwatch that records your jogging times and then sends it to your computer via Bluetooth.
Leslie Knope,Aww.
Leslie Knope,My pleasure.
Leslie Knope,See you in hell!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is just a little militant citizen group I slapped together."
Leslie Knope,"But enough about me, what are my polling results?"
Leslie Knope,And we're at 15%?
Leslie Knope,We went back to 26%?
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."
Leslie Knope,50%?
Leslie Knope,One hundred?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That can't be right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, what we do is we move forward from this."
Leslie Knope,How do we put a positive spin on this?
Leslie Knope,Sure there is.
Leslie Knope,You're looking at the glass like it's 99% empty.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking at it like it's 1% full.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the last delicious sip of a milkshake at the bottom of the metal milkshakey thing?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like you're so pure and chaste."
Leslie Knope,"Please, I know the two of you are sleeping together."
Leslie Knope,"It's obvious, with all your glances and your sly smiles."
Leslie Knope,"Well, never mind then."
Leslie Knope,I can't.
Leslie Knope,I talked to everyone in the entire state who's ever run a campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Nobody wants a candidate who's polling at ""last milkshake sip"" levels."
Leslie Knope,One year you said one year.
Leslie Knope,That's on the record.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if I'm going to.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, I return to my old job in a week, and that's great because I love my old job, but My heart was really set on this new job."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Don't touch my pickles, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,You don't have to apologize.
Leslie Knope,You were very fair.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, I'm the one that needs to apologize."
Leslie Knope,I got you involved in PCP.
Leslie Knope,"But I'm starting a new group now, LSD, Leslie's Sorry Division, and I just want to say I'm sorry, Chris."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I'm pregnant."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? No, that's not it."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I think that's great.
Leslie Knope,I'm really proud of you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah? What are you gonna do instead?
Leslie Knope,I like it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, they're having a party in here."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you stay?
Leslie Knope,What's going on here?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I love it! Aw, I love it, and I love you guys, and Ann specifically."
Leslie Knope,And all of you! You did all of this together?
Leslie Knope,I don't understand.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, it's so much work."
Leslie Knope,I can't ask you to put your lives on hold.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to say Except Let's go win an election! Giving Christmas gifts is like a sport to me.
Leslie Knope,Finding or making that perfect something.
Leslie Knope,It's also like a sport to me because I always win.
Leslie Knope,"This year, though? My friends won."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, I got my ass handed to me."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, goody, you're all here."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know I'm not supposed to talk about my campaign in the office, but last night I've made a decision about who should be my campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,This is a huge job.
Leslie Knope,"This is going to require a lot of late night, oneonone jam sessions with me, and we're going to bounce ideas off of each other, you're going to have to take calls for me, any time, day or night."
Leslie Knope,"The person I have chosen is, drum roll please, Ann Perkins!"
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Give it up for Ann!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful tropical fish."
Leslie Knope,You're smart as a whip and you're cool under pressure.
Leslie Knope,You've resuscitated a human heart in your bare hands.
Leslie Knope,You haven't?
Leslie Knope,You will.
Leslie Knope,You're that good of a nurse.
Leslie Knope,Ben is poison in my campaign.
Leslie Knope,Our relationship is the reason why my advisors pulled out.
Leslie Knope,"I Ann, don't listen to your head or your heart."
Leslie Knope,"Just look at my eyes and say ""yes."""
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"I believe in you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,And your first job as my campaign manager is to start dressing like one.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to have this conversation again.
Leslie Knope,"William, Elizabeth."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,What are you Are you coming to see me?
Leslie Knope,Did you hear that I'm relaunching my campaign?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"So, my campaign ends and, just like that, you find someone else and run theirs?"
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Good luck, but, uh, I just had a big meeting with my new advisory board, and they're brilliant and amazing."
Leslie Knope,They're real killers.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Andy."
Leslie Knope,I'll be right in.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't need luck."
Leslie Knope,We are a rocket ship.
Leslie Knope,"We are relaunching, and we're going to blast past your cann Huh, they're gone."
Leslie Knope,"It's true I no longer have highly trained, professional campaign managers."
Leslie Knope,So what?
Leslie Knope,"Are most murders committed by highly trained, professional assassins?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,They're committed by friends and coworkers.
Leslie Knope,That analogy was way better in my head.
Leslie Knope,"""The Comeback Kid."""
Leslie Knope,"Robert Downey, Jr."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you're constructing the stage?"
Leslie Knope,You look like a real campaign manager.
Leslie Knope,"See, there's more things to look at on the Internet besides naked guys, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I need a team update, campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,I still can't believe that you got him.
Leslie Knope,Ann got local hero Pistol Pete Disellio to endorse me at the rally.
Leslie Knope,"In 1992, Pistol Pete's last second dunk against Eagleton High clinched a comeback victory for the Pawnee Central drunken savages."
Leslie Knope,Team mascot later changed.
Leslie Knope,"We can call you Pistol, right?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, got it."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,We overlapped a year at Pawnee Central.
Leslie Knope,You probably remember my voice from the morning announcements.
Leslie Knope,"This is my campaign manager, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,We're excited to have you.
Leslie Knope,Ann is killing it.
Leslie Knope,My campaign team is unstoppable.
Leslie Knope,This rally is going to be awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I'm feeling it!"
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna break dance!
Leslie Knope,Coming!
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you come out, and you dunk the ball, and you say, ""Voting for Leslie Knope is a slam dunk!"""
Leslie Knope,"You can still dunk, right?"
Leslie Knope,Sorry?
Leslie Knope,But the past is great.
Leslie Knope,"The jitterbug, stagecoaches, Herman Munster."
Leslie Knope,Let's not talk about dunking anymore.
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about what you want to do.
Leslie Knope,I think you want to dunk.
Leslie Knope,Let me talk to her.
Leslie Knope,"April, this is city council candidate Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Do not make any trouble.
Leslie Knope,Sit tight.
Leslie Knope,I'm on my way.
Leslie Knope,She'd already hung up on me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm going to go down there and get them out, because men in uniform love me."
Leslie Knope,You have to get Pistol Pete to make that shot.
Leslie Knope,He's our surprise headliner.
Leslie Knope,The whole town loves him.
Leslie Knope,I'm polling at 1%.
Leslie Knope,"He must dunk, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Do whatever it takes.
Leslie Knope,"You know, anything short of sexual favors."
Leslie Knope,"I do not I repeat, I do not want you to tempt him with sexual favors."
Leslie Knope,"Good, I wouldn't either."
Leslie Knope,That's where I draw the line.
Leslie Knope,"Although, I am a little offended that you wouldn't do that for me."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Glen, you're killing me."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice homecooked meal, and do what comes naturally."
Leslie Knope,You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team."
Leslie Knope,"I need them, please."
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,This is going to be fine.
Leslie Knope,"We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do."
Leslie Knope,"Answer your phone, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no word from Ann."
Leslie Knope,"April, I need a status report."
Leslie Knope,How's it looking out there?
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?"
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What happened?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how's the stage coming?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face?"
Leslie Knope,"Good, where is he?"
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Is he going to dunk for me?
Leslie Knope,He's crying?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"We should cancel it, right?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should cancel it?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Jerry You were in charge of getting a crowd.
Leslie Knope,"Please tell me that you pulled a Jerry, and no one's here."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you?"
Leslie Knope,"I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, everybody listen up."
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to say thank you.
Leslie Knope,"You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm going to go out there, and I'm going to announce the relaunch, and I'm going to muddle through this thing as best I can."
Leslie Knope,"You should all leave, and when this thing is over, I'll meet you at the nearest bar."
Leslie Knope,Let's give this crowd a show.
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Everybody smile and wave.
Leslie Knope,Ron? Ron? There's no stairs.
Leslie Knope,How do I get onto the stage? Okay.
Leslie Knope,Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Mm-mm.
Leslie Knope,"As a loyal pawneean, I've always been proud of this town, and, I, oh, um, sorry."
Leslie Knope,My cards got out of order here when they fell.
Leslie Knope,"Together, we can defeat obese children."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure that was something positive, originally."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, okay, this is just a disaster, isn't it? This is the worst political event ever in history."
Leslie Knope,"Well, um, I can assure you people in the bleachers that, if you follow my campaign, it will be interesting."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Pistol Pete!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, we're so happy to have you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,There he goes.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Pete! Oh!"
Leslie Knope,"Pistol Pete, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Still got it.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"No, we didn't."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, my campaign manager and I have made a decision."
Leslie Knope,And hire you.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if you're poison to my campaign.
Leslie Knope,This team has a lot of heart and zero know-how.
Leslie Knope,You're the only one that can save us.
Leslie Knope,Please be my campaign manager.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're fired."
Leslie Knope,"So, cookies."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann, yes."
Leslie Knope,You should do that.
Leslie Knope,You're not married.
Leslie Knope,She's not married.
Leslie Knope,"Bobby Newport, heir to the sweetums candy fortune."
Leslie Knope,"He just entered the race, and he's already 70 points up in all the polls."
Leslie Knope,He is attractive and charming.
Leslie Knope,"And his family employs half the town, but so what?"
Leslie Knope,I am a lifelong government bureaucrat who's wellversed in the issues.
Leslie Knope,And those are the kind of sexy qualifications that win elections.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Mr."
Leslie Knope,"Newport, we meet at last."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Leslie's fine.
Leslie Knope,"No, you're not running unopposed."
Leslie Knope,You've very opposed by me.
Leslie Knope,We just told you.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna be running for city council.
Leslie Knope,I think we scared him.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we have to find a way to beat him."
Leslie Knope,And luckily Ben is going to announce the most amazing campaign strategy ever thought of in the entire history of western democracy.
Leslie Knope,"Go, Ben, here's your great idea."
Leslie Knope,We're all ready for it.
Leslie Knope,And start.
Leslie Knope,I'm running for office.
Leslie Knope,I'm surrounded by my friends.
Leslie Knope,My campaign manager and I are in love.
Leslie Knope,This is exactly how I dreamed it would be when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,Except I wasn't and my campaign manager was Mr. Belvedere
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we'll write an inspiring oped piece."
Leslie Knope,"Yay, it's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, um, between you and me, I think that Donna is having a problem with going negative in the ad."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Donna."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I didn't want to tell you this, but Ann is having a hard time with it."
Leslie Knope,She's kind of freaking out right now.
Leslie Knope,It's who
Leslie Knope,Do you like it?
Leslie Knope,"I hate negative ads, and I would never do one in a million years."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to run an ad that highlights the good things about me, not the bad things about somebody else."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you are our communications director."
Leslie Knope,Weigh in here.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'll pick Ann and Donna for my team."
Leslie Knope,You can take Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you wanted to go negative."
Leslie Knope,"You got the biggest negative in the world, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Okay everybody I need big smiles from you We're making a positive ad here.
Leslie Knope,So just think of this as Christmas and your birthday and the first day of school all rolled up into one.
Leslie Knope,Positive is always better than negative.
Leslie Knope,"Barack Obama said, ""yes we can,"" and now he's president."
Leslie Knope,"Ben says, ""no we shouldn't,"" and now he's working for his girlfriend."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I need double the smiles, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's take it back again.
Leslie Knope,And action.
Leslie Knope,And this is going great.
Leslie Knope,We're really positive.
Leslie Knope,"I think we're getting good stuff, right?"
Leslie Knope,What's it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,Do you think?
Leslie Knope,"What is this guy running for, president of being on every channel all the time?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're beautiful and you're organized."
Leslie Knope,"So in order not to bias anyone, these are the two ads that Ben and I made."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna pick one randomly, and we'll play that one first."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yay, the awesome one."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"I'm pro parks, pro public safety, and I'm pro clean water."
Leslie Knope,"I'm also pro environmental regulation, and I'm very, very pro local propositions 45, 86, and 102F. But most of all, I'm pro Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Here are some other things that I'm pro.
Leslie Knope,"As you can see, I'm in favor of a lot of things, like hot dogs."
Leslie Knope,"Right, Charlie?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, and I approve this message."
Leslie Knope,Do we even want to screen yours?
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,Name one thing that was wrong with it.
Leslie Knope,I did it's implied.
Leslie Knope,I didn't we can just put it in.
Leslie Knope,It's mean.
Leslie Knope,It's depressing.
Leslie Knope,It's awful.
Leslie Knope,"""I am Ben Wyatt, and I want to destroy Leslie's dreams."""
Leslie Knope,Now I think it is time for us to take a vote.
Leslie Knope,So who's in favor of Ben's ad?
Leslie Knope,Traitors!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, I painted your garage pink."
Leslie Knope,Our friendship is over.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,It's not over.
Leslie Knope,It's never over.
Leslie Knope,Bff.
Leslie Knope,I love you forever.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, it seems like we're kind of evenly split."
Leslie Knope,I think we should keep debating.
Leslie Knope,But I This is just it's just not the way I dreamed it would be.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to air a negative ad.
Leslie Knope,It's out of my hands now.
Leslie Knope,"But you know what, I'm actually feeling very zen about this."
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, and I do not approve this message."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I'm really sorry I tackled you.
Leslie Knope,"It's just, I'd rather run the fake campaign ads that I made when I was ten than become negative and cynical."
Leslie Knope,You need to get tougher.
Leslie Knope,You were pretty easy to take down.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,I love Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And I want to make it even better.
Leslie Knope,"Better schools, safer streets, and a more progressive tax on residential properties."
Leslie Knope,I like dogs.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we already have a thousand views."
Leslie Knope,I don't care.
Leslie Knope,I'm proud of it.
Leslie Knope,"It is accurate about my opponent, it does not take"
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Newport, hello."
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt.
Leslie Knope,I'll take a milkshake.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're good."
Leslie Knope,What can we do for you?
Leslie Knope,"Well, we used your own ad, so I don't think it was mean."
Leslie Knope,Stop running the ad?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna quit the campaign.
Leslie Knope,Why would we do that?
Leslie Knope,Bobby.
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question? Why are you even running for office?
Leslie Knope,I'm running for office because I want to improve the lives of the people that I love and the city that's the greatest city in the world.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not going anywhere, and we are gonna debate soon, and I need to warn you, I know my stuff."
Leslie Knope,So you should toughen up.
Leslie Knope,That girl is me as a ten-year-old.
Leslie Knope,I will institute a reduction in taxes For the small business owner as well as a 7% surcharge on all nonlocal business related development.
Leslie Knope,Together we will build a better pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Well, my campaign has a little momentum, so we're trying to capitalize on that by doing a focus group."
Leslie Knope,Some things are very helpful.
Leslie Knope,Other things are not so helpful.
Leslie Knope,All the things make me feel a lot of feelings about myself.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,I am excellent at bowling.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,You're totally right.
Leslie Knope,I'm not obsessing.
Leslie Knope,I'm just reminding myself to tell Ron to tell you how good I am at bowling.
Leslie Knope,"Mm, yeah, that's really interesting stuff."
Leslie Knope,Why did that guy say that he wouldn't want to go bowling with me?
Leslie Knope,I've never been very good at letting things go.
Leslie Knope,I can't tell you how many times a fun tugofwar with a dog over a chew toy turned contentious.
Leslie Knope,One of us always ends up mad.
Leslie Knope,"I did some research too about the guy who said the thing about me and bowling, and his name is Derek."
Leslie Knope,And get this he's not even that good of a bowler.
Leslie Knope,"His average is 132, according to the most recent available data."
Leslie Knope,which I am.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,That is so sexist.
Leslie Knope,It's just because I'm a woman.
Leslie Knope,"Would they deign to say such things to Woodrow Wilson or Benjamin Disraeli okay, I see what you're talking about."
Leslie Knope,"Well, then maybe the campaign should host a bowling night."
Leslie Knope,It would be laidback.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone having fun, great photo op."
Leslie Knope,Also I'm really good at bowling.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,You're kidding.
Leslie Knope,Do I look laidback?
Leslie Knope,How about now?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I forget now.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks for coming, man."
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thanks, rich."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, here."
Leslie Knope,Smile.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you'll get your picture the pawnee journal.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you know, I feel very, you know, casual, relaxed."
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I wouldn't know."
Leslie Knope,I'm never on the other side of the glass with those things.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Leslie Knope,I'm thinking about the big picture.
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to make the picture bigger by including this guy in it.
Leslie Knope,"I can't do anything about my gender or my height, but I can win that guy over with a fun round of bowling."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hear you."
Leslie Knope,I'll treat him just like everybody else.
Leslie Knope,"I'll just say hi to him, shake his hand, buy a him a few beers, share a few laughs, bowl a few frames, lose intentionally to make him feel good, friend him on Facebook."
Leslie Knope,"And by the end of the night, he will be mine."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, ""thar"" she bowls."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,You wanna bowl?
Leslie Knope,You wanna bowl together?
Leslie Knope,"You wanna be, like, bowl buddies?"
Leslie Knope,"Great, just a casual game, you know?"
Leslie Knope,No biggie.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just I'm just being cas."
Leslie Knope,What are you rocking?
Leslie Knope,A 15 pounder?
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, hey, good for you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there they are."
Leslie Knope,I just ordered some wings for us.
Leslie Knope,You like wings?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Who knew?
Leslie Knope,I knew.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"That's how I motivate myself, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Never good enough.
Leslie Knope,Let me get you a beer.
Leslie Knope,These beers are as cold as the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, dude."
Leslie Knope,It's my guilty pleasure.
Leslie Knope,Yeehaw!
Leslie Knope,"Man, move over, pins."
Leslie Knope,There's a new Sheriff in town.
Leslie Knope,"You are so down with strikes, they should call you Norma Rae."
Leslie Knope,It's a Sally Field movie about Unions.
Leslie Knope,Doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, you're really good at this."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, classic Derek with the Zings."
Leslie Knope,"Man, that's what bowling is all about hey."
Leslie Knope,It's going really good.
Leslie Knope,"Um, we're just hanging out and having a very good time."
Leslie Knope,"I realize that, but I will knock down this pin, and then this pin will knock down all the other pins."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Classic Derek.
Leslie Knope,"Well, congratulations, man."
Leslie Knope,"Fun match, fun game, good times."
Leslie Knope,Did you have fun?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, just one second."
Leslie Knope,"I'm running for city council, as you know, and uh, just wondering, do I have your vote?"
Leslie Knope,Derek.
Leslie Knope,You old soandso.
Leslie Knope,"For reals, can I count on your vote?"
Leslie Knope,"But we've been here bowling all night, and we've been having fun."
Leslie Knope,And you're still not gonna vote for me?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're a crappy bowler, and I pretended to lose to you."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's true."
Leslie Knope,I am a really good bowler.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I'd love to.
Leslie Knope,"Tell you what, if I win, I get your vote."
Leslie Knope,Done.
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I'd like to introduce Derek's ass to my foot.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you got a spare."
Leslie Knope,That's so cute.
Leslie Knope,Check out the scoreboard.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Derek."
Leslie Knope,"What a defeat, man."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I did not expect to win by that much."
Leslie Knope,"But I warned you, I am a good bowler."
Leslie Knope,"All joking aside, I wanna say that I actually had fun."
Leslie Knope,And I'm really looking forward to your vote in the spring.
Leslie Knope,Just ignore him.
Leslie Knope,He's being a jerk.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That was awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look."
Leslie Knope,Here's that photo op you wanted.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Just take a few deep breaths, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, Randy, I would like you to know that we will not be pressing charges."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, the guy was being a total jerk."
Leslie Knope,"What Ben did was warranted and extremely awesome, by the way."
Leslie Knope,Did you write down how awesome it was?
Leslie Knope,"Well, the headline I would've gone with is ""no-strike-bowling bowler struck by Knope's striking beau."
Leslie Knope,Nonstarter.
Leslie Knope,Not today.
Leslie Knope,I don't deserve it.
Leslie Knope,I got us into this mess because I was fixating on that guy.
Leslie Knope,But this is ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,I do need more whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,Ma'am.
Leslie Knope,I'd like to first start by saying thank you for coming.
Leslie Knope,"And on behalf of Ben Wyatt and everyone involved in my campaign, I'm very sorry for what happened at the rock n' roll bowling alley last night."
Leslie Knope,"You know what? No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sorry.
Leslie Knope,"This guy was drunk, and he was aggressive."
Leslie Knope,"And he was rude, and he was foulmouthed."
Leslie Knope,"And he called me by my second least favorite term for a woman, and my campaign manager punched him."
Leslie Knope,"I do not condone violence, but I have to be honest, it was awesome."
Leslie Knope,And my campaign manager and I made out a lot afterward.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, I probably shouldn't have said that."
Leslie Knope,But that's what happened.
Leslie Knope,"Derek hates me, and I don't particularly like him."
Leslie Knope,"So what's the point, right, Derek?"
Leslie Knope,See? So I'm not going to apologize.
Leslie Knope,"And if people won't vote for me because of that, well, there's nothing I can do about it."
Leslie Knope,But you should be warned.
Leslie Knope,"If you do not vote for me, my boyfriend might beat you up."
Leslie Knope,"Now if anyone has any questions about the issues facing our city, I'm right here."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that guy said he didn't like my earrings."
Leslie Knope,Go punch him.
Leslie Knope,This is very exciting.
Leslie Knope,"We are at Saint Joseph's Medical Center because, today, Andy Dwyer is getting his casts off."
Leslie Knope,"It is a great day for Andy, and it's a wonderful day for my subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"No, they're not."
Leslie Knope,"Doctor, if I may, could I keep that cast, please?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"This is a symbol of new beginnings, a symbol of hope, and of our project."
Leslie Knope,We will build this park!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, everyone!"
Leslie Knope,Ann wants to say something.
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"So, I would love to come to this thing."
Leslie Knope,When is it?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Tonight?
Leslie Knope,I can't go.
Leslie Knope,My mom set up this meeting.
Leslie Knope,It's like a political tete-a-tete with a local bigwig.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you guys."
Leslie Knope,You know how I love mixing work into my personal life.
Leslie Knope,"This guy is important, and he has valuable information that could help us build a park."
Leslie Knope,But I wanna go to the concert!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I wanna go to that concert so bad, but I have to go to the meeting."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,"But I'll meet up with you guys after the tete-a-tete, I promise."
Leslie Knope,"Now, you know that we're gonna be building a park on a residential lot, so, of course we're gonna have to get the zoning codes approved and amended by our city council."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Uh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, documentaries, political thrillers."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"So, I brought some pictures of the lot, and you can tell that the houses are very close to it."
Leslie Knope,How difficult is rezoning in your town?
Leslie Knope,Could you go into detail a little bit about that?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you have to have zoning codes, or else the whole thing could be chaos."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I've been focusing on my career.
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?
Leslie Knope,Uh
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Mom."
Leslie Knope,He thinks we're on a date.
Leslie Knope,Did you tell him we were on a date?
Leslie Knope,"Well, neither is he."
Leslie Knope,And he's 62 years old.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, how are you?"
Leslie Knope,Terrific.
Leslie Knope,"So, did you give any more thought to those zoning code questions I asked you?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's a great place for a business meeting.
Leslie Knope,You already asked me that.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"My friend Andy is playing in a band tonight, and I kind of wanted to go."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Are you sure?
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,They're my favorite rock group.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I missed it?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,He's my date.
Leslie Knope,George Gernway.
Leslie Knope,He's the City Manager in Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, band!"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry that I missed your songs.
Leslie Knope,Is there any way that you guys could do like an encore or something?
Leslie Knope,"No, don't leave."
Leslie Knope,I just got here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,George.
Leslie Knope,George!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It was nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,Home.
Leslie Knope,It's been a really crappy night.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe my mom tried to set me up with an 80 year old man.
Leslie Knope,I went to dinner tonight with somebody's grandpa.
Leslie Knope,Hey! Congratulations are in order.
Leslie Knope,I heard that you got that speed bump thing through.
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about? That thing was a pain in the butt.
Leslie Knope,You fixed a problem.
Leslie Knope,That's what we're supposed to do.
Leslie Knope,Mark and I are really connecting tonight.
Leslie Knope,Like we connected that night when we made love five years ago.
Leslie Knope,There's actually a lot of similarities between those two nights.
Leslie Knope,That time we were also at a bar.
Leslie Knope,And he was also pretty drunk.
Leslie Knope,"If you could put anything in the park, what would you put in there?"
Leslie Knope,Don't over-think it.
Leslie Knope,A picnic table?
Leslie Knope,"God, that sounds wonderful."
Leslie Knope,I would live in that park.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,What time is it? I should go.
Leslie Knope,Where are we going? All the bars are closed.
Leslie Knope,"What? Mark, don't."
Leslie Knope,This pit isn't a dump.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so"
Leslie Knope,So far to the left! So far to the left!
Leslie Knope,"No, please."
Leslie Knope,I don't want anyone to see! I'm the Deputy Director of Parks
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this pit."
Leslie Knope,Give it to me straight.
Leslie Knope,Are we ever gonna turn it into a park?
Leslie Knope,"But, seriously, I mean, really?"
Leslie Knope,Screw it.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna try to do it anyway.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, Kennedy put a man on the moon."
Leslie Knope,I can build one park.
Leslie Knope,I really admire you.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what am I doing?"
Leslie Knope,This isn't the way I want this to happen again.
Leslie Knope,"I think you should go home, Mark."
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, it's"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Mark, are you all right?"
Leslie Knope,"Are you okay? Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, time for gifts."
Leslie Knope,"We have gift certificates for facials everybody, then you're gonna get a needlepoint pillow with your face on it and a news headline from a newspaper on the day you were born."
Leslie Knope,"That's right, Mom, and you replaced him."
Leslie Knope,Though not in terms of genocide.
Leslie Knope,"Just in terms of, you know, being on earth."
Leslie Knope,"February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance, but February 13th, galentine's day, is about celebrating lady friends."
Leslie Knope,"It's wonderful, and it should be a national holiday."
Leslie Knope,It should be a national holiday.
Leslie Knope,"Dear Congress, it's Leslie again."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about personal relationships.
Leslie Knope,Who wants to start?
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,"April, you're the old married broad here."
Leslie Knope,How's Andy?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"And mom, how's it going with Steven?"
Leslie Knope,"La, la, la, la, la, la, la."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, can you start talking?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I put you on the spot when I asked you about your love life."
Leslie Knope,How are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you beautiful spinster."
Leslie Knope,I will find you love.
Leslie Knope,Love you.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Great attitude, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so the Valentine's Day dance is planned, prepped, and under budget, but we have one final task."
Leslie Knope,"Ann Perkins is currently attending the Valentine's Day dance alone, so I need each one of you to bring an eligible bachelor for her tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Because that's what friends do, April."
Leslie Knope,They help friends find happiness.
Leslie Knope,"Now the last guy she liked was Chris, but she can't date him again because he's her boss."
Leslie Knope,"So when we're thinking of prospective sweethearts, we need to think of people who are Attractive and smart and kind."
Leslie Knope,"And if you're wondering what kind of guy is right for Ann, all you need to do is ask."
Leslie Knope,"Also you need to find someone educated, and friendly, and fun"
Leslie Knope,"Effervescent, he needs to be effervescent."
Leslie Knope,No one respond.
Leslie Knope,No one say anything.
Leslie Knope,Silence.
Leslie Knope,Yachter Otter?
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Two months ago, I have a dream about a playboy otter lost at sea, and you make him real?"
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,I thought we had agreed that we weren't gonna get each other presents because we were too busy with the campaign I got you something too.
Leslie Knope,"It is a cryptex, like in that movie The Da Vinci Code, which was the first movie that you and I ever watched on Starz HD."
Leslie Knope,Inside it will tell you where to meet me at 9:00 P.M.
Leslie Knope,"tonight, and the combination is a fiveletter code that captures the essence of our third date."
Leslie Knope,Yeah So I will see you tonight.
Leslie Knope,Unless You can't crack the code.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, well done."
Leslie Knope,Please get your gigolo out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you're here."
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,You brought Orin?
Leslie Knope,"Ann is not some weird, morose mummy."
Leslie Knope,"Offense intended, Orin."
Leslie Knope,Let this be a wakeup call about the way you present yourself to the world.
Leslie Knope,I ask you to do one thing.
Leslie Knope,Do you know how hard I've been working to try to pull this together before Ann gets here?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you're here."
Leslie Knope,We weren't talking about you.
Leslie Knope,How are you?
Leslie Knope,"What about a wedding where you used to go out with the groom, and you're the only one there without a date, so the bride makes you dance to Single Ladies by yourself?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"Let's get a drink, and then you and I are gonna have some fun."
Leslie Knope,"There was supposed to be, like, 20 guys here for Ann, and there's only four."
Leslie Knope,Who else do we have?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, taken."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, taken."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"My dentist Is 80, and he's gay, and he's taken."
Leslie Knope,Uh what's this?
Leslie Knope,P. Hut
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Pizza Hut!"
Leslie Knope,"Hold on Hi, how cute are you?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, this is my lawyer friend, Alex."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Alex gives my campaign legal advice, and Ann is the greatest human being ever invented."
Leslie Knope,So I'm gonna what?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, someone needs me."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go, and you two just hit it off now."
Leslie Knope,You crazy kids.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, looks like you already met Jeff."
Leslie Knope,"No, Jeff."
Leslie Knope,How am I supposed to find the love of Ann's life when it sounds like a funeral in here?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go talk to Chris.
Leslie Knope,You go help Ann.
Leslie Knope,"She's not responding to my top candidates, so we're gonna have to go with some wild cards."
Leslie Knope,And April Thanks for nothing.
Leslie Knope,Why should I do anything to help her?
Leslie Knope,"Because despite the fact that all you do is give her a hard time, she would do this for you."
Leslie Knope,Just go hide under the table with your friend Orin.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I see you, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Chris, what do you think about changing the music?"
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,You should look on the bright side.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure that Millicent couldn't keep up with you on your runs, so now you can go full speed again."
Leslie Knope,"No, your best is still ahead of you."
Leslie Knope,You don't look a day over 30.
Leslie Knope,Who says that?
Leslie Knope,There are a lot of soul mates in the world.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at Ann."
Leslie Knope,"You dated her, and she's a perfect human specimen, and you tossed her out like day old chowder."
Leslie Knope,But it's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,Buck up.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,How is your evening unfolding in terms of your conversations with men?
Leslie Knope,How lucky that that happened to you on Valentine's Day.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Stay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, can you just do me a favor and give me your car keys for a second?"
Leslie Knope,There's something I need to look at on your car keys.
Leslie Knope,You know me too well.
Leslie Knope,"It sucks being alone on Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna take Ann out for a drink, you know."
Leslie Knope,Try to cheer her up.
Leslie Knope,And I can be late meeting Ben.
Leslie Knope,"He's not gonna be on time, 'cause those clues are hard."
Leslie Knope,"They're really, really hard, and I'm really worried that he's not gonna be able to figure it out."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky bastard."
Leslie Knope,Look at Ann.
Leslie Knope,She's putting on makeup.
Leslie Knope,She using the emergency mini curling iron that I gave her.
Leslie Knope,She has a date.
Leslie Knope,Why wouldn't she tell me who it is?
Leslie Knope,Because she doesn't want me to know.
Leslie Knope,Because it's someone she shouldn't be dating.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, the music's better."
Leslie Knope,Have you seen Chris?
Leslie Knope,She's going to meet Chris.
Leslie Knope,"What do you want, April?"
Leslie Knope,"After all the hoops that Ben and I had to jump through because of the boss employee thing, it is absolutely my business."
Leslie Knope,"Chris needs to explain himself, and Ann lied to me about this date."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, so many injustices."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,I will let it go for now.
Leslie Knope,"But I want you to know that I think there is some Okay, she hung up on me."
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,"At first you did not understand what made this tiny horse so special, and now you love him more than I do."
Leslie Knope,I really tried to make that hard.
Leslie Knope,I'm very impressed with you.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but I have to tell you something."
Leslie Knope,Chris and Ann are on a secret date.
Leslie Knope,"Which is crazy because he's her boss, which is the exact situation we were in, except we were put on trial for it."
Leslie Knope,"And I know I'm not supposed to care, and I'm supposed to let it go, and we should just have a romantic dinner"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"God, I love you so much."
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to see the look on Chris' remarkably youthful face when we march in there and confront him
Leslie Knope,Ahh! Shh.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,Tom and Ann are on a date.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean you know? How do you know?
Leslie Knope,You know what I'm hearing? You tried to make Ann happy for Valentine's Day.
Leslie Knope,You're a very nice person.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are."
Leslie Knope,Very nice person.
Leslie Knope,I do not understand this.
Leslie Knope,This really confuses me.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I love passionate speakers and Italian men."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't mean I love Mussolini.
Leslie Knope,Not as much as Irish Scottish? White whatever you are.
Leslie Knope,This is the weirdest Valentine's Day ever.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,"No parties, you hate parties."
Leslie Knope,The scavenger hunt?
Leslie Knope,"Yep, I understand."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I got it, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Chief Trumple, nice to see you."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee's police chief is retiring, and I'm trying to get his endorsement before he goes."
Leslie Knope,I'm really nervous because I need this for my campaign.
Leslie Knope,And Ben is really nervous because he is afraid of cops.
Leslie Knope,"I understand you need to think about it, but if you were going to make a decision"
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,Don't.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,And we're walking.
Leslie Knope,You could not keep it together in there.
Leslie Knope,Dave.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You look great.
Leslie Knope,"So what are you oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Um, Ben, this, uh this is my this is Dave Sanderson."
Leslie Knope,Are you here for a while?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, we're going to that, too, actually, but we're gonna go a little later, because first, we're going to have dinner at a really nice new French restaurant."
Leslie Knope,You should come to dinner with us.
Leslie Knope,I shouldn't have invited him.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"No, look, he's here for one night."
Leslie Knope,"He's a really great guy, and he's gonna love you, which bonus will make all the other cops love you."
Leslie Knope,"Dave is a great person, and he's a great judge of character."
Leslie Knope,"Tonight he's going to endorse Ben, and Trumple is going to endorse me."
Leslie Knope,Double endorsement.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, that sounds like an Ashley Judd movie."
Leslie Knope,Ben's doing an amazing job as campaign manager.
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,He's really smart.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So, how is San Diego"
Leslie Knope,What did you just say?
Leslie Knope,Did you just say you were still in love with me?
Leslie Knope,"Dave, why would you tell me that here and now?"
Leslie Knope,"No, you cannot bring this up at all when my boyfriend is here."
Leslie Knope,"No, bad call."
Leslie Knope,That's not the call.
Leslie Knope,"No, listen to me."
Leslie Knope,So you're leaving tomorrow?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it was so good to see you."
Leslie Knope,"How's that, now?"
Leslie Knope,You don't have to.
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of good candidates.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,We have caught up.
Leslie Knope,We talked about San Diego and about the six bad guys.
Leslie Knope,I think we're good.
Leslie Knope,Take your time.
Leslie Knope,He said he's still in love with me.
Leslie Knope,"While you were in the bathroom, he said he was still in love with me."
Leslie Knope,Can you just not freak out?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Here's my credit card quick, now."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, dessert's overrated and gross."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, thank you so much for a lovely evening."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'd like to talk to Ben, and then I'd like the three of us to talk together."
Leslie Knope,So who's talking now?
Leslie Knope,Where's Ben?
Leslie Knope,He left?
Leslie Knope,He said that?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, what?"
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,What were you thinking?
Leslie Knope,"Can you just uncuff him, please?"
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to say, ""I told you so,"" but"
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"He was a very important person to me, and it mattered to me that he liked you, which is silly."
Leslie Knope,Let's just go home.
Leslie Knope,"No, let's not go there."
Leslie Knope,"I don't care about the endorsement, and I don't want to put you through this any more."
Leslie Knope,"So, if you move here, I hope we can be friends, but I love Ben."
Leslie Knope,"He comes first, and if you're going to act like an ass, I can't talk to you, ever."
Leslie Knope,"Shrimpy or not He's smart, and he's cute, and he's kind, and he's funny, and he's got a great face and nice hair, and he's"
Leslie Knope,I'm very happy.
Leslie Knope,And he's not shrimpy.
Leslie Knope,"A few weeks ago, a guy called me a bitch in a bowling alley, and he punched him in the face."
Leslie Knope,"Trumple gave me the endorsement, which is great, but really, the only endorsement that matters is Ben's, and I locked that sucker up a long time ago."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about endorse ten beers into my mouth, 'cause this has been an incredibly stressful evening."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you beautiful, rulebreaking moth."
Leslie Knope,You know we can't talk about my campaign in here.
Leslie Knope,"When you're running for office, there are, like, a million rules of what you can and cannot do."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And because I work for the government, I am not allowed to do anything campaign related inside a government building."
Leslie Knope,Outside.
Leslie Knope,It's kind of a pain in the ass.
Leslie Knope,But it's great exercise But it's a pain in the ass.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"I did not finish it, but I will finish it."
Leslie Knope,"So wait, what was your question again?"
Leslie Knope,"No, April, I need to keep my work separate, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just think of it like a fun game.
Leslie Knope,Parks is inside.
Leslie Knope,Campaign is outside.
Leslie Knope,Parks is inside.
Leslie Knope,Campaign's outside.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, that is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,"No, you've talked about it, and I've ignored it, because it is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,"Need I remind you that even if I win the election, I can still work at the Parks department."
Leslie Knope,City council is a parttime job.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have time to spare."
Leslie Knope,"I'm also volunteering at ""Wheels For Meals On Wheels."
Leslie Knope,""" We repair vans for ""Meals On Wheels."""
Leslie Knope,Or I own four identical versions of the same sweater.
Leslie Knope,"That's the style now, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""lollipopping."""
Leslie Knope,All the kids are doing it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"I accept your apology, I will not take a sabbatical, as we agreed, and we will never discuss this again."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I forgot your birthday.
Leslie Knope,This is unacceptable.
Leslie Knope,Birthdays are important.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry we forgot yours.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I guess it did."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, Happy Birthday to Jerry."
Leslie Knope,You are a kind and wonderful soul.
Leslie Knope,Also I need you to do some fecal contamination testing at the reservoir.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, go get a kit from maintenance, and I need you to check the water for bird dung."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, what are you doing standing here?"
Leslie Knope,Our water has poop in it.
Leslie Knope,Now Jerry is turning 64 this year.
Leslie Knope,64 divided by 4 is 16.
Leslie Knope,So we're gonna throw him a Sweet 16 surprise party.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be very special.
Leslie Knope,"No, April, the unusual."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, no fish."
Leslie Knope,Jerry only gets a real birthday every four years.
Leslie Knope,"And four years from now, who knows?"
Leslie Knope,He might be retired Or dead.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Mm, no."
Leslie Knope,"The campaign can wait, 'cause this is official Parks business."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, can we use your lake house?"
Leslie Knope,Can we use your house?
Leslie Knope,Not only more jobs but better jobs.
Leslie Knope,I just did a phone interview while simultaneously decorating this house for Jerry's surprise party.
Leslie Knope,"Totally multitasking, totally on top of all of it."
Leslie Knope,"Crow for dinner tonight, Mr."
Leslie Knope,Swanson?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are locked and loaded."
Leslie Knope,Music is ready.
Leslie Knope,Slideshow is prepped.
Leslie Knope,"April, when does Jerry arrive?"
Leslie Knope,Who was supposed to invite Jerry?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, someone was supposed to invite Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"It's his surp Crap, it was me."
Leslie Knope,I forgot to invite Jerry.
Leslie Knope,I'm not taking a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,Is this because I forgot to invite Jerry to his own birthday party?
Leslie Knope,"I have a prediction, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"By the end of the night, you are going to take a bite of Jerry's cake, which incidentally, we need to pick up on the way home, and you are gonna say, ""sabbatical, schmabbatical."
Leslie Knope,Leslie can do it all.
Leslie Knope,"She's the best, and I'm stupid."
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Where the hell could he be?
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, why did you call us in here?"
Leslie Knope,"There is a Parks emergency that only you can help us solve, so we need you to get out of the tub."
Leslie Knope,Let's get going.
Leslie Knope,"No, there's no time."
Leslie Knope,Crap on a catapult.
Leslie Knope,They screwed up my campaign signs.
Leslie Knope,Now I gotta deal with this.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I will, Ron."
Leslie Knope,And I shall do it with aplomb.
Leslie Knope,"So as you can imagine, we would never have ordered a sign with all this complicated nonsense because, you know, we're not insane."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I can read the sign.
Leslie Knope,It does.
Leslie Knope,You don't need to read the whole thing.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,it does say that.
Leslie Knope,""" Jpeg."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Walter, it does say that."
Leslie Knope,"You're right, but using basic logic and human intelligence, one can surmise that this is a link to an image."
Leslie Knope,This isn't what we wanted printed on the signs.
Leslie Knope,Can I just show you something here?
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here, look."
Leslie Knope,"No, I got it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we did everything, Ron."
Leslie Knope,We got new signs.
Leslie Knope,We put them in people's yards.
Leslie Knope,We got Jerry for the surprise sinkhole emergency.
Leslie Knope,"And, uh, we briefly ran out of gas, and then we walked to the gas station."
Leslie Knope,"We got more gas, and now we're all good."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you should've thought about that before we dragged you out of the bath, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, as soon as we open this door, everything will become clear."
Leslie Knope,Surprise!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, what the [Bleep]?"
Leslie Knope,Where the hell is everybody?
Leslie Knope,Wake everybody up.
Leslie Knope,"No, I am not gonna let this fall apart."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna throw Jerry an amazing Sweet 16 surprise party no matter how agonizing it is for all of us.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I want everyone to go around and tell their favorite Jerry story."
Leslie Knope,A positive one.
Leslie Knope,Who's first?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Donna?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Surprise! Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"What happened? Well, you slept with Jerry last night."
Leslie Knope,"No, I was planning Jerry's morning surprise party."
Leslie Knope,Morning surprise parties are always the best.
Leslie Knope,Let's get going.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,How old were you?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Which I do.
Leslie Knope,I will cut back to 10 hours a week.
Leslie Knope,15
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted to say I'm sorry that I screwed up your birthday party."
Leslie Knope,But we all pitched in.
Leslie Knope,And we are sending you and Gayle to a B&B in your favorite place in the world.
Leslie Knope,"Amazingly, yes."
Leslie Knope,"Muncie, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, campaign."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,This is Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"So apparently, Newport just fired his campaign manager because Ben was kicking his ass."
Leslie Knope,Ben is the best campaign manager anyone could ever have.
Leslie Knope,Every move he's made has worked.
Leslie Knope,"He's like a brilliant, sexy, little hummingbird."
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Keep up the good work.
Leslie Knope,You're doing great.
Leslie Knope,"And to get the gray vote, you need to get the endorsement of Ned Jones."
Leslie Knope,He's the president of Pawnee Seniors United.
Leslie Knope,He's like The Godfather but old.
Leslie Knope,"The ""grond"" father, he's like It doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"He's important, and he's old."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Jones, such a pleasure to meet you."
Leslie Knope,Please don't get up.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Three words: Ramp Up Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is way behind the times in terms of making its buildings wheelchair accessible.
Leslie Knope,"Not enough ramps is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors Right behind ""everything hurts"" and ""I'm dying."""
Leslie Knope,"Like I always say, stairs are a young man's game."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, who?"
Leslie Knope,Oh my God Newport hired a real Washington hotshot.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and check out this picture."
Leslie Knope,She's eating egg salad with Colin Powell.
Leslie Knope,That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen.
Leslie Knope,Why are you smiling?
Leslie Knope,Why is this terrifying information making you smile?
Leslie Knope,So what do we do next?
Leslie Knope,"As a candidate, I appreciate your strategic mind, but as woman, all I care about is your slight but powerful body."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Marta."
Leslie Knope,"We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Do you know Joe Biden?
Leslie Knope,He's on my celebrity sex list.
Leslie Knope,"Well, he is my celebrity sex list."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think I can.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,She's just doing this for the money.
Leslie Knope,She doesn't even like her own client.
Leslie Knope,This could be the best case scenario for us.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario.
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario!
Leslie Knope,It's official.
Leslie Knope,I hate Jennifer Barkley.
Leslie Knope,"When I go to that senior center, I'm going to go up onstage, and I'm going to viciously attack her."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,"And I should listen to you always because you are a man genius with a taut, narrow frame like a sexy, elf king."
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,You're perfect.
Leslie Knope,Yoohoo.
Leslie Knope,I'm over here.
Leslie Knope,Just about to start my presentation.
Leslie Knope,"I uhoh, stairs."
Leslie Knope,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,How do I get from here to there?
Leslie Knope,I'm not a professional mountain climber.
Leslie Knope,"It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game."
Leslie Knope,What plan?
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.
Leslie Knope,""" We are getting our butts kicked by a guy who is not even in the country."
Leslie Knope,He's making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Leslie Knope,That sounds good.
Leslie Knope,Jennifer Barkley.
Leslie Knope,"You twofaced, carpetbagging"
Leslie Knope,"Hi, nice to see you, too."
Leslie Knope,"You are a twofaced, carpet"
Leslie Knope,"I would never accept anything from a twofaced, carpetbagging"
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Let me get my insults out.
Leslie Knope,I've been practicing it the whole way over here.
Leslie Knope,"Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work."
Leslie Knope,"Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts."
Leslie Knope,My idea is better.
Leslie Knope,How do you know that
Leslie Knope,"God, you're good."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that."
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Perd,"" first of all, and no."
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Which you did.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't."
Leslie Knope,What would you do instead?
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.
Leslie Knope,Course you did.
Leslie Knope,I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.
Leslie Knope,And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.
Leslie Knope,But what if she's right?
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it."
Leslie Knope,But she knows that I know that she knows that She's in our heads.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh They did, they stole our idea."
Leslie Knope,We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.
Leslie Knope,"Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper."
Leslie Knope,"What this is about is Pawnee, and that is what I care about."
Leslie Knope,What Bobby Newport cares about is romping around on some beach in Spain with a floozy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, maybe you hadn't heard of it."
Leslie Knope,"It wasn't in the New York Times or Le Monde, which is what she reads."
Leslie Knope,It was in the Pawnee papers.
Leslie Knope,It's certainly not here.
Leslie Knope,"And I think Pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stays in the city, like I do."
Leslie Knope,"I am going to get drunk, and then I'm going to order a three-course meal where each course is made of dessert."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,How are we going to beat her?
Leslie Knope,Literally.
Leslie Knope,I would have if Bobby Newport hadn't gotten those stupid companies to build factories here.
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,It's my new interview outfit.
Leslie Knope,"Like, ""hey, nice to meet you."
Leslie Knope,"Can't wait for the interview."""
Leslie Knope,Lose this?
Leslie Knope,"To win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky."
Leslie Knope,"Buddy Wood hosts the number one morning show in Indianapolis, and he wants to interview me for a series he's doing on local elections."
Leslie Knope,And last year the five people that he profiled all won.
Leslie Knope,This is a huge break for us.
Leslie Knope,Keep going.
Leslie Knope,I can still hear you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,But I bet these pants will work for the public.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I think this is it.
Leslie Knope,"But do I need a hat, like a bowler, or an edgy scarf?"
Leslie Knope,"No, those endless scarves that come out of your sleeves like a magician."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Come on, did anyone even get hurt?"
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, why don't we all go get a drink, blow off some steam?"
Leslie Knope,Everybody's been working so hard.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, screw it."
Leslie Knope,I got a new outfit.
Leslie Knope,My hair looks amazing.
Leslie Knope,And I have a serious excess of preinterview adrenaline.
Leslie Knope,Who's gonna drink with me?
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,This was such a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Should we get another round?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I love him."
Leslie Knope,"It's just This campaign has turned fun, dorky Ben into grumpy, stressball Ben."
Leslie Knope,It's like dealing with a strict mother who I am confusingly attracted to.
Leslie Knope,Ben is like a MILF.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Right!
Leslie Knope,Tell me about it!
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,Dingdong.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Lady Knope.
Leslie Knope,I mean Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"I'm in, uh, the house watching TV right now."
Leslie Knope,"I'm watching, um Murder She Wrote."
Leslie Knope,I'm watching Murder She Wrote.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,What could be wrong with that?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, here comes me To the airport."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,The interview is back on!
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,"We are so ""drucky."""
Leslie Knope,"I mean ""lunky."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, this interview is a big deal, you guys."
Leslie Knope,"This is a game changer, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I have to do well.
Leslie Knope,"Big idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why are you from Russia?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I feel totally normal."
Leslie Knope,I'm ready to do this.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, for Leslie Knope, anytime."
Leslie Knope,"Just let me know if you need anything else, all right?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Paul."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you got those new I.D. badges."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at that."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"""Helpy"" to hop out."
Leslie Knope,Buddy Wood.
Leslie Knope,Glad you could make it.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the greatest city in the world."
Leslie Knope,I'll be right there.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, do I seem normal to you?"
Leslie Knope,"Like, does everything seem fine?"
Leslie Knope,I seem okay?
Leslie Knope,I don't seem distracted or babbly or anything?
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do smart.
Leslie Knope,It's my pleasure.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for being on my show.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm glad you mentioned it."
Leslie Knope,It is in desperate need of refurbishments.
Leslie Knope,And that is why I'm going to make it a centerpiece of my platform.
Leslie Knope,"Take, uh Joe Appledemas over there."
Leslie Knope,"Joe, say hi."
Leslie Knope,"Joe has been working here since 1996, and his salary has not been raised a nickel."
Leslie Knope,I am gonna work very hard to change
Leslie Knope,"Well, granted, we don't have big city amenities, but I think we more than make up for it with friendly faces and handworking hards hardworking hands."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've discussed that many times, and there's really nothing more to say."
Leslie Knope,I would rather talk about the ways to solve problems in this town.
Leslie Knope,"Buddy, frankly, I don't want to discuss that."
Leslie Knope,"But if you'd like, we can talk about ways that I can improve the airport or our many wonderful parks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, like I said, I don't want to discuss it, Buddy, and, frankly, I don't appreciate your condescending tone."
Leslie Knope,But you know what?
Leslie Knope,"I've had a couple drinks, so what the hell?"
Leslie Knope,Ben and I first
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Preposterous.
Leslie Knope,Are you inebriated?
Leslie Knope,That was bad timing.
Leslie Knope,I am not drunk.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, when you have a jumbo Margarita and some flaming Tequila shots, you can get drunk."
Leslie Knope,This interview is over.
Leslie Knope,Oh This this is not because I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,This is because of the wire.
Leslie Knope,"C'mon Buddy, you cannot air that tape."
Leslie Knope,"I know what tiramisu is, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And sheep don't eat it.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I am so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, that's so sweet I've never had a boyfriend threaten to commit arson for me before."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, um Mr. Wood, I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"We, oh, my God, I can't see."
Leslie Knope,It's so bright out here.
Leslie Knope,"We drove here to ask you, No, to beg you to please destroy that tape."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,That's five pleases.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,Goodbye.
Leslie Knope,Yay! Fun Ben lives.
Leslie Knope,"They say to win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky."
Leslie Knope,I got pretty damn lucky when I met Ben.
Leslie Knope,And I'm lucky that Ann and Tom and all my other friends volunteer to help me out.
Leslie Knope,And I'm super lucky that that tape disappeared.
Leslie Knope,I think we may have used up all our luck tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, not all of it."
Leslie Knope,He's about to get lucky.
Leslie Knope,"It's, it's on."
Leslie Knope,He doesn't even know it yet.
Leslie Knope,Is the coast clear?
Leslie Knope,My sneak around clothes.
Leslie Knope,Is he gone?
Leslie Knope,"Holy hell, that's soft."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, is that Yep!"
Leslie Knope,I think I'm gonna cry.
Leslie Knope,This is like girl heaven.
Leslie Knope,Did he do all this just for you?
Leslie Knope,I love amenities.
Leslie Knope,Look at this one.
Leslie Knope,There's another soft one.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, could I have a moment?"
Leslie Knope,In his seminal 2009 documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the national park system as a America's best idea.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, but you should watch that documentary."
Leslie Knope,"Now I realize that you're drafting the new city budget, and I've heard that you're planning on reducing the parks funding by 8%."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, that cannot happen."
Leslie Knope,I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.
Leslie Knope,"If you hear any of them talking about that ""blonde pain in the ass,"" that's me."
Leslie Knope,"Hold that cork, sir because I'm about to put an adorable face on your proposed cuts."
Leslie Knope,Meet Melody Sternway.
Leslie Knope,She's enrolled in five of our parks programs.
Leslie Knope,Our department is the only thing between her and a life of tube tops and tribal tattoos and barfing in hot tubs.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,What could possibly be wrong about me saving the Parks department budget?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Is this politics?
Leslie Knope,I'm in a good mood.
Leslie Knope,Because the city councilor listened to me.
Leslie Knope,It means I have some juice.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Enjoying the view.
Leslie Knope,I'm just really into you.
Leslie Knope,"Gimme a spin, baby."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,So did Pillner finalize the budget?
Leslie Knope,Are we okay?
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we can fix this."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,We can figure something else out.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, honey, good morning."
Leslie Knope,How did you sleep?
Leslie Knope,I adopted 32 cats and dogs.
Leslie Knope,Do you want pancakes?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make pancakes.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Which one?
Leslie Knope,You talking about this one?
Leslie Knope,This one right here?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that is a pig."
Leslie Knope,This is only temporary until I find a way to keep the shelter open without cutting the Parks budget.
Leslie Knope,"April, that would be the coolest thing since 'N Sync, Aerosmith, and Nelly performed together at the Super Bowl halftime show."
Leslie Knope,"I'm very proud of you, April."
Leslie Knope,"Meanwhile, you and I are gonna look at the town budget and we're gonna find something expendable."
Leslie Knope,Andy put them on the table 'cause he wanted to try to have the dogs play poker.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,This is it.
Leslie Knope,It's an oversight.
Leslie Knope,We get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operating while still maintaining the Parks budget.
Leslie Knope,Looks like we found a bigger bottle.
Leslie Knope,Do you think Barack and Michelle Obama feel like this at the end of the day?
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,We saved the animal shelter and the Parks budget.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,Got rid of a bunch of lameass D1's from Public Works.
Leslie Knope,what now?
Leslie Knope,I just need one more week.
Leslie Knope,And then I think
Leslie Knope,"If I could just get a little bit more time, I could figure out how to fix this."
Leslie Knope,With due respect
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"No, I will not let you return to a life of shaving wieners and dodging knife attacks from meth heads."
Leslie Knope,Or we find money somewhere else.
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,Stop talking.
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,I have half an idea and I'm putting it together.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Heh.
Leslie Knope,I'm No!
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now I have a complete idea."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I'm going to commit political suicide."
Leslie Knope,"Just one item, Jennifer."
Leslie Knope,You're going to announce that Bobby Newport will use his personal fortune to save the animal shelter.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, the water's not good for you either."
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't drink the tap water.
Leslie Knope,Has anyone told you that yet?
Leslie Knope,"Because I told councilman Pillner that if you don't agree to our terms, he should cut the Parks budget."
Leslie Knope,"A safe home for the animals, a job for my friend, and a full Parks budget."
Leslie Knope,"Because in a week, we have a debate."
Leslie Knope,"And your guy Bobby Newport is gonna have to show up, and he's gonna have to open his mouth."
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna kick his ass.
Leslie Knope,She'll take care of that.
Leslie Knope,See ya next week!
Leslie Knope,Is the menu all set?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Can't believe we're doing this here.
Leslie Knope,"Seats, like, 800 people."
Leslie Knope,This is a lot bigger than my high school debate auditorium.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great."
Leslie Knope,I believe that I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,I got this.
Leslie Knope,I have.
Leslie Knope,I finally get a chance to stand in front of everyone and talk about the town that I love.
Leslie Knope,What if the town loves Bobby more than me?
Leslie Knope,I love it when you're needlessly disgusting.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Fierce.
Leslie Knope,Power.
Leslie Knope,Pump it up.
Leslie Knope,2012
Leslie Knope,Nothing gets me more amped than Sarah McLachlan.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,I've worked my whole life to make it great.
Leslie Knope,I believe I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,I have the best campaign manager in the world.
Leslie Knope,Here's what I know.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and I like you."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great."
Leslie Knope,I believe that I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,And maybe that's because he's never earned anything his entire life.
Leslie Knope,It's difficult to get into the complicated problems with Ramsett Park in such a short amount of time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, okay."
Leslie Knope,I will say that the parks in Pawnee
Leslie Knope,I have no more time left?
Leslie Knope,"If I may, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"That's a very sweet story, Bobby, but not all of us have Yolandas who can clean up our room for us."
Leslie Knope,Some of us believe that you need to roll up your sleeves and do the hard work yourself.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, he's winning."
Leslie Knope,How is he winning?
Leslie Knope,"Everything he's saying is nonsense, and he's fooling them."
Leslie Knope,I need to go back on the attack.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I agree that movies should be more faithful to the books that they are based on, but what does that have to do with this election?"
Leslie Knope,"I was in favor of closing the borders bookstore, not the border to Mexico."
Leslie Knope,Let's spend our money on what matters.
Leslie Knope,"Police, fire, parks, and schools."
Leslie Knope,So Sweetums is gonna move to Mexico if Bobby doesn't win?
Leslie Knope,How could they do that to this town?
Leslie Knope,What a crappy stunt to pull.
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,I think we attack him.
Leslie Knope,He's more confident now.
Leslie Knope,I have to attack him.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure out as I'm saying it.
Leslie Knope,Just let me attack him.
Leslie Knope,I want to attack him.
Leslie Knope,I can do it.
Leslie Knope,I can crush him.
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I'm very angry.
Leslie Knope,I'm angry that Bobby Newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you don't give him what he wants.
Leslie Knope,It's despicable.
Leslie Knope,Corporations are not allowed to dictate what a city needs.
Leslie Knope,That power belongs to the people.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport and his daddy would like you to think it belongs to them.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,"And when you love something, you don't threaten it."
Leslie Knope,You don't punish it.
Leslie Knope,You fight for it.
Leslie Knope,You take care of it.
Leslie Knope,You put it first.
Leslie Knope,"As your city councilor, I will make sure that no one takes advantage of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"If I seem too passionate, it's because I care."
Leslie Knope,"If I come on strong, it's because I feel strongly."
Leslie Knope,"And if push too hard, it's because things aren't moving fast enough."
Leslie Knope,This is my home.
Leslie Knope,You are my family.
Leslie Knope,And I promise you I'm not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,Was I too mean?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how was the spin room?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I think you should deliver the news."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but you're the brilliant campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"I know, you guys, we only have one more day to close the gap, and we're going to do so in a onetime campaign blitz aboard the S.S. Knope"
Leslie Knope,This is going to be our home for the next 24 hours.
Leslie Knope,"And if we win, hopefully, it will be the home that Ben and I share forever."
Leslie Knope,It's just an idea I had.
Leslie Knope,We don't have to do it.
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,We can talk about it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,We've come so far.
Leslie Knope,"I want this so bad, I can taste it."
Leslie Knope,"When I close my eyes, I can picture the flash of the cameras at my swearing in."
Leslie Knope,And I can hear the sound of the applause when I take my oath.
Leslie Knope,And I can see in the crowd president Obama smiling at me.
Leslie Knope,He made it.
Leslie Knope,"I didn't think he would come, but he made it."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, buddy."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we worked really hard to get those seniors back on our side after that ramp debacle."
Leslie Knope,I really need their votes.
Leslie Knope,I have total faith in you.
Leslie Knope,Take Donna with you.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you go too."
Leslie Knope,"April, you are a very intelligent and savvy young woman."
Leslie Knope,"I do not just think of you as just a gofer, but right now, I need you to get me a triple espresso with eight sugars."
Leslie Knope,What do we want for our city?
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I want.
Leslie Knope,"I want better schools, I want cleaner streets, I want to expel the violent gangs of geese in Detweiler Square."
Leslie Knope,And I will finally eliminate this city's libraries!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I tell ya, these geese don't give me no respect."
Leslie Knope,No respect at all.
Leslie Knope,"When I was building parks, helping the community, and putting together the harvest festival, where was Bobby?"
Leslie Knope,"He and his father, Nick Newport were exploiting this city for their personal gain."
Leslie Knope,You deserve more.
Leslie Knope,"Together, we can build a better Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"And if elected, I promise to stop the Newports and Sweetums from blatantly dumping contaminants into the Pawnee river."
Leslie Knope,Nick Newport has been intimidating and bullying and poisoning this town for years.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, he's a real jerk, and if he thinks he can buy this election for his son, he's wrong."
Leslie Knope,He died?
Leslie Knope,I Sad.
Leslie Knope,"No, my official statement is that is overall, a bummer."
Leslie Knope,Oof.
Leslie Knope,And and together we can build a better Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"No, this is isn't the time."
Leslie Knope,"No, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, he's a real jerk."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, emergency meeting."
Leslie Knope,I need everyone to gather around me in order of how much I trust them.
Leslie Knope,Here's the situation.
Leslie Knope,A man has died.
Leslie Knope,"But that man is 98 years old, and he's an awful man."
Leslie Knope,"However, he is a man, and he died."
Leslie Knope,"However, he was a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"He put a lot of people out of work, he had tons of mistresses, he polluted this town."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, what do we do?"
Leslie Knope,"Good answer, great body."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, try to beat what he said."
Leslie Knope,Not with that attitude.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, there is nothing harder in the entire world than saying no to your beautiful face."
Leslie Knope,But I'm going to.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,We're going to keep campaigning.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but we're going to do it in a classy and respectful way to get Ann off of our backs."
Leslie Knope,"What's next on the ""schedge?"""
Leslie Knope,"""We're all your friends,"" said Mr."
Leslie Knope,bacon.
Leslie Knope,"""Welcome home."
Leslie Knope,""" The end."
Leslie Knope,"And that is Groffle, the awful Waffle, a book that I wrote and published on behalf of my education initiative."
Leslie Knope,Any questions?
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,"Ah well, I should not have called Nick Newport a jerk, because we need to be respectful of all dead people."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, not Stalin or Hitler, but I'm not calling Nick Newport Hitler."
Leslie Knope,I'm never going to get away from these Nick Newport questions.
Leslie Knope,Nice.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, for once, this is not about you."
Leslie Knope,A man is dead.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, how do we leak this to the press?"
Leslie Knope,"Do we, like, release a statement?"
Leslie Knope,Do we call somebody?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, why are there so many people here?"
Leslie Knope,Turn around!
Leslie Knope,Back it up!
Leslie Knope,Back it up!
Leslie Knope,Go forward!
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"Hi Sorry, are we late?"
Leslie Knope,"No way, that's not us."
Leslie Knope,You don't know us at all.
Leslie Knope,We wouldn't even think it.
Leslie Knope,"We brought a ""sorry for your loss"" fruit basket for Bobby."
Leslie Knope,And it is very classy.
Leslie Knope,"No melon, no apples."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's my fault."
Leslie Knope,And you know what?
Leslie Knope,Jen is right.
Leslie Knope,I'm no better than her.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann, but where was that advice six hours ago?"
Leslie Knope,I had to try.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,Why don't you play with the real one?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can we talk for a second?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry your dad died, and I'm really, really sorry I called him a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"You know, my mom was a great athlete when she was a kid."
Leslie Knope,"So in junior high, I joined the track team to impress her, even though I hated it."
Leslie Knope,"And at the end of the year, I ran the 5,000 meters in this huge track event."
Leslie Knope,And I finished dead last.
Leslie Knope,And I thought that she was going to be really disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,But she wasn't.
Leslie Knope,"She ran up to me, and she wrapped me up in this big hug, and she told me she had never been more proud of me."
Leslie Knope,"You finished this race, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,"The campaign is over, and you finished."
Leslie Knope,"Win or lose, I bet you anything that your dad was proud of you."
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,That's my story.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Once again, I have to object."
Leslie Knope,"I'm never against anyone getting a candy bar, but watch what happens when you vote for me."
Leslie Knope,Then you have to press it again.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport and I are separated by a razor thin margin.
Leslie Knope,Could go either way.
Leslie Knope,"I've only slept nine hours over the past four days, so I'm right on the verge of a nervous breakdown."
Leslie Knope,This isn't a bagel.
Leslie Knope,The reason why Bobby and I are appearing together is to send the message that everyone should get out and vote no matter who they're voting for.
Leslie Knope,They're laughing at your joke.
Leslie Knope,You're not voting for yourself?
Leslie Knope,Anything else?
Leslie Knope,Don't touch it.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I feel like I'm forgetting something.
Leslie Knope,What about my speeches?
Leslie Knope,What if I tie?
Leslie Knope,"You need to write a tie speech for me, something about the poetic nature of democracy and how I'm going fight this thing from my prison cell"
Leslie Knope,What were you talking to Jen about?
Leslie Knope,You have plenty of jeans.
Leslie Knope,What were you talking about?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's amazing."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""yes?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We'll just talk about it.
Leslie Knope,"You know, we'll mull it over, we'll look at it from every side."
Leslie Knope,"Et cetera, et cetera."
Leslie Knope,"Just I'm going to go vote, just fulfill a lifelong dream of mine and achieve one of my all time happiest moments real quick, and then we will talk about it."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, just hang on a second, Bobby."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's it.
Leslie Knope,"It's not Bobby Newport who's going to beat me, it's Brandi Maxxxx, the porn star."
Leslie Knope,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Italy?
Leslie Knope,You did?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,"I've said this to you before, and I know it makes you uncomfortable"
Leslie Knope,"But you're thoughtful, and you're brilliant, and your ambiguous ethnic blend perfectly represents the dream of the American melting pot."
Leslie Knope,Did I hit your boob?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,That was good.
Leslie Knope,I'm exhausted.
Leslie Knope,How long was that?
Leslie Knope,"Boy, that's disappointing."
Leslie Knope,I just I've been running for office the entire time we've been dating.
Leslie Knope,We're just about to get our lives back.
Leslie Knope,It would kill me if he left.
Leslie Knope,"Election results, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, Ann, I can't read it."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, my hands."
Leslie Knope,"My hands, Ann."
Leslie Knope,They're in these round gloves.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's get your hands back up.
Leslie Knope,Go another eight seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, I'm so tired."
Leslie Knope,I'm just going to say this.
Leslie Knope,And I realize this after speaking with my best friend and relationship advisor Ann Perkins from the department of health.
Leslie Knope,I don't want you to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,"I know it's an amazing opportunity, but in just a few minutes, all this craziness is going to be over, and I just want to have dinner with you."
Leslie Knope,Like normal people.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God."
Leslie Knope,What a relief.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Because my dream is dead.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, [Bleep]."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there's no deal in the world that we would ever possibly"
Leslie Knope,"Now, hang on."
Leslie Knope,That's interesting.
Leslie Knope,I was really looking forward to sitting in it.
Leslie Knope,Figured this might be my last chance.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for the last six months, my friends have worked so hard."
Leslie Knope,"Every five minute coffee break at work, every night, every weekend, every spare moment of their lives, they gave to me."
Leslie Knope,"If I lose, I'll never forgive myself."
Leslie Knope,You deserve to win.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Do you have both my speeches?
Leslie Knope,I got you something.
Leslie Knope,Let me open it for you.
Leslie Knope,You have to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,I was being selfish.
Leslie Knope,You put your whole life on hold for me.
Leslie Knope,The very least I can do is try to return the favor.
Leslie Knope,We can make it work.
Leslie Knope,"I will visit you, then you come visit me."
Leslie Knope,And then I go visit you again.
Leslie Knope,And then we make out in the Lincoln bedroom And the Jefferson Memorial and the Supreme Court gallery.
Leslie Knope,We'll do it all over Washington.
Leslie Knope,From my office.
Leslie Knope,"I have, like, 50 of them."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"That was really sneaky, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Some day, when I'm more emotionally stable, I want to read the concession speech you wrote for me."
Leslie Knope,"The idea behind this campaign was a simple one: That with hard work and positivity, a group of people can make a difference during my term as your city councilor Thank you."
Leslie Knope,I want to focus on your hopes and not your fears.
Leslie Knope,I want to solve problems instead of creating friction.
Leslie Knope,And I will work hard every hour of every day to make Pawnee a better place to live because I love this city.
Leslie Knope,"And I know firsthand, how very special the people of this city are."
Leslie Knope,"I owe this victory, all of it, to my friends and my supporters."
Leslie Knope,No one achieves anything alone.
Leslie Knope,So let's embark on a new journey together.
Leslie Knope,Let's break out a map.
Leslie Knope,"Not the old, out-of-date one that shows where we've been, but a crisp new one that shows where we might go."
Leslie Knope,Let's embark on a new journey together and see where it takes us.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we're going to JJ's for victory waffles, and then we're staying up all night talking about our lives and our feelings."
Leslie Knope,Nonnegotiable.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go! City council, bitches!"
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Washington, D.C."
Leslie Knope,"Take a deep breath, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you can practically smell the bills becoming laws."
Leslie Knope,You can taste the sweet sugar of bureaucracy at work.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it's not."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's the Capitol.
Leslie Knope,"My amazing lover, Ben Wyatt, is here working on a congressional campaign."
Leslie Knope,And he took April with him as his intern.
Leslie Knope,"I'm here to visit, but I am also here to work, because I have a very important meeting where I am going to try to get federal funding so we can clean up the Pawnee river."
Leslie Knope,It's a bit of a fixer upper.
Leslie Knope,"Romantic reunions, government meetings, selfguided museum tours I mean, am I living the dream?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Did I also just walk past a food truck and buy myself a waffle sundae?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Now take out your guidebook.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I brought you one."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Now throw it away, 'cause Leslie Knope is your guidebook."
Leslie Knope,I didn't I didn't mean literally.
Leslie Knope,There were some notes in it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, grab the book, and let's hit the National Mall."
Leslie Knope,"""In this temple, ""As in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever."""
Leslie Knope,"Andy, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,Nothing in that movie is accurate.
Leslie Knope,I think that's just gum.
Leslie Knope,Because it's gum.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So you can see that the color changes about a third of the way up, and it's when construction was actually halted on the monument"
Leslie Knope,Let's talk on the way.
Leslie Knope,"1776, a nation is born."
Leslie Knope,So I want to see the history of the girl scouts and then Lincoln's pocket watch and the First Ladies exhibit and everything I want to see everything.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, get down from there."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, you protect our nation's history, and you're a hero."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,It's so good to see you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, uh, guys, let's motor."
Leslie Knope,Guys.
Leslie Knope,Guys.
Leslie Knope,Let's go get some astronaut ice cream or something.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You look great, April."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could sightsee together.
Leslie Knope,Farewell address candle stand.
Leslie Knope,That was the first thing I was going to see.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love you so much."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And it was nice to see you again.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are a power couple, like the Roosevelts or the Clintons."
Leslie Knope,I've got a big meeting here.
Leslie Knope,Ben is off running a congressional campaign.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the only way we could be more awesome is if we had our own signature dance move."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait."
Leslie Knope,We do.
Leslie Knope,"Three, four."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I have a 3:00 with Mr. Jepson.
Leslie Knope,I'm here to present my application for the Federal Riverbed Preservation Grant.
Leslie Knope,I'm not most people.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,I was told I would have a facetoface meeting with him so I could make my case for my town.
Leslie Knope,Does he have office hours?
Leslie Knope,Oh Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's kind of a special application.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, you know, there's aa CD inside that, uh, plays the sound of a babbling river, and I was going to play that while I gave my presentation."
Leslie Knope,I was also going to show a DVD that had some images of frolicking river otters.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Indiana.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Um, I think okay."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at you."
Leslie Knope,You're a big shot.
Leslie Knope,I was just recently elected.
Leslie Knope,I'm a councilwoman.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It's called Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, Missouri, is a total craphole."
Leslie Knope,Ben and I both did some amazing things today.
Leslie Knope,He scored a victory for the congressional campaign he's working on.
Leslie Knope,And I was mistaken for Beverly D'Angelo by a Japanese tourist.
Leslie Knope,"So, pretty big day for both of us."
Leslie Knope,Does anybody feel like they can't breathe?
Leslie Knope,I think I need some fresh air.
Leslie Knope,"God, these women they're so smart and accomplished and pretty."
Leslie Knope,And they're tall.
Leslie Knope,Why are they all so tall?
Leslie Knope,It's like CSpan and Neiman Marcus had kids or something.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I can't wait to meet, like, five more tall women."
Leslie Knope,How do you do?
Leslie Knope,"I am a city councilwoman from Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,But you've probably never heard of us.
Leslie Knope,We're small and unimportant.
Leslie Knope,But it is.
Leslie Knope,We've got tons of problems.
Leslie Knope,We're overrun with raccoons and obese toddlers.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm probably boring you."
Leslie Knope,"I just wanted to say that you are my role models, and, uh, you are incredibly amazing women, and it is an honor to meet you, and I really respect your grace under pressure, And thank you for your time."
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just tired, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I saw 24 historical sights in a day, and it's 120 degrees out with 200% humidity, because this is a stupid swamp town."
Leslie Knope,I'm not cranky.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,You're the most amazing boyfriend ever.
Leslie Knope,"And if you don't get out of here soon, I'm going to punch you in the face."
Leslie Knope,It's fine.
Leslie Knope,Just go.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at your apartment later.
Leslie Knope,"Could you give me a minute here, please?"
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to just leave and give me a little privacy here, please."
Leslie Knope,Nosy people have no respect for personal space.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,"I know I should be focusing on this river cleanup, but all I keep thinking about is Ben laughing in a helicopter with Hot Rebecca."
Leslie Knope,She's just this jealousy amalgam I created.
Leslie Knope,"I combined all of the giant, darkhaired, smartphone power goddesses into one woman called Hot Rebecca."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, Ben's life is filled with senators and briefings and Super PACs."
Leslie Knope,I can't even get a meeting with some bureaucrat.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,I went to our nation's capital this weekend in order to apply for a federal grant to clean up our city's river.
Leslie Knope,"But things move pretty slow in Washington, and I'm not going to wait around."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I was recently reminded by someone that I'm not the type of person to shy away from hard work."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,"Point is, I'm going to clean up this river by myself."
Leslie Knope,"Every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., I will be here."
Leslie Knope,Those are my office hours.
Leslie Knope,"If you want to come and talk to me or ask me questions or raise an issue, this is where I'll be."
Leslie Knope,"Let's get to work, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,The smell is so much worse when you get up close.
Leslie Knope,Holy
Leslie Knope,"No, No, no."
Leslie Knope,You did nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy for you and how much everyone loves you and how great you're doing.
Leslie Knope,I just freaked out.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,It does.
Leslie Knope,"But we can do this, right?"
Leslie Knope,There's only one sight I want to see right now.
Leslie Knope,"I meant the Jefferson Memorial, you perv."
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't."
Leslie Knope,Spin it around and back it on up.
Leslie Knope,Your parents went away on a week's vacation.
Leslie Knope,They left the keys to the brand new Porsche.
Leslie Knope,Would they mind?
Leslie Knope,"Well, of course not."
Leslie Knope,"I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah!"
Leslie Knope,"Of course I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot Pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girly girl walking I picked up my car phone To perpetrate like I was talking"
Leslie Knope,"Sunroof was open, the music was high And that girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car I can't believe it!"
Leslie Knope,I made a mistake But parents are the same No matter time nor place So to all you kids all across the land No need to argue Parents just don't understand Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Just a little something I know.
Leslie Knope,"So, what's up?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I've been spending the summer doing a lot of zoo promotions.
Leslie Knope,Parrots live a very long time.
Leslie Knope,So we had a birthday party for a parrot that turned 60.
Leslie Knope,"Chimpanzees are very smart, so we had them graduate from college."
Leslie Knope,"And they like to fling their feces, so we were hoping that they would fling their hats."
Leslie Knope,But they just flung their feces.
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Zoo recently purchased two South African blackfooted penguins, Tux and Flipper."
Leslie Knope,"And as part of our zoo promotion, we are going to give them a marriage ceremony, because they mate for life."
Leslie Knope,"Tux, do you take Flipper, to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
Leslie Knope,I do!
Leslie Knope,I do!
Leslie Knope,"By the power vested in me from the Department of Parks and Recreation, I now pronounce you husband and wife!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, at least they're married."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?
Leslie Knope,"Still, you couldn't have asked for better weather."
Leslie Knope,"Brendanawicz, you big sandwich eater."
Leslie Knope,"Just to be clear, that was a friend punch."
Leslie Knope,There was no flirtatious meaning behind that playful punch I just gave your arm.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it good to be able to just kind of horse around like this as friends?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't stick my neck out."
Leslie Knope,It was an accident.
Leslie Knope,I'm in the mainstream.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Not out of it.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Uh-uh.
Leslie Knope,People in this town don't really like their government employees being activists.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, a garbage man was suspended for wearing a Live Strong bracelet."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has a gay bar?
Leslie Knope,The Bulge is a gay bar?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, the nights I've wasted there."
Leslie Knope,They thought that was a political gesture?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, nobody eat that cake."
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Leslie Knope,Step into my office.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, whatever."
Leslie Knope,I know that you are not gay.
Leslie Knope,But you're effeminate.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're wearing a peach shirt with a coiled snake on it."
Leslie Knope,Effeminate.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, so the point is, do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement?"
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look, they sent us a Tshirt."
Leslie Knope,Hmmâ¦
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, sorry, what's the situation?"
Leslie Knope,How does this work?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"The thing about youth culture is, I don't understand it."
Leslie Knope,So what can I do for you guys?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, April, please, it was just penguins."
Leslie Knope,"I'm a public servant, and I'm not allowed to take a political stance."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Who made this?
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,I'm the guest of honor at this gay bar tonight.
Leslie Knope,I guess gay men are starting to like me.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I guess they think I'm fabulous or something.
Leslie Knope,That was hands down the best interaction I've ever had with Donna.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello."
Leslie Knope,I love your top.
Leslie Knope,"Well, what can I do for you and those fine people at the SFSF?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're serious?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry, but hold on a second there, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,"That was not my intention, at all."
Leslie Knope,Because I firmly believed that it would be cute.
Leslie Knope,And it was.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,"Soon, probably."
Leslie Knope,"I have a plan, but, no, not now."
Leslie Knope,Not dating anyone yet.
Leslie Knope,Focusing on my career.
Leslie Knope,"It's a left, yeah."
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,I hate salad.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me, neither."
Leslie Knope,"Look, let's invent our own secret language that only we understand."
Leslie Knope,And then we can use it around people and no one will know what we're talking about.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm feeling a lot of confusing things right now.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I just want to let you know, I was really serious about that secret language."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe this is a gay bar.
Leslie Knope,Where should I drink now?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen."
Leslie Knope,Here's the plan.
Leslie Knope,"Our position is, we have no position."
Leslie Knope,"So let's just say, ""Thank you for the party, but we regretfully decline your offer to honor me."""
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,That's nice.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I'm really enjoying this hug.
Leslie Knope,"That's so nice, but I need to tell you something."
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it's freeâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,Gentlemen.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would just like to say thank you so much for throwing me this party, especially on a night when the Colts are playing."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,This is green.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to tell you that I wasn't really trying to take a stand when I married those penguins."
Leslie Knope,You're chanting my name.
Leslie Knope,I just have one thing to say!
Leslie Knope,Together we can change Pawnee forever!
Leslie Knope,Let's dance!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,They're having a party in my honor!
Leslie Knope,Go to the bar.
Leslie Knope,"If you're my friend, you can drink for free!"
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're here!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Get a drink!
Leslie Knope,You know why tonight's fun?
Leslie Knope,'Cause everyone's so gay.
Leslie Knope,"And they know how to have fun, and the dancing!"
Leslie Knope,"Just, it's... Everyone is just who they are."
Leslie Knope,And who they are is just stone cold gay.
Leslie Knope,"Can't read my Can't read my No, he can't read my poker face Blah, blah, blah, blah My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face"
Leslie Knope,I'm having such a nice time tonight.
Leslie Knope,I've met many interesting people.
Leslie Knope,"And there's two bisexual guys here, and I got both of their phone numbers."
Leslie Knope,"My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face"
Leslie Knope,Show me what's hot Tell me what I got Can't read my Can't read my
Leslie Knope,"I had three drinks named after me, so that's pretty fun."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, Ben and Derek are taking me shopping on Saturday."
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna find out my actual bra size.
Leslie Knope,I guess I'm kind of like queen of the gays.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's huge.
Leslie Knope,What's the topic?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I haven't even officially taken a stand on gay marriage.
Leslie Knope,That was me.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo."
Leslie Knope,It's kind of like the Meet the Press of our town.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.
Leslie Knope,I just wish I were here under different circumstances.
Leslie Knope,Tom comes on the show all the time.
Leslie Knope,Joan loves him.
Leslie Knope,I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone.
Leslie Knope,"I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo."
Leslie Knope,Oh! Is that it?
Leslie Knope,Anything else? You want me to jump off a building? Perform hara-kiri?
Leslie Knope,This is the reason why people don't go into politics.
Leslie Knope,"Because, I bust my ass for the people in this city, and I can't win."
Leslie Knope,"I have one night of fun with some of the best dancers I've ever danced with, and suddenly everybody's freaking out?"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Let's go for it.
Leslie Knope,Bring it on.
Leslie Knope,How does this work?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hey! You're on the air!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Next caller.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, two for resign."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Next caller.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.
Leslie Knope,"Attendance is up 30% at the zoo, by the way."
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"That penguin wedding was cute, damn it."
Leslie Knope,And I'm not gonna annul it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me, because it's not gonna happen, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,"Last time I checked, I don't think I murdered anyone, or had an affair, or did drugs! But I apologize."
Leslie Knope,"I apologize for having fun, and for making something cute!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no! What did I do?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I will not be annulling.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Look at them.
Leslie Knope,They're just in their own little penguin love bubble.
Leslie Knope,I guess that's what it's like when you meet your mate and know you're gonna be together forever.
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,You know what I realized?
Leslie Knope,We're just animals.
Leslie Knope,We don't know anything about love.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I think you should go on that date with Mark.
Leslie Knope,"Really, seriously."
Leslie Knope,"I thought about it, and, look, he might not be my gay penguin, but he could be yours."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"If you don't want to go out with him, don't go out with him."
Leslie Knope,"But don't not do it because of me, because I'm really fine with it."
Leslie Knope,All that's important to me is that we're still friends.
Leslie Knope,Good! Great.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I already called him and told him that you were dying to go out with him, so have fun."
Leslie Knope,"So, I transferred the penguins to a zoo in lowa."
Leslie Knope,"Gay marriage is legal there, so hopefully, they'll be happy."
Leslie Knope,At least they'll be together.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look! Six Flags! I should take them on a water slide."
Leslie Knope,They might die.
Leslie Knope,But it would be so cute!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so do you have the results of the study?"
Leslie Knope,That is gross.
Leslie Knope,All that sugar?
Leslie Knope,What a powerful image.
Leslie Knope,What did you put in the sugar?
Leslie Knope,It's so good.
Leslie Knope,My first act as a city councilwoman I've proposed a tax on all those giant sugary sodas so we can discourage people from drinking them.
Leslie Knope,"I believe, with my help, all local restaurants can get healthier Paunch Burger, Big and Wide, The Fat Sack, Coronel Plum's Slop Trough which was formerly Sue's Salads until we ran that out of town."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm really glad that you're here."
Leslie Knope,"Our political differences aside, I am about to go to my first committee meeting as a city councilwoman."
Leslie Knope,There's something I need to say to you.
Leslie Knope,"I know you hate feelings and emotions, but I would not be where I am if it wasn't for you."
Leslie Knope,You hired me.
Leslie Knope,You've always supported me.
Leslie Knope,How can I ever repay you?
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, recently, many of the local restaurants have changed their ""small size"" option to a whopping 64ounces."
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh, Paunch Burger just recently came out with a new 128ounce option."
Leslie Knope,"Most people call it a gallon, but they call it the ""regular."""
Leslie Knope,"Then, there is a horrifying 512 ounce version that they call ""child size."""
Leslie Knope,"""How is this a ""childsize soda""?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ms. Pinewood, but why would anybody need this much soda?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about water zero.
Leslie Knope,"The name implies that there are zero calories, like most water, but in fact, it has 300 calories per serving."
Leslie Knope,Isn't that misleading?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think we're done here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,You're bluffing.
Leslie Knope,She's bluffing.
Leslie Knope,Are you bluffing?
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope Soda Tax Forces Massive Layoffs."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I need some sugar.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,"I proposed this bill, but the issue has become very complicated, so before I decide how I am going to vote, I'd love to hear from both sides."
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Well, sir, I may vote against the tax, because, frankly, I don't take job losses lightly."
Leslie Knope,"Well, ma'am, my original stance was that implementing this tax would be good for public health."
Leslie Knope,"Grover, give that woman her purse back."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, anyone else?"
Leslie Knope,"Sir, you don't pay your income tax?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, no, actually, it is."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, um, let's take a quick straw poll."
Leslie Knope,Hold up green if you agree and red if you disagree.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,"So, about half?"
Leslie Knope,Half and half.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope,This is very confusing.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,So do you.
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.
Leslie Knope,You always look beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I couldn't sleep a wink last night, so at 5:00 in the morning, I went to Paunch Burger for a pickmeup."
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't decide what kind of soda I wanted, so I had them put all six in one cup."
Leslie Knope,You know what it tastes like?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"If I vote for the tax, then I might lose my job, and if I vote against it, I might be betraying my own bill."
Leslie Knope,It's like I'm floating in this giant river of ambiguity.
Leslie Knope,I'm under a warm waterfall of uncertainty.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I've lost all of my instincts.
Leslie Knope,I'm lost.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna have to wait, and when they call my name, I'll do what my gut tells me to do."
Leslie Knope,Uhh!
Leslie Knope,"Gentlemen, it appears that I have fallen ill."
Leslie Knope,"Mayhaps, might I suggest that we have a aah!"
Leslie Knope,Can we take a recess?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm a mess."
Leslie Knope,"Everything's upside down, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, when I used to just work here, I was always so sure of myself."
Leslie Knope,Now everything is different.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, my rock, my steady, guiding light."
Leslie Knope,"O Captain, my Captain."
Leslie Knope,"I need you, Ron, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I'm in big trouble.
Leslie Knope,"I need to go back to those chambers in 20 minutes, and I have to cast a vote, and I don't know what I'm gonna do."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, the people at the public forum said they might want to fire me."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, come on."
Leslie Knope,Be serious.
Leslie Knope,"""Brilliant work."""
Leslie Knope,"""Commendation."""
Leslie Knope,"""Above and beyond."""
Leslie Knope,"""Request for termination""? You tried to fire me once?"
Leslie Knope,What you me four four fired times?
Leslie Knope,I don't understand.
Leslie Knope,Why did you try to get me fired?
Leslie Knope,I was a dedicated public servant.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I had conviction because I knew what I believed in, but I know with this new job."
Leslie Knope,I just feel like I've lost my bearings.
Leslie Knope,Are you gonna pull out some embarrassing photo of me from high school?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"And, listen, as far as this firing stuff goes, I won't forget and I will never forgive you."
Leslie Knope,Aye.
Leslie Knope,Strongly in favor.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'm very pleased with my vote because I voted my conscience."
Leslie Knope,"And by the way, she's totally bluffing about laying people off, you watch."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I may have made some enemies today, but that is part of the job."
Leslie Knope,"And who knows, maybe in the future, my enemies will become my friends."
Leslie Knope,Stranger things have happened.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,I miss you.
Leslie Knope,Where are you?
Leslie Knope,I'm in my new city council office.
Leslie Knope,"I know, do you like it?"
Leslie Knope,"I love it, too."
Leslie Knope,Check this out.
Leslie Knope,Here is my wall of inspirational women.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I am big enough to admit that I am often inspired by myself.
Leslie Knope,Here are my clocks.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee and Washington D.C.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is the coolest part ever."
Leslie Knope,I have my own private bathroom.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Jamm.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing in my bathroom?
Leslie Knope,Its only door is in my office.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No deal.
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,"No, that's your opinion."
Leslie Knope,That's the definition of an opinion.
Leslie Knope,"The city council has some political gridlock and some partisan bickering, but we're actually about to pass a bill my bill the Leslie Knope Fun In The Sun Act, which will extend public pool hours citywide."
Leslie Knope,"Recently, the Captain of the Pawnee Porpoises swim team asked me if we could keep the public pools open longer so they could log more practice time, and I said, ""Absolutely."""
Leslie Knope,Because not only am I a city councilor.
Leslie Knope,I'm a city councilor with porpoise.
Leslie Knope,"By passing the bill, and extending pool hours, we are saying to our citizens that this City Council is determined to better our town."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Pawnee Porpoises youth swim team, I have a question for you."
Leslie Knope,What is your greatest accomplishment?
Leslie Knope,"Wrong, your greatest accomplishment is happening in two hours when this bill becomes law."
Leslie Knope,"I just want you to be very proud of yourselves, because this bill is going to start a long romance between the city and its government."
Leslie Knope,Porpoise call!
Leslie Knope,"I'm doing a porpoise call, which we used to do when I was part of your group, but it seems like you don't do it any more and that's fine."
Leslie Knope,I'm not weird.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody leave."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the city council meeting.
Leslie Knope,I have wanted this perm since middle school.
Leslie Knope,I could not be more excited about this.
Leslie Knope,"Are you excited, Autumn?"
Leslie Knope,Do you ever give a perm to someone and ever regret it?
Leslie Knope,Uh Ann has told me repeatedly not to get a perm.
Leslie Knope,But Ann's not here.
Leslie Knope,"So when the Ann's away, the mice get perms."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,He promised me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,The vote is in an hour.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need to have an emergency strategy session now."
Leslie Knope,"The perm must wait, Autumn!"
Leslie Knope,The perm must wait.
Leslie Knope,"Now, wait, okay, hold on."
Leslie Knope,This isn't over by a long shot.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know how to do math, Mason."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't be an alarmist."
Leslie Knope,It's very important that we stay positive.
Leslie Knope,Our positive attitude is our greatest asset.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, a word, please."
Leslie Knope,"The bill is dead, the Porpoises are doomed, and democracy is over."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I decided to get a perm.
Leslie Knope,Ann should have never let me do this.
Leslie Knope,"You know, this is why people hate the government."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause just when we're about to do something really good, it all falls apart due to some stupid, selfish jerk butt."
Leslie Knope,"You know, screw Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Screw Jamm.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going to try to get Councilman Milton's vote.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"He's got grandkids, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And and kids love to swim.
Leslie Knope,And he'll give us his vote.
Leslie Knope,"He's an old person, and I'll talk to him really slowly."
Leslie Knope,He won't even know what he's doing.
Leslie Knope,I just need to hurry up.
Leslie Knope,How do I look?
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, I'd like to talk to you about the Fun In The Sun bill, and I don't mean to rush you, but the vote is in an hour."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton was first elected as a city councilor in 1948, as a member of the Dixiecrat Party."
Leslie Knope,Their platform?
Leslie Knope,"""Deintegrate Baseball."""
Leslie Knope,"Tom, eat some."
Leslie Knope,"The more we eat, the faster we talk."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, you have grandchildren"
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's very hard to tell."
Leslie Knope,This might not work.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Iceland.
Leslie Knope,Jamm!
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,Support of one of your bills?
Leslie Knope,Committee chairmanship?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,This isn't even about policy?
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Leslie Knope,I'm not happy.
Leslie Knope,He shoots down a very helpful bill 'cause he doesn't get to poop wherever he wants?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm gonna get Councilman Milton, and you can put your butt back in your pants, sir."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do I have your vote?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there's a lot of salad dressing on your hand."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,Please be okay.
Leslie Knope,"Please, still be able to vote."
Leslie Knope,We can kiss if you want to.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know, maybe we should, you know, postpone the vote until the councilman gets better, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,I have excellent toothbrush technique.
Leslie Knope,I do not negotiate with dentists.
Leslie Knope,"I'm trying to tell everybody that the government is great, and I think it stinks."
Leslie Knope,I hate it.
Leslie Knope,I hate the government.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I take it back.
Leslie Knope,"Why did I say that, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,"God, you know me so well."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, I move that the bill be read in its entirety."
Leslie Knope,Ms. Beavers?
Leslie Knope,You can have my office.
Leslie Knope,You can have my parking space.
Leslie Knope,And I will get Invisaligns from you.
Leslie Knope,"And, that is enough."
Leslie Knope,And shut up.
Leslie Knope,And I hate you.
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's get ready for the photo, guys."
Leslie Knope,I want you to arrange yourselves from most excited about democracy to least excited.
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,Everybody's excited? I bet you are! Because your bill just became law.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can you not say that in front of the kids, please? I'm trying to teach them how great government is."
Leslie Knope,"Um Um, because it's fun in the sun! Everybody in the pool!"
Leslie Knope,"Yay, democracy! Oh, no, my perm."
Leslie Knope,Ta da.
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And it is across the courtyard from your office, so we can wave at each other."
Leslie Knope,"But it is also Pawnee's newest and most exclusive cigar club, Tom's Smokehouse."
Leslie Knope,And the Tommy Haverford member's chair.
Leslie Knope,I ain't scared of him.
Leslie Knope,He's a punk.
Leslie Knope,To making things happen.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,What's with the getup?
Leslie Knope,A cowboy hat from your cowboy friend.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that makes it sound like he's a cow."
Leslie Knope,From your cowboy boyfriend.
Leslie Knope,Your boy cow cow boy.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Great news: Lots of old people have chlamydia.
Leslie Knope,"Seniors in Pawnee have a lot of time on their hands, and what they're doing with that time is going at it hard, old people style."
Leslie Knope,"A lot of them haven't had proper sex education, and as a result, STDs are having a field day."
Leslie Knope,It's amazing what a few old guys can do with a little bit of charm and a lot of crabs.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sex avengers, these old fogies are very set in their ways."
Leslie Knope,"They're hopped up on E.D. medication and they got nothing to lose, 'cause they're close to death."
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Let's pretend that we're old people, and we can ask Ann our grossest, most perverted sex questions."
Leslie Knope,I'll start.
Leslie Knope,"I'm an old lady, why do I need birth control?"
Leslie Knope,I haven't had my monthly since LBJ was president.
Leslie Knope,"I think you're good to go, nursey."
Leslie Knope,I want to jump on that caboose.
Leslie Knope,Choo choo!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"That's how you do it, kids."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, can everyone hear me okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"I'm councilwoman Leslie Knope, and today we are here to talk about safe sex."
Leslie Knope,"I know this is a personal question, but how many of you out there are sexually active?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Does anyone know what we risk when we have unprotected sex?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but the truth is, the greatest risk you face is sexually transmitted diseases."
Leslie Knope,And the best way to prevent them is to use protection.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What happening?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Marcia and Marshall Langman are the town's morality watchdogs.
Leslie Knope,"Marcia is motivated, calculating, and hypervigilant, and her husband, Marshall, is vivacious."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's what I want."
Leslie Knope,It is not over.
Leslie Knope,It is far from over.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, pack up our bananas!"
Leslie Knope,"Look, we need an emergency task force meeting."
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,The people support this.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't fight those numbers even if I wanted to.
Leslie Knope,It's political suicide.
Leslie Knope,"There's no other option, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Put away your sex toys and play with them on your own time.
Leslie Knope,"""Chapter three."
Leslie Knope,"There's a party in your pants and no one is invited."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's the law."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,You want to go there?
Leslie Knope,You know where we're going.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I guess we're going there."
Leslie Knope,You want me to act like myself?
Leslie Knope,You're dressed like a cowboy!
Leslie Knope,"When you dated Andy, you dressed in flannels."
Leslie Knope,"When you dated Chris, you dressed in spandex."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, please do not lecture me about acting like myself."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you very much, Marshall."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, my aged friends."
Leslie Knope,Some of you might remember that I was here before.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was."
Leslie Knope,But I have a new message for you.
Leslie Knope,The best way to be safe is to simply postpone sex until marriage.
Leslie Knope,"Perhaps you might understand it better if I read to you from this pamphlet, So you think you know more than God."
Leslie Knope,"""Our bodies are God's gift, ""but they're also the devil's playground."
Leslie Knope,"""The devil likes to hide ""in all your private nooks and crannies, ""and if you open too wide, he might get out, or in."""
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wish I could, but I Oh, screw it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here."
Leslie Knope,"This is a penis, right?"
Leslie Knope,"You put a condom on it, and you pull the tip like this, and you roll it all the way down the penis."
Leslie Knope,"Tell you what, condoms for everybody!"
Leslie Knope,Who wants some?
Leslie Knope,Safe sex for everybody!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, who wants to party?"
Leslie Knope,It's a censure from the mayor's office.
Leslie Knope,It's so official.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at the paper quality."
Leslie Knope,This is no joke.
Leslie Knope,"I know I'm supposed to help educate the public, but I also have an obligation to uphold the laws."
Leslie Knope,You're my boss.
Leslie Knope,What's my move here?
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,Why am I still weirdly scared of you?
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I got censured, it's a big deal."
Leslie Knope,I feel terrible about what I said too.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but I still feel terrible."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, continue."
Leslie Knope,Yikes.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's good, but I'll tell you, he'll never lasso another heifer as fine as you, Annie Oakley."
Leslie Knope,It means that I have been formally disciplined for breaking the law.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what they say, ""You break it, you buy it."""
Leslie Knope,That doesn't really apply here.
Leslie Knope,"Tell that to the folks at Pier 1, an establishment I'm no longer allowed inside."
Leslie Knope,"Perd, I'd like to apologize."
Leslie Knope,Apologize for the antiquated laws in this city.
Leslie Knope,States that teach abstinence only have the highest rates of teen pregnancy and STDs.
Leslie Knope,To continue this policy is insane.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we all want the same thing, right? We want fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer STDs."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we use every weapon that we have? I know that most of you don't agree with me on this, but I'm going to fight very hard to change your minds, and until then, I will take this censure, and I will wear it proudly, like a badge of honor."
Leslie Knope,They're killing me in the press.
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Sun is calling me ""Loose-ly Grope."""
Leslie Knope,But you know what? I don't even care.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna kick all their asses! I am so fired up! I'm gonna go right now and drink, like, 1,000 Red Bulls so I can draft a new bill to undo abstinence only."
Leslie Knope,You're the greatest.
Leslie Knope,"But you're gonna have to take out a lot of cursing, 'cause like I said, I am very fired up."
Leslie Knope,I love you too.
Leslie Knope,What are you wearing?
Leslie Knope,"But no trampoline room, correct?"
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,Ben is coming back from D.C.
Leslie Knope,in ten days and he we are moving into a house together.
Leslie Knope,"He would move into my place, but it's a scary nightmare hoarder nest."
Leslie Knope,His words.
Leslie Knope,And Ann's.
Leslie Knope,And the official report filed by the Health Department.
Leslie Knope,I'm just so happy that Ben and I are starting our life together and my future's finally back on track.
Leslie Knope,"Martha, I wanna lease this house."
Leslie Knope,Thought it was gonna be more dramatic than that.
Leslie Knope,"Martha, I wanna lease this house."
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,The lady and you're the
Leslie Knope,Cool.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"So hold on, what does this mean?"
Leslie Knope,Florida?
Leslie Knope,They have sharks in Florida.
Leslie Knope,And swamps.
Leslie Knope,And swamp sharks.
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"Look, so are you gonna do it?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I just applied for a lease."
Leslie Knope,We were supposed to
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I just feel so powerless."
Leslie Knope,Just when things start to turn around and they fall apart.
Leslie Knope,Now I know exactly how FDR felt after Pearl Harbor.
Leslie Knope,That would cheer me up.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, God."
Leslie Knope,Gross.
Leslie Knope,Oh Jerry?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Are you serious?
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,So much stuff is happening right now.
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Jerry's having a heart attack.
Leslie Knope,"How is he, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Give it to me straight.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry, Jerry, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You are gonna have the future that you've always planned.
Leslie Knope,Just leave it to us.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I have arranged for the Parks Department to throw a huge garage sale fundraiser for Jerry to help pay for his hospital bills."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee municipal employee health care plan is kinda crappy.
Leslie Knope,One time I sprained my wrist and our insurance claimed that having a wrist was a preexisting condition.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,"As many of your know, Jerry Gergich, our friend, has suffered a devastating fart attack, and we are here to help."
Leslie Knope,So there are some special auction items I will be dealing with.
Leslie Knope,The first item up for bid is an inscribed autobiography from Pawnee newscaster Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,The book's entitled The Thing About Me Is I'm Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, let's start the bidding at 20 dollars."
Leslie Knope,20 dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you sir, for 20."
Leslie Knope,Do I see 30?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is our final auction item."
Leslie Knope,"It's a one of a kind autograph from mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we need some big bids Oh, excuse me one second."
Leslie Knope,"Um, can you just okay."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how was the meeting?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, you know, obviously you gotta take it, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Love you, too."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann, bad."
Leslie Knope,"You might not care about Jerry's future, but I do."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"We need to do something very drastic so he can be happy, so we can all be happy."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have a new item up for bid."
Leslie Knope,A wonderful surprise item.
Leslie Knope,An evening with sexy nurse Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Look at her, folks."
Leslie Knope,One evening with the most beautiful woman in the world.
Leslie Knope,"Just dinner and dancing, nothing sexual."
Leslie Knope,"Unless she's into that, but no, she's not."
Leslie Knope,Nothing fresh.
Leslie Knope,Don't even try it.
Leslie Knope,"But you never know, right?"
Leslie Knope,"No, she's not into it."
Leslie Knope,"Don't try anything, but, you know, give it a shot."
Leslie Knope,"Either way, it's for a good cause."
Leslie Knope,Let's raise some money.
Leslie Knope,"Please, we need to do this for Jerry and his future."
Leslie Knope,"This could be great, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Three out of four married couples have met each other at spontaneous auctions.
Leslie Knope,"I dwell, I don't know, I"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have a $100 bid for Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,200
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,200 for the smartest and most accomplished woman I know.
Leslie Knope,And check out that bod.
Leslie Knope,Can I get 3?
Leslie Knope,Uhoh.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, 900 from the man with the tank top and the tattoos."
Leslie Knope,That's so great.
Leslie Knope,"Let's beat that, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,Who wants to beat it?
Leslie Knope,Anybody beat it please?
Leslie Knope,"Okay Sir, what would you do with your 900 dollars date?"
Leslie Knope,"How would you, uh, um What are you gonna do to her?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's not as bad as I thought it would be."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Jerry, but your future has been canceled."
Leslie Knope,"We only raised 1,200 dollars."
Leslie Knope,"No, it stinks."
Leslie Knope,It's not even close to what you need.
Leslie Knope,"With all your bills, and the inevitable followup problems, and the lifetime of chronic misery that awaits you."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you had this whole plan for your retirement and your beach house and now you're future is just a huge pile of crap."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, your life is so depressing."
Leslie Knope,No thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, my boyfriend might not be moving back for a while so I have to back out."
Leslie Knope,Just wanted to look at it one more time.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"All right, Martha."
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, is there a way I could put down, like a"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I didn't know you were coming back here.
Leslie Knope,"What are you doing? Oh, my God, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Just I need to remember this.
Leslie Knope,Gimme a second.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, hold on."
Leslie Knope,"Just I need another second, please."
Leslie Knope,I need to remember every little thing about how perfect my life is right now at this exact moment.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm good.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,And it's a nonconflict diamond.
Leslie Knope,Let me start from the beginning.
Leslie Knope,"In 1832, Ben's great great great great grandfather, Teodore Wyatt, a bastard, met a beautiful seamstress from Antwerp."
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are getting married, and I've been telling everybody about it."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so happy, I want to shout it from the rooftops."
Leslie Knope,We're getting married!
Leslie Knope,Oh
Leslie Knope,"Hey, everyone!"
Leslie Knope,We have something very exciting to tell you that you have never heard before.
Leslie Knope,Ben and I are engaged
Leslie Knope,And you're hearing about it for the very first time right now.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tminus six hours until the engagement party."
Leslie Knope,Has you know who responded yet?
Leslie Knope,"Well, he kind of waits until the last minute."
Leslie Knope,That's his style.
Leslie Knope,"Put him down as a ""maybe."""
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Leslie Knope,"No to canceling the party, and no to Twizzlers."
Leslie Knope,We are a Red Vines family.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna have to get used to that.
Leslie Knope,"I know you're scared, but I love you, and this party is gonna go great."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,Let's go over the plan.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Your mom arrives at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,"We hand her a glass of chilled white wine, and, oh, look, my mom is walking over, and they're both educators and mothers."
Leslie Knope,What a fabulous coincidence.
Leslie Knope,"Then later, Stephen Wyatt shows up that's your dad."
Leslie Knope,"We make some small talk, and 30 minutes later, I show everybody the big surprise."
Leslie Knope,The Knope Wyatt unity quilt.
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are weaving our lives together, so I have woven this quilt."
Leslie Knope,It represents every member of our new united family.
Leslie Knope,"Of all my metaphorical art projects, this is by far the coziest."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I worked really hard on it.
Leslie Knope,"And, out of respect, I did not include any images of the only other man in the world who's as sexy as you, Joe Biden."
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, that's just a little one."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, this quilt is going to unite the Wyatt clan."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, your mom's here."
Leslie Knope,I need you.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"It'sit's really nice to finally meet you, Ms."
Leslie Knope,Wyatt.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I have some white wine for you, some Chardonnay."
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,Right this way.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"And I said, rules or no rules, I just have to kiss that beautiful face."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"So far, so good."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He brought his girlfriend?
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't supposed to bring his girlfriend, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"Ulani, hi, I'm Leslie."
Leslie Knope,What a wonderful surprise.
Leslie Knope,We're so happy that you're here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Red Vines anyone?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are off to a rocky start, but we are gonna fix this."
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to be here now, with you and your parents."
Leslie Knope,Help me make this work.
Leslie Knope,"Great, like what?"
Leslie Knope,"Uh, slight speed bump."
Leslie Knope,"Everything is terrible, but I am going to fix it with my secret weapon."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you are such a good friend."
Leslie Knope,"You are a beautiful, talented, brilliant, powerful musk ox."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ox, for keeping this ship afloat."
Leslie Knope,"Steve, you like sailing, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least you don't have to deal with all that boat upkeep now, right, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Yech, no thankee."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about something other than sailing.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you head in the other room?
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise that there she goes.
Leslie Knope,"There's a surprise for you, so, um, head on in."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, on three separate occasions, I have used a quilt to mend fences."
Leslie Knope,"In ninth grade, a quilt ended an argument between my two best friends, and a quilt settled the Donna Jerry parking lot feud of 2006."
Leslie Knope,Right [Bleep] now.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, I have a surprise for all of you."
Leslie Knope,Voila!
Leslie Knope,The Knope Wyatt unity quilt!
Leslie Knope,"It represents our two families coming together, and there is a personalized square for each member of our joint family, see?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're not technically"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I will make an Ulani square.
Leslie Knope,"Very, very easy."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is your square now."
Leslie Knope,"What does ""Ulani"" mean?"
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,Unity!
Leslie Knope,It's that simple.
Leslie Knope,All we had to do was
Leslie Knope,It's not your it's everyone's quilt.
Leslie Knope,It's a unity quilt.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben, they're agreeing."
Leslie Knope,It's working.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, why don't we just forget about the quilt and just raise a glass?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's so brutal!"
Leslie Knope,Were you and Dad ever like that?
Leslie Knope,La la la la la.
Leslie Knope,How can you be so wise and so inappropriate at the same time?
Leslie Knope,I grabbed all of the brownies from the dessert table and four bottles of wine.
Leslie Knope,Get in the car.
Leslie Knope,We're going to Australia.
Leslie Knope,I am so sorry for everything.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and I want to be on your team."
Leslie Knope,"I am on your team, but I think that our team should be far away from here."
Leslie Knope,It was a good quilt.
Leslie Knope,I agree.
Leslie Knope,"Phase one of our new plan, you get in the backseat of this cab, and we hardcore make out for 15 minutes."
Leslie Knope,But it did not work out that way.
Leslie Knope,So here is the new plan.
Leslie Knope,"I don't expect you to like each other, but you have to come to the wedding, okay? We'll seat you far away from each other."
Leslie Knope,You don't even have to socialize.
Leslie Knope,"Ben's parents are insane, but he is not."
Leslie Knope,He's amazing.
Leslie Knope,And that's all that matters.
Leslie Knope,I guess he might become insane as he ages.
Leslie Knope,I should keep an eye out for that.
Leslie Knope,"Also, for the record, my unity quilt worked."
Leslie Knope,"So technically, I am three for three with unity quilts."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Get ready, driver."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna make out so hard in the back of your cab.
Leslie Knope,2020
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"I win, we move in there."
Leslie Knope,I'll take the West Wing.
Leslie Knope,You take the East Wing.
Leslie Knope,You can be the first gentleman.
Leslie Knope,How could I pass up an opportunity to look at our future house?
Leslie Knope,Is it a waffle tower?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, that how did How did you do this?"
Leslie Knope,You're my name just came out of your mouth.
Leslie Knope,This isn't happening.
Leslie Knope,This isn't real.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. vice president, I am deeply flattered, but there's no way that I could take over Madam Secretary Clinton's position."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I will."
Leslie Knope,And I just want to say thank you.
Leslie Knope,You're very handsome.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope,We'll see you tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"You don't let anything happen to him, you understand me?"
Leslie Knope,He is precious cargo.
Leslie Knope,"Can you say ""per capita"" again?"
Leslie Knope,"I want to take a picture of you saying ""per capita."""
Leslie Knope,I am so proud of you.
Leslie Knope,Now stand next to the screen and think about all the strong female role models in your life.
Leslie Knope,April came to me with an idea to build a dog park in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"I recognized her potential a long time ago, and she's finally living up to it."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I am so proud of her, I could cry."
Leslie Knope,And here we go.
Leslie Knope,One tiny critique.
Leslie Knope,"If you do want to be taken seriously, you might want to think a little bit about how you present yourself."
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, that's horrifying, and so is Orin."
Leslie Knope,You should not be friends with him.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,I've been trying to put a park there for four years.
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, April, that lot is mine."
Leslie Knope,"I've been doing slow, painstaking work so I don't want to whip out the legalese on you now, but I got dibs."
Leslie Knope,"What we are gonna do is we're gonna take your enthusiasm, we're gonna bundle it up, and we're gonna find a new place for a dog park."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't that sound fun?
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, cheese."
Leslie Knope,Good girl.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think any of the four previous locations would work, but there's something about this place."
Leslie Knope,"It just has a really good energy here, you know?"
Leslie Knope,lots of natural light.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, this is a great place for a dog park."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, there's already a dog here."
Leslie Knope,"April, please, I beg of you, I will do anything to keep you from doing that."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I have created a monster.
Leslie Knope,And now I need to destroy her.
Leslie Knope,"What do I do, Joe?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie, look into my eyes, take a deep breath, and everything will be fine."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"God, he's good."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for agreeing to see me."
Leslie Knope,I don't have time for a history lesson.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am trying to remove parking meters, and there is a guy in Public Works who's being a real thorn about it."
Leslie Knope,Ricky Jordache.
Leslie Knope,He's new.
Leslie Knope,"He used to be a slacker, but now he's realizing his full potential, but at what cost?"
Leslie Knope,"He's smart, and he's beautiful, and I think of him in many ways as a daughter, but that would be crazy 'cause he's a man and his name's Ricky."
Leslie Knope,Here's my question.
Leslie Knope,How did you used to slow me down when I was becoming too meish?
Leslie Knope,That soil brochure was not busy work.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, people still refer to Mulch Ado About Nothing."
Leslie Knope,Those were distraction waffles?
Leslie Knope,I thought they were friendship waffles.
Leslie Knope,"But what if this person, this Ricky, who is real, doesn't like waffles or anything."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is really, really cool."
Leslie Knope,"I like the statement it's making that, you know, we're all in cages in a way."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I see that now.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Orin."
Leslie Knope,I think we should do more stuff like this.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think Pawnee needs an amazing arts program."
Leslie Knope,Maybe you should just drop everything and coordinate it.
Leslie Knope,What is that supposed to mean?
Leslie Knope,I love this show.
Leslie Knope,The heavy handedness.
Leslie Knope,Why are you talking to Councilman Jamm?
Leslie Knope,"Our dispute aside, you should be careful with Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"He's a snake, I'm telling you."
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,Aren't you supposed to be a sheep?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shut up."
Leslie Knope,Boo.
Leslie Knope,Boo.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it sounds like there's considerable opposition to this, so I'm sorry, Ms. Ludgate, you should go now."
Leslie Knope,I hate when he says that.
Leslie Knope,I told you that Jamm was a snake.
Leslie Knope,So now I'm a snake?
Leslie Knope,I don't eat mice.
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I ever wanted was for you to show the enthusiasm you showed for your dog park, and, when you did, I blew it."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very, very sorry."
Leslie Knope,I love you very much.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"It's very uncool, but it's not illegal, technically, but it is a dick move."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,"The dogs are here because there's no dog park in your neighborhood, and the kids are here because there's no human park in your area."
Leslie Knope,They all needed a place to play.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, we just need a little bit more time to design our park."
Leslie Knope,"And, if you plow through and ignore us, this is gonna be your life."
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,You just got knoped.
Leslie Knope,And ludgated.
Leslie Knope,And perkinsed.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's get to work."
Leslie Knope,"I just said, ""let's get to work."""
Leslie Knope,How else do people enjoy things?
Leslie Knope,"It is a pleasure to be back, Derry."
Leslie Knope,Your show last week on dolphin lactation was just riveting radio.
Leslie Knope,"Derry, my team and I are trying to build a park, and we need input on the design from you, the citizens of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,So I guess I'm here to send out the Bat Signal.
Leslie Knope,That's correct.
Leslie Knope,Well put.
Leslie Knope,This park is going to be a celebration of Pawnee by Pawnee and for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, send in your plan or your resume And quick."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Hurry.
Leslie Knope,This is all gonna fall apart if you don't hurry.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"""Now it's time for 'Jazz Plus Jazz Equals Jazz, ' ""today we have a recording of Benny Goodman played over a separate recording of Miles Davis."""
Leslie Knope,"All right, so this is a letter from what looks like a federal penitentiary."
Leslie Knope,"""Here's a model of what I thought the park could look like."
Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm innocent."
Leslie Knope,"Please find me a lawyer."""
Leslie Knope,I'm getting kind of worried.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we have not received one usable idea so far."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Beautiful fountain.
Leslie Knope,Perfectly manicured shrubbery.
Leslie Knope,This is like Parks Department porn.
Leslie Knope,This guy is great.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if he's some junkie war criminal pimp.
Leslie Knope,I am not gonna change my mind.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I've changed my mind."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not being melodramatic when I say that people from Eagleton are snobby and evil, and they look down on Pawnee, and they would most likely exterminate everyone who isn't from Eagleton if they weren't so busy being obsessed with themselves."
Leslie Knope,"God, that was close."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes when I rant about Eagleton, I forget to breathe, and I pass out."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We cannot have someone from Eagleton design a park for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We have had a blood feud that has lasted for 200 years.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,Then we can reject him face to face.
Leslie Knope,I like your plan.
Leslie Knope,He designed this place?
Leslie Knope,What a dump.
Leslie Knope,Eh.
Leslie Knope,"In a word, underwhelming."
Leslie Knope,And a little inconvenient.
Leslie Knope,There's no trash cans anywhere.
Leslie Knope,"What am I supposed to do with my garbage, just throw it on the ground?"
Leslie Knope,It's so boring.
Leslie Knope,He seems cool.
Leslie Knope,Just you wait.
Leslie Knope,"Well, they always wine and dine you first, but the fact of the matter is Eagletonians are, without exception, snobby, condescending jerks."
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee side of our border with Eagleton And this is the Eagleton side.
Leslie Knope,We totally fixed it.
Leslie Knope,Can we just cut to the chase here?
Leslie Knope,Why would a fancy Eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny Pawnee park?
Leslie Knope,Why are you so charmed by him?
Leslie Knope,You're like a Southern belle when Rhett Butler comes around.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No one from Eagleton has ever wanted to help anyone from Pawnee for any reason.
Leslie Knope,"In 1988, we were hit by a tornado."
Leslie Knope,"We asked Eagleton for help, and they claimed they weren't home."
Leslie Knope,An entire town claimed they weren't home.
Leslie Knope,I don't trust that guy for a second.
Leslie Knope,"May, 1817."
Leslie Knope,"A scrappy group of frontiersmen and women arrive at a hardscrabble chunk of land and call it Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"June, 1817, the richest among them take all of their money from the bank and then flee up the hill like cowards to form Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,Recognize any of your ancestors among the meanies?
Leslie Knope,Do not blame me for the sins of my mother.
Leslie Knope,Oh running away so soon.
Leslie Knope,Typical.
Leslie Knope,"You know, say what you want about Pawneeans, but we never give up."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look who's paying attention to me now!"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Idi Amin.
Leslie Knope,Or Lord Voldemort.
Leslie Knope,Ha ha ha.
Leslie Knope,"You are a laugh riot, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I am never going to apologize to someone from Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to.
Leslie Knope,"I may have allowed my prejudices, my totally legitimate prejudices against Eagleton affect my feelings towards your involvement in this project, and so therefore, I would like to say that I'm I'm I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's not what I want to say.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,My mouth is kinda dry.
Leslie Knope,My mouth is dry.
Leslie Knope,This is Canada Dry.
Leslie Knope,Drink Canada Dry if your mouth is dry.
Leslie Knope,That's nothing.
Leslie Knope,What I want to say is I'm s I'm sor I'm sor
Leslie Knope,He's a human being.
Leslie Knope,You're a human being.
Leslie Knope,You can just just say I'm sor
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that I I'm sorry, very sorry, that I was rude."
Leslie Knope,It's too soon.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That's very nice of you.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Where's Wreston?
Leslie Knope,You have five seconds to get out of here Or I will rip your throats out.
Leslie Knope,"I told you that Eagletonians are awful, terrible people."
Leslie Knope,They call their boogers Pawnee caviar.
Leslie Knope,Any excuse to talk to Wreston.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am gonna think about a revenge plan."
Leslie Knope,I know what we're gonna do.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna find out where he lives.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna drive to his house.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna set it on fire and watch it burn.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,We can't.
Leslie Knope,"Revenge! Ha ha hal This is for Pawnee, you buttfaced pompous jerk! Whoo! I love you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee forever! You want a stupid tie? I'll give you a stupid tie.
Leslie Knope,"Ha ha! Wreston, suck it."
Leslie Knope,Now we're even.
Leslie Knope,"A Wamapoke themed playground Food trucks from local restaurants, Li'l Sebastian fountain."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's perfect."
Leslie Knope,I can't see myself fighting you on more than 60% of these ideas.
Leslie Knope,Me.
Leslie Knope,He's in love with me.
Leslie Knope,Merry CongratuChristmas!
Leslie Knope,"Half ""Merry Christmas,"" half ""Congratulations,"" because I just received some news."
Leslie Knope,"You, Ron Swanson, have been nominated for an award from the Indiana Fine Woodworking Association."
Leslie Knope,"I've had a ""Ron Swanson"" Google alert for seven years and it finally paid off."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I love events!"
Leslie Knope,I can't wait to go tonight.
Leslie Knope,"As your selfappointed emotional guardian, it is my duty to love and support you."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you know, this is a big deal."
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't be there alone.
Leslie Knope,Even better.
Leslie Knope,I am very excited to meet Diane.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I forgot to sing you my merry CongratuChristmas carol."
Leslie Knope,"Jingle bells, jingle yay, jingle good for you"
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Diane, wow."
Leslie Knope,"Ron has told me so much about you, in that he has told me your name is Diane, and you exist."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's Ulysses."
Leslie Knope,"So tell me everything about yourself: Your kids, your hobbies."
Leslie Knope,"What are your five biggest hopes, dreams, fears, and regrets?"
Leslie Knope,"I know you didn't, but if you had gone to Hogwarts Academy, which House do you think you would have been?"
Leslie Knope,I respect your honesty.
Leslie Knope,Gryffindor.
Leslie Knope,Seeker on the Quidditch team.
Leslie Knope,Which one is Ron's?
Leslie Knope,"Smart, funny, independent, and sexy?"
Leslie Knope,Diane Lewis?
Leslie Knope,More like Diane Sawyer.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, guess why my thumbs are up."
Leslie Knope,Because I'm giving you my 100% approval about Diane.
Leslie Knope,She is perfect for you.
Leslie Knope,She gets you.
Leslie Knope,"She is at the bar right now ordering a Lagavulin, neat for you."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, she's even putting up with all this stupid, boring woodworking stuff."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but, you know, it's not the Super Bowl, guys."
Leslie Knope,Let's take it down a notch.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, you have my approval."
Leslie Knope,But you have it.
Leslie Knope,But you got it.
Leslie Knope,This could end up being the best night in Ron Swanson's life.
Leslie Knope,"I am so, so happy for him"
Leslie Knope,[Bleep] me!
Leslie Knope,"Alert alert, alert, alert."
Leslie Knope,And divorced twice.
Leslie Knope,Everything is done.
Leslie Knope,They are totally done.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,Can I speak with you for a moment?
Leslie Knope,"Everything's fine, we're just gonna chat."
Leslie Knope,"Shouldn't you be at the library, forcing people to borrow books?"
Leslie Knope,Of course it does.
Leslie Knope,So you can ruin his life?
Leslie Knope,"This may be the hardest challenge yet for Leslie Knope, emotional guardian."
Leslie Knope,"I need to protect a sweet couple from a sex crazed demon librarian who makes me question my stance on using the ""B"" word."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, maybe just this once."
Leslie Knope,"No, Leslie, fight it."
Leslie Knope,Fight it.
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, this table is reserved."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, this is your moment."
Leslie Knope,Tune her out.
Leslie Knope,She's not even here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow!"
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Diane ugh.
Leslie Knope,The stuff with Tammy is so complex and weird and gross.
Leslie Knope,It just would probably be better if you let me handle it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,You who?
Leslie Knope,You me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Diane, you misunderstand."
Leslie Knope,I'm happily engaged.
Leslie Knope,She left.
Leslie Knope,"No, she left because of me."
Leslie Knope,She's threatened by our relationship.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, one man's ""worst nightmare"" is every other man's ""total package."""
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, I don't think it's about dating."
Leslie Knope,I kind of see where Diane is coming from.
Leslie Knope,"We are close friends, and I'm very involved in your life."
Leslie Knope,"By Swanson standards, we're close."
Leslie Knope,I know when your birthday is.
Leslie Knope,I know that you secretly love artichokes and plums.
Leslie Knope,"I think you should take my car and go get Diane, and I will handle Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Good to know.
Leslie Knope,"Too late, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Ron's gone.
Leslie Knope,You'll never get him back.
Leslie Knope,"Few hours, you say?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Never! Hey, game over, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,You are so crazy!
Leslie Knope,No! No!
Leslie Knope,Come back here Ow! You are not gonna ruin this night!
Leslie Knope,"Ha! You're too late! No! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,I think it's time to officially retire as Ron's emotional guardian.
Leslie Knope,"That's Diane's job now, and she seems more than up to the task."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'd do anything for Ron even spend a whole night fighting his crazy ex-wife."
Leslie Knope,But I think I'm safe.
Leslie Knope,She's gotta be tired by now.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Help.
Leslie Knope,He's funny.
Leslie Knope,This guy's funny.
Leslie Knope,He does that sometimes.
Leslie Knope,"Ken Hotate is the leader of the Wamapoke people, and we are trying to get them involved in our Pawnee Commons project."
Leslie Knope,Ken and I get along great.
Leslie Knope,"But historically, Pawnee's relationship with the Wamapoke has been more Murdery."
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think we are.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if we could put that in a public park.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Ohhh!
Leslie Knope,What are you losers doing for your bachelor party?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What the hell?
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, what the hell are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, the deal was that both of us had three months to get our proposals together, and then we put it up for a vote."
Leslie Knope,We still have two weeks left.
Leslie Knope,"Well, four years of work down the drain, and I have a penis on my head."
Leslie Knope,Jamm is stealing this lot right out from under us.
Leslie Knope,"My dream is dead, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I know, Ann, but everything's gonna disappear."
Leslie Knope,"April's mini dog park, the Li'l Sebastian fountain, even the Wamapoke playground."
Leslie Knope,Yet another piece of Wamapoke land plowed over by the white man.
Leslie Knope,"For almost 200 years, Pawnee repeatedly built factories, restaurants, and other stuff on land held sacred by the Wamapoke people."
Leslie Knope,"So we passed a law saying that if any sacred Wamapoke artifact is found on a development site, all construction must immediately stop."
Leslie Knope,It would be terrible if that were to happen on this future Paunch Burger site.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is bad."
Leslie Knope,I should not have done this.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ann, not now."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And we're gonna have to stop now.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood for historical nudity."
Leslie Knope,"Please, Mr. president, put your pants back on."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, can I speak with you privately?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I buried a bunch of Wamapoke artifacts in the dirt so that people would find them and have to stop developing at the site."
Leslie Knope,"You know, when I say it out loud, it doesn't sound so bad."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm was being sneaky, and then I tried to sneaky him back, and it turned to crummy, and I have to undo it."
Leslie Knope,I need your help.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, please."
Leslie Knope,"Take extra cream, 30 sugars."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I tried to exploit the Wamapoke for my own personal gain.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Tweep.
Leslie Knope,I tweeped.
Leslie Knope,I called Tweep.
Leslie Knope,Shauna MalwaeTweep.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm so glad that you're here."
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Nothing?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,He's gonna be so mad.
Leslie Knope,The zodiac killer never confessed.
Leslie Knope,Why do I have to?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, April, I wish you weren't right, but you are."
Leslie Knope,"You have turned into a very beautiful, wise, and fertile government employee."
Leslie Knope,"In 1921, several Wamapoke families were removed from their homes so that Pawnee could install a bumper car track."
Leslie Knope,"In 1951, Pawnee made it illegal for people to, ""Dance or smell like a native American."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, I want to raise the bar of awfulness so that when I confess something to you, you have perspective."
Leslie Knope,Those artifacts found at lot 48 were placed there by me.
Leslie Knope,I wanted to delay construction on the Paunch Burger and buy some more time for my park project.
Leslie Knope,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very, very sorry."
Leslie Knope,I have great respect for the Wamapoke culture.
Leslie Knope,And this isn't even about the Pawnee Commons.
Leslie Knope,"I just hope that you can forgive me, Ken."
Leslie Knope,There's something else.
Leslie Knope,I would like to go on record and say that
Leslie Knope,He really plays white people like a fiddle.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,It's amazing to watch.
Leslie Knope,"In the spirit of fair play, I suggest we put on these authentic Wamapoke headdresses and dance around the table."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we do."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you are such an inspiration."
Leslie Knope,Still going strong at 82.
Leslie Knope,Paula Horke was Pawnee's first female city councilor a huge inspiration to me.
Leslie Knope,"Women have come a long way in Pawnee, but we still have quite a ways to go."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, technically, I'm not allowed to reserve this conference room without my husband or father's signature."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am happy to report that it is now a pervert free people's club."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, things aren't perfect."
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,That is horrible.
Leslie Knope,They don't do that to me.
Leslie Knope,Do they do that to me?
Leslie Knope,Man pigs.
Leslie Knope,All of them.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, I'm gonna get that commission going, because this inequality has gone on long enough."
Leslie Knope,She's kidding.
Leslie Knope,"April, stop it."
Leslie Knope,She ugh.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I didn't know where you were going with that.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,That's what you're calling her now.
Leslie Knope,So the commission?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're kidding me.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Did anyone notice that there are no women on the Gender Equality Commission?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, okay, we are gonna need to rebalance this commission."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Councilman Milton, I did put the snacks together, and they are delicious, I must say, but that is not the point."
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,This is my commission!
Leslie Knope,Is it possible you're thinking about light bulbs?
Leslie Knope,Or your hip?
Leslie Knope,"Incoherent ramblings aside, I've done some research, and the female employment rate in government is abysmal."
Leslie Knope,The number one offender: Sanitation.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, stop celebrating."
Leslie Knope,"Why are there no female garbage collectors, Steve?"
Leslie Knope,"You have one woman, and she's a secretary."
Leslie Knope,"Garbage collectors make good wages, they have good benefits, and they are the smelly glue that keeps this city together."
Leslie Knope,You need to hire more women.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I took extensive notes on ways to maximize our efficiency, because we can't be just as good as the men."
Leslie Knope,We have to be better.
Leslie Knope,"April, I love you, but I don't need your sarcasm right now."
Leslie Knope,"Actually, yeah."
Leslie Knope,That's what's in the binder on every page because I believe in being thorough.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's weird."
Leslie Knope,"You know, with us being women and all, you'd think our boobs would get in the way."
Leslie Knope,Tough stuff.
Leslie Knope,Google Earth Always taking pics.
Leslie Knope,Let's move it out!
Leslie Knope,A new challenge?
Leslie Knope,"Bring it on, Stevie boy."
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"April, let's finish up!"
Leslie Knope,We have some stereotypes to overcome.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, easy, breezy, beautiful."
Leslie Knope,That's the covergirl slogan.
Leslie Knope,I didn't mean to say that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,On three!
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, move it."
Leslie Knope,"On four, five, six, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, we don't need a hand."
Leslie Knope,"What, you think Joan of Arc needed a hand?"
Leslie Knope,Let me tell you something.
Leslie Knope,"We are not leaving until this symbolic feminist obstacle is loaded onto that truck of women's advancement, and you can put that on the record, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,Not at all.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Shauna, maybe not put this part on the record."
Leslie Knope,"You know, leave the earlier part on the record, but if we can't get this fridge onto the truck then maybe not put that on the record, and then just destroy the record altogether."
Leslie Knope,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,The whole city is watching.
Leslie Knope,"If I can't move that fridge onto that truck, then feminism is over in this town."
Leslie Knope,I don't know why I thought sneaking up on it would work.
Leslie Knope,"We have to solve this problem, or they are going to point to this forever as a reason to not hire women."
Leslie Knope,I should never have taken the bait.
Leslie Knope,"It was just such tasty, righteously flavored bait."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are."
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,"No, I understand animal sizes."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean they couldn't lift it?
Leslie Knope,Those Sanitation goons set us up.
Leslie Knope,You know what? Let's just go.
Leslie Knope,Just call it a tie.
Leslie Knope,Nobody can lift it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hold on."
Leslie Knope,Sir! Does this refrigerator still work?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's pretty good, right? ""Personal relationship."""
Leslie Knope,"I know you're not used to this, but maybe you should just try to keep it chill and see what happens."
Leslie Knope,"So do you think the soup kitchen could use that fridge? I mean, April and I were gonna haul it onto the truck effortlessly, but if you need it"
Leslie Knope,"Not only did we complete the garbage route and move an unmovable fridge, but the Sanitation department hired three new female trash haulers."
Leslie Knope,"And, best of all, April gave me this present to commemorate our feminist victory."
Leslie Knope,And it's trash.
Leslie Knope,It's filled with trash.
Leslie Knope,Maybe there's something on the bottom here.
Leslie Knope,"Let me see, No, just trash."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so fine with it, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Seriously.
Leslie Knope,It's so fine.
Leslie Knope,As long as you and I are cool.
Leslie Knope,You know my code.
Leslie Knope,Hoes before bros.
Leslie Knope,Uteruses before duderuses.
Leslie Knope,Ovaries before brovaries.
Leslie Knope,You make such good coffee.
Leslie Knope,"But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex."
Leslie Knope,"You know, we slept together six years ago."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm over it."
Leslie Knope,Or am I?
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.
Leslie Knope,This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
Leslie Knope,"A community garden, right in the middle of the pit."
Leslie Knope,We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.
Leslie Knope,And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
Leslie Knope,People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
Leslie Knope,And Tom is our master horticulturist.
Leslie Knope,He knows all the scientific names for everything.
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,Like this.
Leslie Knope,"What's this, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,And those over there?
Leslie Knope,Growing beautifully.
Leslie Knope,"Look, someone planted something new."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Leslie Knope,"What do you think, carrots?"
Leslie Knope,"If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands."
Leslie Knope,Maybe some kind of spice?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, did you get my texts?"
Leslie Knope,Did you get my emails?
Leslie Knope,Did you see that I paged you?
Leslie Knope,Did you check your voicemail?
Leslie Knope,We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Leslie Knope,Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Leslie Knope,That'll leak to the press.
Leslie Knope,"Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding."
Leslie Knope,And we never will if this gets out.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"And listen, if this thing blows up, I was never here."
Leslie Knope,We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Leslie Knope,Who is this person?
Leslie Knope,Who is this kingpin?
Leslie Knope,"I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana."
Leslie Knope,I ate a brownie once.
Leslie Knope,At a party in college.
Leslie Knope,It was intense.
Leslie Knope,"It was kind of indescribable, actually."
Leslie Knope,I felt like I was floating.
Leslie Knope,Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.
Leslie Knope,It was just an insanely good brownie.
Leslie Knope,"You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal."
Leslie Knope,"Cause we flip the headline, and it's not ""Community Garden Infested With Pot."""
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs, Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone."""
Leslie Knope,We got to catch this guy.
Leslie Knope,"Get the van, meet me at 7:00."
Leslie Knope,It's stakeout time.
Leslie Knope,I have stakeout supplies.
Leslie Knope,This is stuff that we're probably going to need.
Leslie Knope,"We have notepads, pencils and pencil case."
Leslie Knope,Shakable whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,Cameras.
Leslie Knope,Gorp.
Leslie Knope,And candy necklaces.
Leslie Knope,It's like we're real police.
Leslie Knope,And I made us a mix CD.
Leslie Knope,It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
Leslie Knope,It's mostly Sting.
Leslie Knope,"And look, I put our faces on there."
Leslie Knope,Are you going to wear that shirt?
Leslie Knope,Tommy Hilfiger?
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here."
Leslie Knope,You should be wearing something like this.
Leslie Knope,Take this.
Leslie Knope,Wear black.
Leslie Knope,Black is what you wear on a stakeout.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have to figure out how this works."
Leslie Knope,Just let me focus up on this.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes."
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look."
Leslie Knope,It's Mark.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Her name's Ann.
Leslie Knope,You know her name.
Leslie Knope,Her name's Ann.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I did."
Leslie Knope,"We were drunk, and he tried to kiss me, and I said, ""No, sir, Mark Brendanawicz."""
Leslie Knope,"""I don't need your business here."""
Leslie Knope,Get down.
Leslie Knope,"Shovel guitar, shovel guitar Somebody wants to play shovel guitar"
Leslie Knope,"Bucket drum, bucket drum You're not from here, right?"
Leslie Knope,But you moved to South Carolina from where?
Leslie Knope,"But you were conceived in Libya, right?"
Leslie Knope,Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?
Leslie Knope,What about Barack Obama?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, did you hear that noise?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's the kingpin!
Leslie Knope,Write this down.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, white male, light brown hair."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, it looks like Andy."
Leslie Knope,That is Andy.
Leslie Knope,Andy is the kingpin.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Come here.
Leslie Knope,Quietly.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's our community garden."
Leslie Knope,"Right, I know."
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,"Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?"
Leslie Knope,So why don't you come to the van and help us?
Leslie Knope,We're trying to catch the guy.
Leslie Knope,And maybe you could tell us what you've seen.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Ann is great.
Leslie Knope,And I bet she really misses you.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to need more of these if I'm going to stay up tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's a necklace, made out of candy."
Leslie Knope,You want one?
Leslie Knope,"You know, there's a string in there."
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should get you something more substantial to eat.
Leslie Knope,"So, Andy, do you, like, spy on Ann from the pit?"
Leslie Knope,I don't really know how healthy that is.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you guys aren't even dating anymore."
Leslie Knope,She might be dating somebody else.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I didn't say that.
Leslie Knope,Nobody.
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"If you could just stop writing for a second, and just focus here, because--"
Leslie Knope,"Well, it doesn't seem to matter to the police!"
Leslie Knope,Let me ask you a question.
Leslie Knope,Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'd like to come with you.
Leslie Knope,"Your name's Dave, right? Can I call you Dave?"
Leslie Knope,"Hate to break it to you, Dave."
Leslie Knope,You really stepped in it.
Leslie Knope,"I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner."
Leslie Knope,"If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's right."
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,Parks and Recreation.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Do I stutter?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk."
Leslie Knope,It's just--
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look."
Leslie Knope,Tom and I were in that van together.
Leslie Knope,"We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it."
Leslie Knope,"I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy."
Leslie Knope,I took the pictures.
Leslie Knope,My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
Leslie Knope,It's been a very long night.
Leslie Knope,"But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail."
Leslie Knope,"Well, they're going to release him in a little while."
Leslie Knope,"You know, you two go ahead."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, prison changes a man."
Leslie Knope,I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Leslie Knope,"Mother Teresa, it's not your chocolate."
Leslie Knope,Don't-- Get your hands off that.
Leslie Knope,What? Is this your house? Where are we?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for the coat.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And we'll talk about the coat.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's down in the garden.
Leslie Knope,I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.
Leslie Knope,"That's all that matters, you know? That Ann is home and she's okay."
Leslie Knope,And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.
Leslie Knope,Just important that they're both in their homes--
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"I swear to God, it actually-- It was there"
Leslie Knope,Duh! You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, I did not."
Leslie Knope,There actually was weed here
Leslie Knope,What a crazy night.
Leslie Knope,"Huh, partner? Want to go get some breakfast?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on."
Leslie Knope,I wonder if mini golf is open.
Leslie Knope,"Now I have two best friends, Ann and Ann."
Leslie Knope,Each one more beautiful than the other.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I have an idea for your blog."
Leslie Knope,I think you should take yourself iceskating.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll do a double date: You and you, and me and Ben."
Leslie Knope,"But I have to warn you, I'm very good at iceskating."
Leslie Knope,I can do jumps.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,I probably shouldn't come.
Leslie Knope,I'll embarrass the both of you.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, today?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you know that I fully support any woman's decision especially a beautiful unicorn nurse like yourself in creating the family that she wants."
Leslie Knope,But you are so brilliant and kind and stupid hot.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're definitely gonna find a wonderful guy who loves you and respects you and fills your home with multiethnic genius babies."
Leslie Knope,Ann is giving up on love and deciding to have a baby with herself.
Leslie Knope,And she has only been dating herself for six weeks.
Leslie Knope,"If she were dating a guy for six weeks, and they decided to have a kid, I'd be like, ""Congratulations, Ann And Channing Tatum."""
Leslie Knope,Because that is the only scenario that would make sense to me.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Tragically, we are both heterosexual."
Leslie Knope,So did the Unabomber.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so did Lance Armstrong, and he turned out to be a lying drug user."
Leslie Knope,Or a hero.
Leslie Knope,I don't know where we stand on him now.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, Sewage Joe."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you remember Joe Fantringham."
Leslie Knope,He is the gentleman who was fired for emailing a picture of his penis to every woman in city hall.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you are a donor here, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Did you hear that, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Shall we?
Leslie Knope,"Um, you don't want a demon baby."
Leslie Knope,"Look, you're Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,Sperm that is worthy of your perfect eggs does not grow on trees.
Leslie Knope,"I think, ideally, you'd want to know the guy, right?"
Leslie Knope,"You'd want to know his personality, his favorite season of Friends, whether or not he hates jazz hopefully, he does."
Leslie Knope,You'd want to know him.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"If I don't slow this baby train down, Ann may end up having a baby with some random weirdo instead of her soul mate."
Leslie Knope,I fully believe that a woman should be in charge of what happens to her body.
Leslie Knope,"In this case, the body is Ann's, and the woman in charge of it is me."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, how did you come up with these three names?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there he is."
Leslie Knope,"Actually, maybe you should check in on your patient."
Leslie Knope,I know that I hate it when my doctor makes me wait.
Leslie Knope,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That son of a bitch is astute.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all I need to do is just shoot one more person down and then I can buy some time and convince Ann to wait for her own Ben level soul mate."
Leslie Knope,The last guy is Howard Tuttleman.
Leslie Knope,I know that name.
Leslie Knope,How do I know that name?
Leslie Knope,"Then you became a morning shockjock and created the sport ""taint ball""?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think, you probably need to get back to the studio, play some fart jokes, make fun of some immigrants."
Leslie Knope,Gross.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's not gonna work."
Leslie Knope,Back to the drawing board.
Leslie Knope,You want to have a baby with the douche?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you cannot be serious."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Douche!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, douche!"
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, Ann is not interviewing you for her blog."
Leslie Knope,"She's thinking about having a baby, and she's considering you as a possible donor."
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I don't think you would be the right man for the job."
Leslie Knope,My God.
Leslie Knope,I have driven Ann right into the belly of the douche.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what's up?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You should be angry.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe Howard did that to you.
Leslie Knope,Because I thought you were making a huge mistake.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I get it."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're frustrated with dating, and you think you're not gonna meet someone, but two years ago, I didn't think I would meet someone like Ben, and I did."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do we have a meeting?"
Leslie Knope,That was not me.
Leslie Knope,That was a farcical sound effect.
Leslie Knope,"God, how did you make that so fast?"
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, look, I am here because I want you to stop talking about my friend's womb."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Look, she is a wonderful person, and she does not deserve this."
Leslie Knope,So I need you to lay off.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I am a city councilwoman, so I am not gonna Jello wrestle."
Leslie Knope,This is not about me and my constituents!
Leslie Knope,This is about you talking about my friend.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I will stand there for one second and say it, and then we're done."
Leslie Knope,Rudy.
Leslie Knope,"There, happy?"
Leslie Knope,Rudy.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,I'm just standing here.
Leslie Knope,"And I am leaving, just like you're gonna leave Ann alone."
Leslie Knope,Got dicey.
Leslie Knope,But they did invite me to participate in their topless Jello-lympics
Leslie Knope,So that's something.
Leslie Knope,"I want you to be happy, you know? I guess I just didn't consider that you would take a different path than I did."
Leslie Knope,"I tried to impose my dream on you, and that's wrong."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,But I think you do need to take a little bit more time with this decision.
Leslie Knope,Maybe employ a more methodical approach.
Leslie Knope,One that involves colorcoded binders.
Leslie Knope,The Knope way involves a lot of uterine cartoons.
Leslie Knope,"What can I tell you? Besides, what is more cuter-us than your uterus?"
Leslie Knope,"You ready, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,We're in it now.
Leslie Knope,Let's make a baby together.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,I thought that I could not love you any more than I already did.
Leslie Knope,But I was dead wrong.
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Hey! What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"No, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,That's mine.
Leslie Knope,I wanted that back.
Leslie Knope,"If I could sum up the Pawnee Commons in one word, it would be: Dynamite."
Leslie Knope,"""Dynamite"" stands for daring, youth friendly, natural, amazing, merry, inviting, tourist attractiony, and ecofriendly."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"No, there wasn't."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the planning commission has a week to decide if they want a beautiful, innovative community park or a bunch of greasy lard bombs."
Leslie Knope,I'm not editorializing.
Leslie Knope,Paunch Burger's number one selling burger is the greasy lard bomb.
Leslie Knope,Just give me a hint as to which way you guys are leaning.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,You know my plan is better for the community.
Leslie Knope,"What are we going to do, guys?"
Leslie Knope,How are we going to get that money?
Leslie Knope,I don't want a citrus reamer.
Leslie Knope,I don't want any of this stuff.
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I want is to be married to you and to somehow get 50,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and people could donate, or they could bid to put their names on everything in the park, like benches, cobblestones, trees, ants, air."
Leslie Knope,You are a genius.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,I just want to say thank you for all your hard work this week.
Leslie Knope,Give yourselves a hand.
Leslie Knope,But your applause is premature.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need you to contact three more food vendors on this list, and they need to do it for free."
Leslie Knope,"I get it, and I love it, but I don't have time for food puns right now."
Leslie Knope,Go.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, Jerry"
Leslie Knope,What's the emergency?
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,The disaster preparedness people picked today?
Leslie Knope,Each year every city in Indiana is reviewed by the Department of Emergency Preparedness.
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee has failed On last year's report, they stated, ""Every time it so much as drizzles in Pawnee, ""the town is in danger of collapsing into Thunderdome style, postapocalyptic mayhem."""
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I am the Pawnee Emergency Czar.
Leslie Knope,"And this year, we are more than prepared for your test, but, um, it just so happens, today is a little inconvenient."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your mother."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"The most important event that I have ever organized in my entire life is happening in eight hours, and I am stuck in this room."
Leslie Knope,This is a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Maybe this is a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"Nope, can't fly away."
Leslie Knope,This is real life.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Avian flu!
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,"This is a simple one, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody open their binders, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Now, if everyone just follows my instructions, we will ace this test, and we will be done in 90 minutes."
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, what could be on this?"
Leslie Knope,"Good evening, this is Channel 4 lead anchor Willow Tremaine, with breaking news."
Leslie Knope,Avian flu has just hit the town of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We go live now to St. Joseph's Medical Center for an update.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, my name is Donatella Breckinridge, M.D."
Leslie Knope,"I graduated first in my class from Harvard Medical School, so I know what I'm talking about."
Leslie Knope,"This is the avian flu, or we call ""H5N1."""
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can you hear me?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're on mine, Brett."
Leslie Knope,We're having a video conference.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit with the avian flu.
Leslie Knope,"No, this is bad news."
Leslie Knope,I need everyone there at Animal Control to eradicate all the infected birds in town.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, just pretend."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's forget we ever talked."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,This is highly irregular.
Leslie Knope,We have followed protocol to the letter.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,I should've had animal control kill you.
Leslie Knope,No one.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, well, this simulated disaster is a total disaster."
Leslie Knope,How are you?
Leslie Knope,Ron who?
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson?
Leslie Knope,On television?
Leslie Knope,"You know we want people to come, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's what you do."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me care
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this drill will never end."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, tell the firefighters"
Leslie Knope,To set up triage at the high school
Leslie Knope,And then to but I'm talking to someone important.
Leslie Knope,Let me tell him something important.
Leslie Knope,"Fix it, Ben!"
Leslie Knope,Fix it!
Leslie Knope,"I got to say, Leonard, it kind of feels like you're putting us through the ringer here."
Leslie Knope,Can you us an idea how long this is gonna take?
Leslie Knope,Eight more hours?
Leslie Knope,Are all state emergency drills this intensive?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Guys!
Leslie Knope,Come here.
Leslie Knope,The game is rigged.
Leslie Knope,"Jamm invited Leonard here, and he screwed up the bus thing on purpose to slow us down."
Leslie Knope,"It is with a heavy heart that I say, ""We have been jammed."""
Leslie Knope,The only thing we can do.
Leslie Knope,In order to save our park We have to destroy the entire town.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are making some changes to the Knope Protocol."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, how much flu vaccine does the hospital still have?"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you tell the hospital director to flush them down the toilet.
Leslie Knope,"Chief Fugleberg, I want you to order your officers to find all the infected birds in the area and perform CPR."
Leslie Knope,That's a risk we're gonna have to take.
Leslie Knope,Our top priority is now saving all the birds.
Leslie Knope,And you know what?
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just kick this up a notch?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit with A tornado quake!
Leslie Knope,Bummer.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for your time.
Leslie Knope,I think we're done here.
Leslie Knope,"I will see everyone at the gala, and I will see you in hell."
Leslie Knope,I can't hear you.
Leslie Knope,I'm a ghost.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, so am I, so you can hear me! Ghost jammed!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, why is everyone standing around? We have work to do."
Leslie Knope,Status report.
Leslie Knope,Status report! Well
Leslie Knope,"Nope, we don't have time for that."
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna have to postpone the gala, but we can't, because the deadline is tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I destroyed the entire town for nothing."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You did all this? How did you get food?
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom, I love it."
Leslie Knope,"And more importantly, so will all of our more ample citizens."
Leslie Knope,How did you get the word out?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,This is great.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Let's start the gala.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and thanks for dressing up, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, if I could have everyone's attention please? I am so happy to announce that as of one minute ago, we have reached our fundraising goal."
Leslie Knope,"Every dollar spent here tonight by you, the community, will be poured right back into this wonderful project."
Leslie Knope,"And speaking of community, I'd like to thank my community, my friends."
Leslie Knope,"It's a lesson that I have learned over and over again, but it bears repeating, No one achieves anything alone."
Leslie Knope,"Without further ado, the best band in Pawnee, Mouse Rat."
Leslie Knope,This is the best wedding present ever.
Leslie Knope,This is the best night ever.
Leslie Knope,I wish we were getting married tonight.
Leslie Knope,I can't wait three more months.
Leslie Knope,"God, I just hate the feeling of not being married to you."
Leslie Knope,"Breaking news, I've just been handed this."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit by a devastating earthquake.
Leslie Knope,"We go to our reporter, live, Winnifred Makepiece, for the story."
Leslie Knope,Winnifred?
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Jessica."
Leslie Knope,I'm here at the Pawnee Weather Center with celebrated geologist Isabella Winchester.
Leslie Knope,"Isabella, can you tell us more about this killer earthquake?"
Leslie Knope,"That's right, Winnifred, the earthquake registered an 8."
Leslie Knope,5 on the Richter scale.
Leslie Knope,That's correct.
Leslie Knope,It was a large one.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"From all of us here at Channel 4 News, I'm Jessica Rabrit."
Leslie Knope,Have a good evening and be safe out there.
Leslie Knope,This is the best night ever.
Leslie Knope,I wish we were getting married tonight.
Leslie Knope,Are we really doing this?
Leslie Knope,"Okay But, wait, my mom isn't here."
Leslie Knope,And your parents aren't here.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that makes it better."
Leslie Knope,But we reserved a space for May 16th.
Leslie Knope,And we just ordered 200 white chocolate top hats.
Leslie Knope,"You did, actually."
Leslie Knope,It's under your name.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it does."
Leslie Knope,"Every time you say it, it just feels more right."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, we're getting married tonight."
Leslie Knope,This is really great.
Leslie Knope,"You're either in or your out, buddy."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no."
Leslie Knope,We can't this is our wedding day.
Leslie Knope,"This is very bad luck, turn around."
Leslie Knope,We can't look at each other!
Leslie Knope,We have two hours to do this.
Leslie Knope,"I want you to get everyone together, and meet me at Ann's house in ten minutes."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Wait, are you messing with me?"
Leslie Knope,"Ben, now go, run!"
Leslie Knope,Run!
Leslie Knope,The turtledove acknowledges!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, where are you?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go over the duties right now."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're in charge of the dress and the hair and the makeup."
Leslie Knope,"And I was thinking, like, the sensuality of Eleanor Roosevelt combined with the animal magnetism of Lesley Stahl."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm gonna need you to walk me down the aisle."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, and, um, Jerry and Donna, I need you guys to just make sure that the gala runs smoothly."
Leslie Knope,Let's say that we're all gonna meet back here in an hour.
Leslie Knope,I love all of you.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, break!"
Leslie Knope,It's not finished.
Leslie Knope,Why didn't the seamstress finish it?
Leslie Knope,"If you're not gonna finish something three months early, then don't accept the job."
Leslie Knope,This wedding is meant to be.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna figure it out.
Leslie Knope,Now how did Cinderella finish her dress so fast?
Leslie Knope,Squirrels and birds.
Leslie Knope,That's not very helpful.
Leslie Knope,"Wait a minute, hold on."
Leslie Knope,It needs to be signed by somebody at the City Clerk's Office.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we're having a few roadblocks here."
Leslie Knope,Kind of feels like this thing is falling apart.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ann, dress duty."
Leslie Knope,"April and Andy, license duty."
Leslie Knope,No time for verbs.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Falcon?
Leslie Knope,Falcon?
Leslie Knope,There's your butt.
Leslie Knope,Did you find the rings?
Leslie Knope,"No rings, no license, no dress."
Leslie Knope,"This idea felt so right, but maybe it's just too crazy."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
Leslie Knope,It's him.
Leslie Knope,"I don't understand, this is impossible."
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, you."
Leslie Knope,"This is Li'l Sebastian, and this is a sign."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna do this.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna pull this wedding off.
Leslie Knope,Li'l Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,"Oh my God, we're running out of time."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, please, tell me that you have sewn a new dress from scratch."
Leslie Knope,"Or several dresses, 'cause I would love some options."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great, so I trust you, and make it work."
Leslie Knope,No time to do the Tim Gunn voice.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what am I talking about?"
Leslie Knope,There's always time.
Leslie Knope,"Designers, make it work."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you have less than an hour."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, everything going okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, enough."
Leslie Knope,Why don't I call you a cab?
Leslie Knope,It is over.
Leslie Knope,I won fair and square.
Leslie Knope,"And, in a half an hour, I am getting married over there to the most perfect man in the world."
Leslie Knope,And all my dreams are coming true.
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks."
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks."
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm Councilman Howser."
Leslie Knope,It is the most beautiful object I have ever seen.
Leslie Knope,It is like the Ann Perkins of dresses.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, the license, the rings, the officiant, everything?"
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Where did you even get a stink bomb?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, good thing you're an orthodontist."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,For what?
Leslie Knope,"I think that's exactly what you're supposed to do, if that mouth is attached to a drunk jerk face."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Listen to me very carefully.
Leslie Knope,"I lost my father when I was ten, I don't have any brothers, and Ken Burns never wrote me back."
Leslie Knope,So I am not getting married without you there to walk me down the aisle.
Leslie Knope,End of discussion.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess it just wasn't meant to be, after all."
Leslie Knope,We'll get married in May like we planned.
Leslie Knope,Fun.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,"It'll be good, 'cause I actually have some work I need to get started on."
Leslie Knope,I love the first floor of City Hall at night.
Leslie Knope,When all the fluorescents are half-off.
Leslie Knope,Just makes the informational fliers look so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Hoo, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, the first draft of my vows, which I wrote the day after we got engaged, clocked in at around 70 pages."
Leslie Knope,But I don't have them with me today.
Leslie Knope,Although maybe there's a copy of them in my office.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Here's what I'll say, then."
Leslie Knope,"The things that you have done for me, to help me, support me, surprise me, to make me happy, go above and beyond what any person deserves."
Leslie Knope,You're all I need.
Leslie Knope,I love you and I like you.
Leslie Knope,There were a lot of signs that Ben and I miss you in the saddest fashion should get married tonight.
Leslie Knope,"But, truth be told, we just really wanted to get married."
Leslie Knope,"When you're in love, everything seems like a sign."
Leslie Knope,I love my husband.
Leslie Knope,I love my job.
Leslie Knope,And I love my friends.
Leslie Knope,Even though they really can't handle their booze.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the honeymoon was amazing."
Leslie Knope,We saw the bus stop where a young Barack Obama used to sit and wait for the bus.
Leslie Knope,Theoretically.
Leslie Knope,Then we went and visited Honolulu City Hall.
Leslie Knope,You know.
Leslie Knope,It was amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it looked amazing, but it was closed."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have presents!"
Leslie Knope,"Um Chris, we got you an Acai tree because the Acai berry is a superfood."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, we got you some coffee, because you said, and I quote, ""I like my coffee like I like my men."
Leslie Knope,"Dark, rich, and full bodied."""
Leslie Knope,"Ann, we got you some very rare Hawaiian fertility tea, guaranteed to help you have a baby."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the busboy at our restaurant told us about a guy who we met in a parking lot, and then he had a backpack full of this stuff, and I'm just realizing now that it's not tea."
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna throw it away.
Leslie Knope,We did not forget Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"We got Jerry some earbuds, and a bag of peanuts, and the Skymall catalog."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,It's great to be here at the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
Leslie Knope,"There's so many wonderful, talented journalists here."
Leslie Knope,Also here are some reporters from the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,I love the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,Some people say that it's a useless tabloid.
Leslie Knope,But I don't think it's useless.
Leslie Knope,I think it's great for housebreaking puppies.
Leslie Knope,I am prepping for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
Leslie Knope,It's an annual affair where the media and the government roast each other.
Leslie Knope,My number one target the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,they rake me over the coals.
Leslie Knope,"Today, I take those burning coals, I shove them back down their throats, and I watch their melting flesh drip off their worthless faces!"
Leslie Knope,It's all in good fun.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need more jokes, people."
Leslie Knope,"Ben is having his first day at work, so he cannot help me."
Leslie Knope,So I need you guys to pick up the slack.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"That's not really a joke, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, well, well."
Leslie Knope,If it isn't Kim Terlando from the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,Do you happen to have a can opener?
Leslie Knope,'Cause I'm about to open this on you.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I came prepared."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, my speech doesn't need your luck."
Leslie Knope,It needs a Surgeon General's warning because it's so harmful to your health.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look, it has one."
Leslie Knope,That's how ready I am.
Leslie Knope,It was nice to see you too.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,That was my opener.
Leslie Knope,Those are my jokes.
Leslie Knope,She's stealing my jokes.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, stop laughing."
Leslie Knope,Those are stolen jokes!
Leslie Knope,Totally dead.
Leslie Knope,What am I gonna do?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"I just opened up a can of ""whoop ass"" on myself!"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Kim told all my jokes, all of them."
Leslie Knope,She must have gotten a copy of my speech.
Leslie Knope,Did anybody lose their copy?
Leslie Knope,Go stand in the corner and think about what you've done.
Leslie Knope,And no dessert!
Leslie Knope,"I need new material, and it needs to be great, and it needs to knock people on their butts, and it needs to transcend the genre of roast comedy."
Leslie Knope,"Perkins, go."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you're too beautiful to be funny."
Leslie Knope,It's not your fault.
Leslie Knope,You've never had to compensate for anything.
Leslie Knope,The rest of you ugly nerds need to give me some jokes stat.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just do impressions.
Leslie Knope,"""I'ma Borat."""
Leslie Knope,There's one.
Leslie Knope,But I need to do someone that no one has heard before.
Leslie Knope,"Like, I don't know, Neve Campbell?"
Leslie Knope,What does Neve Campbell sound like?
Leslie Knope,"Someone, [bleep] tell me what Neve Campbell sounds like."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I forgot I did this."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, no"
Leslie Knope,"""Whassup,"" Pawnee?"
Leslie Knope,Um Borat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's my time."
Leslie Knope,They're giving me the light.
Leslie Knope,"So, uh, I did great."
Leslie Knope,Denied.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then how did Kim get the speech?"
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Sun has been one step ahead of me for months.
Leslie Knope,They knew that Kernston's withdrew its sponsorship of the Commons before I even announced it.
Leslie Knope,They asked me about the sewage eruption in Ramsett Park right after Ron emailed me about it.
Leslie Knope,And Kim asked me if I liked the first season Army Wives just moments after Netflix did.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Sun hacked my email.
Leslie Knope,I've been hacked!
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, quiet!"
Leslie Knope,This is serious.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the police said they're gonna launch an investigation to see whether or not I was hacked."
Leslie Knope,"But it's very complicated, and it could take up to a month."
Leslie Knope,I have a press conference about the Pawnee Commons in two hours.
Leslie Knope,"So I need to go through every email that I've ever sent, ever."
Leslie Knope,I need to know what they might use against me.
Leslie Knope,"Can it, Unabomber."
Leslie Knope,This is an emergency.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, nothing too bad so far."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm not embarrassed by that."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's Ben and my fantasy Lord Of The Rings pen pal letters."
Leslie Knope,I am a little embarrassed by that.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great, I got a new email about the parking lot at the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,I keep getting emails all the time!
Leslie Knope,I have to do well at this press conference!
Leslie Knope,Donna!
Leslie Knope,"First, I'd like you all to check under your chairs."
Leslie Knope,I think you might be surprised and excited by what you find.
Leslie Knope,Even better.
Leslie Knope,It's dirt.
Leslie Knope,"The EPA has recently reviewed our soil samples, and they determined that we achieved, and I quote, ""Minimal acceptable standards."""
Leslie Knope,So not too shabby.
Leslie Knope,I would I would deny that report.
Leslie Knope,"It's very serious, Kim."
Leslie Knope,"It's almost as serious as email hacking, which is what you have been doing to me for weeks."
Leslie Knope,I really thought you guys would gasp there.
Leslie Knope,Midi-chlorians are a fictional substance found in the blood of Jedi knights from the movie Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
Leslie Knope,"Which, side-note, was a terrible movie."
Leslie Knope,"It almost destroyed the franchise, according to my husband."
Leslie Knope,But that is neither here nor there.
Leslie Knope,"I would just like to point out that Kim Terlando stole all of my jokes for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, and they were great jokes."
Leslie Knope,So I spent the whole night writing new ones.
Leslie Knope,"Lucky for you, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,I'm very excited to be here.
Leslie Knope,You know who else is excited to be here?
Leslie Knope,Neve Campbell.
Leslie Knope,What a great party of five.
Leslie Knope,"Or we could, you know, maybe screen a different movie."
Leslie Knope,One that's a little bit more upbeat.
Leslie Knope,Like Finding Nemo or
Leslie Knope,"Okay,Paths Of Glory it is."
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee Videodome.
Leslie Knope,And we are here because I started a program to help local business.
Leslie Knope,This is a Pawnee institution.
Leslie Knope,"This is the place where Perd Hapley shot his movie review show Lights, Camera, Perd."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's over."
Leslie Knope,"Get up, Andy."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to help out Dennis and his business."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody rent something, so we can help Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, will you rent something?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you're not helping."
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am going to rent Finding Nemo."
Leslie Knope,I'll just buy some red vines.
Leslie Knope,I think I have a plan of how to save your store.
Leslie Knope,"If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market."
Leslie Knope,But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.
Leslie Knope,That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.
Leslie Knope,But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.
Leslie Knope,Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.
Leslie Knope,"You may get a little heat for this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,So use your money wisely.
Leslie Knope,Get popular films that people wanna see.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Like Pixar.
Leslie Knope,Reese Witherspoon.
Leslie Knope,"I know this is gonna hurt, but maybe some Michael Bay."
Leslie Knope,Andy
Leslie Knope,"And the point is also that the Pawnee Videodome is a place with tremendous community value, where people gather to expand their horizons."
Leslie Knope,Any other comments here before we Ron?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing at a city council meeting?
Leslie Knope,Are you lost?
Leslie Knope,Are you hurt?
Leslie Knope,Please stop talking about wounded meat.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee needs a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art.
Leslie Knope,A place where you can rent such films as Cinema Paradiso or Rashomon.
Leslie Knope,"I haven't rented it, actually, yet."
Leslie Knope,But I like the idea that there is a place where I could rent Rashomon.
Leslie Knope,Bailiff!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for your absurd opinion, which is shared by no one."
Leslie Knope,"Now, are there any more public comments before we vote?"
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,We're not bailing anyone out.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Videodome is receiving historical landmark status.
Leslie Knope,"Bailiff, why is he back in here?"
Leslie Knope,How did you get back in here?
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Fantringham, the city of Pawnee is not gonna give you a personal loan."
Leslie Knope,I'd call the police.
Leslie Knope,This is not a blank check.
Leslie Knope,I have given specific instructions to the Pawnee Videodome about how they are going to spend their money.
Leslie Knope,"In a few days, Dennis will reopen."
Leslie Knope,"The store will serve a wider range of Pawnee's citizens, and a Pawnee cultural institution will be saved."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is amazing, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,You did it!
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,I did it.
Leslie Knope,This is me.
Leslie Knope,This isn't what people want.
Leslie Knope,Do you realize what you have done?
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee government now effectively owns a porn shop.
Leslie Knope,You have made us porn peddlers!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Everyone stop applauding.
Leslie Knope,"For the record, I was just trying to help a place that had tremendous cultural value."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I haven't."
Leslie Knope,Please don't do that.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Go ahead, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Let me have it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, I'll do it for you."
Leslie Knope,"I told you so, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,This is what happens when the government interferes with business.
Leslie Knope,"Government is bad, business is good."
Leslie Knope,Free market.
Leslie Knope,I like capitalism.
Leslie Knope,I love competition.
Leslie Knope,I'm more competitive than you.
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,"No, settle up."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won."
Leslie Knope,"Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money."
Leslie Knope,"I would suggest sticking around and watching him eat it 'cause it only takes four minutes, and it's pretty amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Although we are all sad and deeply grossed out that the Pawnee Videodome is turning into a porno palace, I am happy to announce that the Pawnee government will be hosting a weekly movie night here at the Community Center."
Leslie Knope,There will be free screenings followed by a discussion led by local film buff Dennis Lerpiss.
Leslie Knope,Tonight's film is The Sound Of Music.
Leslie Knope,And action.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is the wrong movie."
Leslie Knope,"We shut this down, please."
Leslie Knope,Shut it down.
Leslie Knope,This is not how it happened.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, move a little bit to your left and then turn to the side."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, and freeze."
Leslie Knope,"That is the exact spot where an 18 year old Ben Wyatt was inaugurated as mayor of Partridge, Minnesota."
Leslie Knope,I have chills.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it took so long.
Leslie Knope,"They gave the key to every other mayor in the town's history, and I guarantee that none of them had as cute a butt as you do."
Leslie Knope,You're so sexy when you talk about percentages.
Leslie Knope,"When Ben was mayor, he sunk all of the town's money into a winter sports complex called ""Ice Town,"" and they went bankrupt."
Leslie Knope,"Now they've invited him back as a gesture of goodwill, and he'll finally get some closure on this miserable chapter in his life."
Leslie Knope,"Yay, Ben!"
Leslie Knope,Town hero!
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"So was, like, Ben a bossy older brother?"
Leslie Knope,Did he make you watch star war movies?
Leslie Knope,That's so cute.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, get used to it."
Leslie Knope,We're sisters now.
Leslie Knope,"Now that you're both here, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,Just have a few questions.
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,"Who were Ben's high school girlfriends, and what base do you think he got to?"
Leslie Knope,"It's just every time you say that speech, I think about where you've been and where you're going and our future children and America and just our history as a nation."
Leslie Knope,"Well, somebody's nervous about the ceremony."
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Kidney stone?
Leslie Knope,We have a ceremony we need to be at in two hours.
Leslie Knope,Is there anything that we can do?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I'll call mayor Stice, and we'll reschedule the ceremony."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I took a video of him at the hospital an hour ago."
Leslie Knope,But the good news is I'm here to accept the key on his behalf.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Everything okay?
Leslie Knope,You want me to come back to the hospital?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish you were here."
Leslie Knope,It seems pretty fun and festive.
Leslie Knope,Town mascot is here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, stay away from sharp things."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a typo."
Leslie Knope,That's a major typo.
Leslie Knope,"That says ""Ice Clown."""
Leslie Knope,I'm just realizing now that's not a typo.
Leslie Knope,And it's water.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, excuse me."
Leslie Knope,"I would like to point out that we drove all the way here from Pawnee, Indiana, a city with some class, by the way."
Leslie Knope,"And, sure, my husband made an honest mistake 20 years ago."
Leslie Knope,But it was very meaningful that you were gonna finally
Leslie Knope,Be able to forgive him.
Leslie Knope,"He's in the hospital, sir."
Leslie Knope,He has a calcified rock lodged in his penis!
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, Ben Wyatt is the best thing to ever come out of this crap town."
Leslie Knope,Judy Garland's from Partridge?
Leslie Knope,Who's Lee Janzen?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ben Wyatt's better than Lee Janzen, and he's better than Judy Garland."
Leslie Knope,That's crazy.
Leslie Knope,Judy Garland's amazing.
Leslie Knope,"But Ben Wyatt is better than all of you because he cared about this town, and he tried to help it."
Leslie Knope,"You know, screw you, Partridge."
Leslie Knope,And a sled is a stupid mascot.
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you're feeling better.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, they took it back."
Leslie Knope,They wanted to get it engraved.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the key is just a metaphor."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the real key has been inside you all along."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,It's so unfair.
Leslie Knope,You worked so hard.
Leslie Knope,You've done so many great things.
Leslie Knope,"And for your hometown to treat you this way is just You know what, screw this."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna make one more stop before we leave.
Leslie Knope,Tuck in your shirt.
Leslie Knope,We're going to city hall.
Leslie Knope,"Let me start by apologizing, mayor Stice."
Leslie Knope,I had no right to disparage your town.
Leslie Knope,"Can't you just give Ben a key to the city, here, now, in your office, where no one will know your shame?"
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, babe."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,"It's it's bronze, babe."
Leslie Knope,The eagle-- We should go.
Leslie Knope,That's not a great story.
Leslie Knope,I got you something.
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,I stole it from mayor Stice's office.
Leslie Knope,Screw that guy.
Leslie Knope,You should have it.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm not giving it back to Stice."
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,Run! Run!
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Is that what's happening here?
Leslie Knope,"We have a massive pest problem in this town, and it's because the Animal Control Department has been disaster at catching animals."
Leslie Knope,They're great at ingesting and selling marijuana.
Leslie Knope,This place is a miserable suck hole run by two pothead losers.
Leslie Knope,It's completely and utterly mismanaged.
Leslie Knope,You're the people you would be calling.
Leslie Knope,Animal control has long been a repository for some of this government's most incompetent employees.
Leslie Knope,Jerry Gergich got his start there.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so our new director needs to be competent, effective, and not completely stoned all the time."
Leslie Knope,"Gosh, Jeremy, he sounds perfect."
Leslie Knope,Are his gums great too?
Leslie Knope,I was being sarcastic.
Leslie Knope,I think we should open this to the floor for more discussion.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,You guys are all fine with this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Milton's asleep, but the rest of you?"
Leslie Knope,This is how departments get mismanaged.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We are going to be thorough.
Leslie Knope,"I'm going to find a candidate, and I encourage you all to do the same, and then, we will interview all of them."
Leslie Knope,"""Boring"" is my middle name, so my thoroughly vetted candidate is going to blow your candidate out of the water."
Leslie Knope,"I have to say, this is the greatest search committee ever assembled to find a new Animal Control Department head."
Leslie Knope,Chris Traeger can do more with one foot than most people can do with three.
Leslie Knope,April Ludgate is beautiful
Leslie Knope,You are talented
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, you're passionate about animals."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Donna, you took a look at all the resumes, so send in the best candidate."
Leslie Knope,Why would you think Harris would be the best candidate?
Leslie Knope,Uhohh.
Leslie Knope,Does that mean
Leslie Knope,So why do you want this job?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, so you're not even technically qualified to work at your current job."
Leslie Knope,This may not be the job for you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming in.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Orin."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for applying, now leave."
Leslie Knope,Get out.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was a truly depressing slate of candidates."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Palletta, what is your occupation currently?"
Leslie Knope,Do you have any experience with animals?
Leslie Knope,"Ribs are better smoked than grilled, so unnailed it, with the back part of the hammer."
Leslie Knope,That is an insane statement.
Leslie Knope,"April, I got a present for you."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"I filled the bottles with fake blood, vinegar, and mud."
Leslie Knope,"On an unrelated note, do you remember all those candidates we were interviewing for the Animal Control job and how they were all total losers who didn't care about animals?"
Leslie Knope,"Except for Jerry, who was great, but who we had to pass on for other reasons."
Leslie Knope,"Anyhoo, I nominated you for the position, and your confirmation hearing is in three minutes."
Leslie Knope,Surprise.
Leslie Knope,"April, please, you will be so good at it."
Leslie Knope,You are so good with animals.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's easy they'll just ask you a few questions."
Leslie Knope,Let's practice.
Leslie Knope,What's your name?
Leslie Knope,"I will be there to help you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I will be your Pocahontas.
Leslie Knope,Climb into my papoose.
Leslie Knope,Please do this.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please."
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do it.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, don't even joke about that."
Leslie Knope,Damentally a substance that should not be abused.
Leslie Knope,"I agree, April."
Leslie Knope,Very good point.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all we need is some kind of distraction."
Leslie Knope,Grab that gavel and break your other foot.
Leslie Knope,Don't panic.
Leslie Knope,Maybe she can pull this off.
Leslie Knope,Okay! Let's take a brief recess.
Leslie Knope,"I am so sorry, April."
Leslie Knope,"You are doing terribly up there, and it's all my fault."
Leslie Knope,"It's not you, it's me."
Leslie Knope,I'm breaking up with the idea of you being director of Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,I say we just withdraw your application and let Vern become director.
Leslie Knope,He does have good teeth.
Leslie Knope,That is a genius idea.
Leslie Knope,Somebody wake up Milton.
Leslie Knope,History is being made.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope he kept a receipt."
Leslie Knope,"That was a brilliant idea from a dark, tortured genius, and I move that Animal Control be absorbed into Parks and Rec."
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Look at that, April."
Leslie Knope,You won over Jamm.
Leslie Knope,"April, I have a gift for you."
Leslie Knope,Ta da.
Leslie Knope,I had it made your first week here.
Leslie Knope,"I knew you'd be going places, so I wanted to be prepared."
Leslie Knope,Not yet.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Government shouldn't operate based on personal favors.
Leslie Knope,It should operate based on good ideas.
Leslie Knope,"April had the best idea, and today the best idea won."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, right, sorry."
Leslie Knope,I wasn't going to.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Miss Daisy."
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,"Article Two, Section Two of the Pawnee Charter reads, ""Be it decreed: Should the taxation of tea ""rise to an unacceptable level, citizens shall dump Ted into Ramsett Lake."""
Leslie Knope,Does anyone object?
Leslie Knope,"Today is Ted Party Day, where we commemorate the great Pawnee tea dump of 1817."
Leslie Knope,"Historical fun fact when the Founding Fathers wrote the charter, their oldtimey script made one of the ""a""s look like a ""d,"" so ""tea"" became ""Ted."""
Leslie Knope,It's just one of those little things that reminds us of Pawnee's rich and vibrant past.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we get to go find a guy named Ted and throw him in a lake."
Leslie Knope,One!
Leslie Knope,Two!
Leslie Knope,Three!
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ted Party Day is protected by Article Two in the town charter."
Leslie Knope,"And we have the right, nay, the obligation, to dump Ted into the lake every year."
Leslie Knope,That's the way it's always been done.
Leslie Knope,I just think you need to be careful about speculating what the Founders meant when they were writing the town charter.
Leslie Knope,That is an outdated and racist law.
Leslie Knope,"And obviously they meant ""American Indian."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ted."
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You're quoting me back to me.
Leslie Knope,But I'm gonna quote me back to you and say that Ted Party Day will never change.
Leslie Knope,I was not aware of that statute.
Leslie Knope,"I now realize that I was wrong, and it's time that we purged the books of many of our town's outdated and obscure laws."
Leslie Knope,"The bill that I have written with the full support of the city council will repeal 110 obsolete laws such as all menstruating women shall be confined to their bathtubs and Article Two, aka, Ted Party Day."
Leslie Knope,The floor is now open for public comments.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, here we go."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, a lot of passion, Mr. Blunden."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Your objection is noted and officially in the record.
Leslie Knope,Shall we proceed to a vote?
Leslie Knope,"That section defines ""Buffalo meat"" as acceptable currency."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, he's right."
Leslie Knope,He can do this.
Leslie Knope,This is exactly why we need to modernize these laws.
Leslie Knope,This kind of thing made sense when we had council in a barn and there were but now this is nuts.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Blunden, look, the laws I'm trying to get rid of have no more relevance in modern society and they're embarrassing to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Repealing them would show that we're changing with the times.
Leslie Knope,"By ""jackbooted storm troopers,"" do you mean the Pawnee Police Department?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Clyde."
Leslie Knope,I absolutely do.
Leslie Knope,I used to give tours at the Pawnee Historical House.
Leslie Knope,"Three times, ""Employee Of The Fortnight."""
Leslie Knope,You bought XMen pajamas?
Leslie Knope,"The point is is that our Founding Fathers were brilliant and they were courageous, but they also had wooden teeth and pooped in holes in the ground."
Leslie Knope,It was a more primitive time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,How about a little wager?
Leslie Knope,"How about you and I go live in that historical house, no modern technology, If you last longer, I withdraw my bill."
Leslie Knope,"I win, you stop this nonsense."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,I think there's some pretty cool things from back then.
Leslie Knope,Yikes.
Leslie Knope,Did you sleep here last night?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, let's put all modern devices in this pail."
Leslie Knope,Nothing can be used that was invented past 1817.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, Tom, you will be our referees."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for volunteering.
Leslie Knope,There's no way I'm losing this contest.
Leslie Knope,Oldtimey dress?
Leslie Knope,Check.
Leslie Knope,Extensive knowledge about early prairie life?
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,Rickets?
Leslie Knope,Cured.
Leslie Knope,Don't need to worry about rickets.
Leslie Knope,Antiperspirant?
Leslie Knope,Not allowed.
Leslie Knope,Might get a little rough in there.
Leslie Knope,Indeed.
Leslie Knope,"Man, this guy's tougher than I thought."
Leslie Knope,I just don't think he's ever gonna quit.
Leslie Knope,He has that look in his eye that Ben gets when he plays Risk.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you're gonna love what I'm churning up."
Leslie Knope,"Take a look at Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is horrifying.
Leslie Knope,Nobody eat that.
Leslie Knope,I think I'm in over my head.
Leslie Knope,Garth really knows his stuff.
Leslie Knope,He planted an entire field of barley.
Leslie Knope,How long is he planning on staying here?
Leslie Knope,Not a chance.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's that?"
Leslie Knope,Do you guys feel that?
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,How long was that under there?
Leslie Knope,I thought he was gonna last an hour max.
Leslie Knope,It's like he's getting stronger the longer he stays here.
Leslie Knope,No one.
Leslie Knope,That's why we've moved on.
Leslie Knope,"It's fun to be here on, like, a school field trip or something."
Leslie Knope,"It's so, so, so fun."
Leslie Knope,But to live like this is insane.
Leslie Knope,He must have cheated somehow.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's no way a man who's into XMen that much can stay away from the Internet that long."
Leslie Knope,We should check his phone.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now let's not read anything."
Leslie Knope,That's an invasion of his privacy.
Leslie Knope,Let's just look at his browser history and his inbox and his outbox and his Facebook page.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man."
Leslie Knope,This guy has no friends.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there, Garth."
Leslie Knope,Whatcha whittling?
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you're right."
Leslie Knope,"I admit, I can't take it anymore."
Leslie Knope,You win.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Garth, I have another proposition."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I was wondering would you like to join the Pawnee Historical Commission?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a member, and I think we could really use you."
Leslie Knope,"But the only problem is there's tons of meetings, lots of work with people who also love history, and many social occasions that you're gonna have to attend, like cocktail parties and such."
Leslie Knope,I can understand if it's something you don't want to commit to.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the team.
Leslie Knope,"Garth dropped his protest, and we were able to get rid of all the outdated laws in the town charter."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the charter is a wonderful document, but we've had the benefit of almost 200 years of learning and advancing."
Leslie Knope,Seems to me we ought to use it.
Leslie Knope,"I did not change Article Two, though."
Leslie Knope,"I just couldn't vote against a good, old-fashioned lake dunking."
Leslie Knope,Though Garth and I did come up with a compromise that I think will make everybody happy.
Leslie Knope,"From this year hence, a volunteer will represent Ted in our town's most historic and cherished tradition."
Leslie Knope,"This year, the honor goes to Mr. Garth Blundin!"
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah! He's naked, everybody! Put that away!"
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"No, Andy!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! You guys, this is the best Breakfast Day/Waffle Day joint present I have ever received."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're both dying.
Leslie Knope,I'm no better at them than you are.
Leslie Knope,"That's ridiculous, I'm so much better."
Leslie Knope,Point taken.
Leslie Knope,What about Ann Month and Ben Month?
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,But there will be a third week.
Leslie Knope,It will be called Friend Week.
Leslie Knope,"It will be commemorating this week, the week that my two best friends became each other's best friends."
Leslie Knope,I have a Friend Week present for you right now.
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, don't open that."
Leslie Knope,There's pictures in there.
Leslie Knope,Because every memory deserves to be chronicled.
Leslie Knope,Even the saggy ones.
Leslie Knope,I am putting together a scrapbook commemorating my first year on the city council.
Leslie Knope,This year whizzed by so fast.
Leslie Knope,There was so much more I wanted to do.
Leslie Knope,But time is the relentless and cruel enemy of the devoted civil servant.
Leslie Knope,It's actually one of the subtitles of my scrapbook.
Leslie Knope,Probably would've got more stuff done if I hadn't spent so much time brainstorming scrapbook titles.
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait for our day off.
Leslie Knope,But what if we took a day on and stayed here and worked on some projects?
Leslie Knope,"That sounds pretty sexy, right?"
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,You're cute.
Leslie Knope,And you're right.
Leslie Knope,Let's relax.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April."
Leslie Knope,"I'll be gone for the next 19 1/2 hours, so can you water my plants in my office?"
Leslie Knope,Are you really gonna do that?
Leslie Knope,What the [Bleep] is happening right now?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell us?
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,Just wait.
Leslie Knope,Everybody wait.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"As much as we want this to happen, we can't let Jerry just disappear."
Leslie Knope,We have to commemorate this somehow.
Leslie Knope,"Here I am thinking about how fast my first year in city council has gone, and Jerry has had 40 years whiz past him with nothing to show for it."
Leslie Knope,"This is everything in his file a handicapped parking sticker from when he got gout, a Parks and Rec golf cart driving exam which he failed, a scathing performance review."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, why would anyone be so mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait."
Leslie Knope,I wrote this.
Leslie Knope,I stand by it.
Leslie Knope,"That's what I thought, but when he started, he had a lot of dreams and goals."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at his original entry paperwork."
Leslie Knope,"He wanted to meet the mayor, have a building named after him."
Leslie Knope,I just can't let Jerry leave here with nothing and go home to an empty life.
Leslie Knope,Mac and cheese pizza?
Leslie Knope,You're making that?
Leslie Knope,"Believe it or not, Jerry, you were young once."
Leslie Knope,Young and full of dreams.
Leslie Knope,"And as unrealistic and absurd as those goals were, we are not letting you retire until we help you achieve them."
Leslie Knope,So let's see what's first.
Leslie Knope,"""Eat in city council private dining room."""
Leslie Knope,That we can achieve.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, they're with me."
Leslie Knope,"City Councilor Leslie Knope, clearance level four."
Leslie Knope,"I know, but shouldn't we?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it sounds so cool."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we just need to get in there real quick and maybe take a picture."
Leslie Knope,"He's retiring as a city hall employee after 41 years, and it was his dream to eat here."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,I promised you an executive meal and you're gonna get one.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, just okay."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go in there and take a picture with Jerry.
Leslie Knope,I put my arm around nothing.
Leslie Knope,"And then you Photoshop him in later, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, on to the next Jerry goal meet Mayor Knudson."
Leslie Knope,"No, not really."
Leslie Knope,"He resigned because of corruption and racketeering, and then he died from an overdose of pills."
Leslie Knope,But actually his real cause of death was being thrown out of a helicopter while handcuffed.
Leslie Knope,"Some people say he's still alive because they never found the body, but they never found the body because he exploded on impact."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, go over there."
Leslie Knope,Let's meet Mayor Knudson.
Leslie Knope,I'll take your picture.
Leslie Knope,"No, we can't because in a few short years, we're gonna be visiting Jerry here, and he will have achieved nothing."
Leslie Knope,Is that what you want?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, let's go."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone gather around."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is better than meatloaf."
Leslie Knope,"When Jerry first applied for this job, one of this goals was to have a building named after him."
Leslie Knope,"Again, that is an absurd request considering your work record."
Leslie Knope,But I thought maybe he could have a room named after him.
Leslie Knope,"So henceforth, Parks and Rec conference room will serve as a testament to your years of public service."
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,We can just pretend it means retire in peace.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,So bring out the cake!
Leslie Knope,"Speech, speech, speech."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Do you have a second?
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,I just popped by to apologize and to give you something.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi, Gayle."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm not really into breakfast foods."
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me?"
Leslie Knope,toast.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted your last day at work to be special, and I feel like I let you down."
Leslie Knope,So I made you this scrapbook with nearly 4 amazing pages jam-packed with memories of your time in the government.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it doesn't make any sense."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Where am I?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for sharing this with me.
Leslie Knope,I-- You have a wonderful life.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I spent your day off with Jerry instead of relaxing with you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,This is all my fault.
Leslie Knope,I love my job.
Leslie Knope,"But in the blink of an eye, I'm gonna be retiring, you know, and flying off on Marine One with you and a Secret Service detail."
Leslie Knope,"Achievements are great, but I want more than that."
Leslie Knope,I want what Jerry has.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we're always gonna work, but I think we need to fill this scrapbook too."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should take a real day off and talk about starting our family.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a mystery, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Let it go.
Leslie Knope,I think you solved it.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,What the hell is this?
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I am rage glowing."
Leslie Knope,"Second, you wanna cut funding for the Pawnee Palms Public PuttPutt?"
Leslie Knope,What did the P.P.P.P.P. ever do to you?
Leslie Knope,"Ron is very antigovernment, and he has that philosophy, but there are just certain things that you don't cut."
Leslie Knope,"Schools, police, minigolf, merrygorounds, parades, gazebo repair, roads and bridges, whatever."
Leslie Knope,"Pretty gardens, hummingbird feeders."
Leslie Knope,You also believe in making furniture.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go solder a chair instead?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I will argue, and I'm gonna win."
Leslie Knope,"That puttputt is gonna be around forever, and when I am done with it, it'll attract more visitors than the Hoover Dam."
Leslie Knope,And it'll produce double the amount of electricity.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,It already has windmills.
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,"Councilmen, I have something to discuss with you, but before I do, can I just point out how handsome the both of you look today?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, tomorrow we are voting on funding for the minigolf course, and personally, I think it is great for families, it's a great job creator, and it's extremely cute."
Leslie Knope,I'm wondering which way you two are leaning.
Leslie Knope,At least you have a good reason.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Howser is with me."
Leslie Knope,Milton is with Dexhart.
Leslie Knope,"Jeremy, you're the swing vote."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need to have Jamm fall in love with this place, so I'm rolling out the red carpet."
Leslie Knope,I need you to stay upbeat.
Leslie Knope,Keep things light.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, there's probably a less gross way to say it, but sure."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, nice putter."
Leslie Knope,What a great and funny story.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, before we start, anybody want a hot dog?"
Leslie Knope,"Yikes, okay."
Leslie Knope,How about a snow cone on me?
Leslie Knope,And what a bargain.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, kids love it, adults love it, Jamm loves it."
Leslie Knope,Everybody loves it.
Leslie Knope,It's like the Toy Story 3 of places.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, what, are we gonna stand around all day and listen to Ron spout off unrelated facts about blah, blah, blah, or are we gonna play?"
Leslie Knope,Game on.
Leslie Knope,You got 'em.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you are on fire, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,Having fun?
Leslie Knope,I think this proves that this is a wonderful place that brings joy to people's lives and brings a community together.
Leslie Knope,I am not deliberately losing.
Leslie Knope,I'm having a very off night.
Leslie Knope,"You want a word, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,I have a word for you.
Leslie Knope,"I will do anything I can to get Jamm's vote so that he will keep this course open, and it will be good for the community stop!"
Leslie Knope,I know it's more than one word.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, I cannot catch a break."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Julie, could you stay, please?"
Leslie Knope,"I Oh, well, math is worthless in real life."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's an app for calculating tips."
Leslie Knope,That's all you need.
Leslie Knope,"Math is very important, especially for young women."
Leslie Knope,Stay in school.
Leslie Knope,Weird.
Leslie Knope,I'm game.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Because minigolf is awesome.
Leslie Knope,"It's cute, and it's fun, and it needs to be saved."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, bean sprouts."
Leslie Knope,Tofu.
Leslie Knope,Ralph Nader.
Leslie Knope,Ayn Rand is a terrible writer.
Leslie Knope,"Don't mess up, don't mess up, don't mess up."
Leslie Knope,Damn it!
Leslie Knope,"No, he gets the dragon too?"
Leslie Knope,"No, you won't."
Leslie Knope,"Here, kid, want this, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Take it and run.
Leslie Knope,Run!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I believe you know this gorilla.
Leslie Knope,"It used to bring joy to hundreds of Pawnee families, but then you got rid of its habitat, so it died."
Leslie Knope,Your office shall serve as its monkey tomb.
Leslie Knope,Irrelevant.
Leslie Knope,I would pay any amount of money to properly shame you.
Leslie Knope,"Right, I mean, God forbid you're flexible in any way."
Leslie Knope,"You should just stick to your stupid, rigid, antigovernment principles."
Leslie Knope,But you know what?
Leslie Knope,Those principles stink.
Leslie Knope,They're not the right principles.
Leslie Knope,That is a terrible-- his name is Mr. Fuzzyface!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, are you here to rub it in my face that I lost your vote last night?"
Leslie Knope,You shook Ron's hand and told him that you were gonna vote to close the putt-putt.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Jamm, even for you, this is pretty sleazy."
Leslie Knope,I have six things to say to you.
Leslie Knope,One: You drive me nuts with your rigid code of honor.
Leslie Knope,"Two: Congratulations, putt-putt has been defunded."
Leslie Knope,"And only because Jamm was going to double-cross you, and I made him stick to his word."
Leslie Knope,Three: I am furious that putt-putt has been defunded.
Leslie Knope,Four: I am sorry that I said the gorilla's blood was on your hands.
Leslie Knope,'Twas Leslie killed the beast.
Leslie Knope,"Five: Putt-putt is for children, and they are the future, and I have already written a ballot measure that will save it, and it will pass."
Leslie Knope,"And six: Your rigid code of honor, which drives me nuts, makes you a wonderful human being, and I am proud to call you my friend, and don't ever change."
Leslie Knope,Very much.
Leslie Knope,"I have been in the city council for almost a year, and I'm proud of what I've done."
Leslie Knope,"But every once in a while, I end up in a situation that makes my stomach queasy."
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I hoped it would be like dealing with you."
Leslie Knope,People with strong opinions hashing it out respectfully.
Leslie Knope,And then you either realize that I'm right or you get hungry and go home and I win.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm taking that gorilla with me and putting it back in the putt-putt - when it reopens.
Leslie Knope,"God, you're the worst."
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, everyone."
Leslie Knope,A couple of announcements.
Leslie Knope,"As we all know, Ron is recovering from his hernia surgery."
Leslie Knope,So I got him flowers from all of us.
Leslie Knope,"So everybody needs to pitch in, like, 90 dollars."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because I ordered a beautiful bouquet of daffodils, from a website, after a few glasses of wine."
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, I think you might be getting some daffodils, too."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you're definitely getting some."
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,Time will tell.
Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm leaving early tonight because I am a judge in the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously."
Leslie Knope,"April, whoever Miss Pawnee is, is gonna be the representative of womanhood in our town."
Leslie Knope,"And as a judge, let me assure you that this year's Miss Pawnee will be chosen for her talent and poise."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, April."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,That's wonderful.
Leslie Knope,"You know, that is why I decided to become a judge."
Leslie Knope,"So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy."
Leslie Knope,"April, it's unethical for me to show you favoritism."
Leslie Knope,You and I are like family.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What you doing in these parts?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, this one's a beauty."
Leslie Knope,"You know, in the 1880s, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"This depicts kind of a famous fight between Reverend Bradley and Anna Beth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven."
Leslie Knope,"The original title of this was ""A Lively Fisting."""
Leslie Knope,"But you know, they had to change it for obvious reasons."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah, sure."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Let me check my schedule.
Leslie Knope,Let's see.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's Madeleine Albright.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's Madeleine Albright."
Leslie Knope,The first female Secretary of State.
Leslie Knope,"Good, a couple days are free."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we could just, you know"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,You want to hear something awful?
Leslie Knope,He didn't even know who Madeleine Albright was.
Leslie Knope,"Not you, too."
Leslie Knope,"Madeleine Albright, the first female Secretary of State."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Dave."
Leslie Knope,That cop that I met.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I just don't know if I can date someone who doesn't share my interests.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, could you date someone who doesn't love giving vaccinations?"
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow judges."
Leslie Knope,"I am Judge Leslie Knope and this is my colleague, Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,He's also gonna be a judge.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course, Ray."
Leslie Knope,How do you do?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom and I are very happy to be here."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm sure between the five of us, we will choose the most well-rounded, intelligent, modern and forward thinking woman to represent our fine town."
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Leslie Knope,She's good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, they can't all be winners."
Leslie Knope,She's not even twirling the baton.
Leslie Knope,She got me.
Leslie Knope,She got me good.
Leslie Knope,She got
Leslie Knope,"No, Susan isn't a perfect 10."
Leslie Knope,"But in my mind, Susan is the perfect Miss Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Her values are strong, her commitment to her job is very admirable, she has a real sense ofâ¦"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey!"
Leslie Knope,Over here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have a real question, if you don't mind, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Trish, Alexis de Tocqueville called America ""The Great Experiment."""
Leslie Knope,What can we do as citizens to improve on that experiment?
Leslie Knope,Don't applaud that.
Leslie Knope,"No, she didn't-- She didn't answer my question."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,"Well, her name is Trish."
Leslie Knope,"And I don't think we should rush this, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, take Susan, for example."
Leslie Knope,I think--
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hold on, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Look, whoever we choose is going to represent the ideal woman for a year."
Leslie Knope,She'll be someone that little girls in South Central Indiana look up to.
Leslie Knope,"Now, nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Consider yourselves sequestered.
Leslie Knope,"I'm a judge, so I don't want to sound partial."
Leslie Knope,But Trish will win this pageant over my dead body.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, may I ask, what was your talent?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ray."
Leslie Knope,"Good, I like what you're saying."
Leslie Knope,Let's keep talking.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so, it's still 3- 2 for Trish."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, all I ask is that you look into your hearts, and think, really think, about what you've seen and ask yourselves, ""Who is the most impressive woman here tonight?"""
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just take a moment to give a round of applause to all the contestants this evening?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Especially Susan.
Leslie Knope,"This isn't the first time that Susans have lost to Trishes, and it won't be the last."
Leslie Knope,"Susan and I will continue on until the women of Pawnee are judged not by the flatness of their tummies, but by the contents of their brains."
Leslie Knope,"And, Trish, I may not have voted for you, but now is the time for us to come together."
Leslie Knope,"I hope you honor this crown with dignity, and a devotion to all--"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,We did.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Dave, I like you."
Leslie Knope,But I'm just busy.
Leslie Knope,"Right now, my schedule is just so full."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Thanks for coming.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'd love to go out with you."
Leslie Knope,How about Friday for dinner?
Leslie Knope,"No, they will not be joining us."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,I figured.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Look in your folders.
Leslie Knope,You will find information about founder's week.
Leslie Knope,"And before we start brainstorming, I just wanna thank Ron for lending us his cabin."
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Founder's week is a yearly celebration of all things Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"We've got a pie eating contest, a giant petting zoo, and the granddaddy of them all, the founder's week parade."
Leslie Knope,"I don't wanna overhype it, but our parade makes the rose bowl parade look like a turds on wheels convention."
Leslie Knope,Let's do an exercise.
Leslie Knope,"April, what makes Pawnee the best city in the world?"
Leslie Knope,"Donna, help me out."
Leslie Knope,What makes Pawnee so great?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we need to focus."
Leslie Knope,"I want this to be the best founder's week ever, okay?"
Leslie Knope,No more distractions.
Leslie Knope,Why did you have to bring her here?
Leslie Knope,"Thanks to a lot of hard work and some very dedicated civil servants, this has been a banner year for our city."
Leslie Knope,Obesity and diabetes are down.
Leslie Knope,Test scores are up.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee raccoon attacks have decreased.
Leslie Knope,"People can now suddenly feel safe in our parks, grocery stores, and hospitals."
Leslie Knope,I am very proud of what we've accomplished.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, this forum is kind of my victory lap."
Leslie Knope,I am here today to ask you one question.
Leslie Knope,Are you better off now than you were a year ago?
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Uhoh.
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, I've never stripped away anyone's freedoms."
Leslie Knope,I simply stopped a restaurant from serving an insane which only made our citizens healthier.
Leslie Knope,"And frankly, I don't see any of those citizens standing up and complaining about"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I see them."
Leslie Knope,"A gym opened, and it stayed in business."
Leslie Knope,And people checking into the E.R. after ingesting a whole candy wrapper is down 40%.
Leslie Knope,Those school lunches are incredibly unhealthy.
Leslie Knope,You somehow convinced the school board that napkins are a vegetable.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Dewey."
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a horrible price to pay for something as trivial as gender equality.
Leslie Knope,This feels strangely personal.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's because they're all standing up saying how much they hate me as a person.
Leslie Knope,"If you are referring to my fight to teach comprehensive sex education, you need to at least acknowledge the fact that STDs are down 14% from last year."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's no, it's"
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"There you go, perfect example."
Leslie Knope,No need for further questions on that one.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it used to be a quaint, little movie rental place with a lot of community value."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, Brandi."
Leslie Knope,"Gah, gah, gah, gah"
Leslie Knope,"No, what happened was there was a misunderstanding, and I accidentally got the government involved in an unseemly business, but I cleared that up, and everything's fine."
Leslie Knope,It's not like I'm some kind of sex crazed maniac or something.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Chris, could you just please"
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,That's true.
Leslie Knope,Parades and your butt: My two vices.
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect thing to take my mind off of yesterday.
Leslie Knope,I am going to pretend that this is my victory parade and the town is celebrating my hard work and dedication.
Leslie Knope,Kernston's Rubber Nipple Company elects a nipple king and a nipple queen every year to ride on the float.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Chris."
Leslie Knope,It's wonderful.
Leslie Knope,Is that me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's me, and damn them."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, stop, please!"
Leslie Knope,Stop!
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to stop your parade or anything, but I just have to say something here, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I don't think this is very fair!
Leslie Knope,Certain people are lashing out at me because of things that I did this year.
Leslie Knope,But I am not trying to stop you from having fun.
Leslie Knope,I am an extremely fun person.
Leslie Knope,I've never felt this way before.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just quit.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should both quit, and we should move to the Bahamas, live on a beach, catch fish with homemade spears."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was Elizabeth Warren."
Leslie Knope,"Like, I'm not going to watch that live?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"But even if I wanted to fight this recall, how would I do it?"
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming.
Leslie Knope,"As most of you probably know, there is a large committee that has announced plans to recall me from office."
Leslie Knope,My response to them is this: Bring it on.
Leslie Knope,Step up.
Leslie Knope,Step Up 2: The Streets.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, my adrenaline is pumping, so all I can think of is dance movie titles."
Leslie Knope,Stomp the Yard.
Leslie Knope,There's one.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I work very hard for this town, as hard as I can, and all that matters to me is whether or not everyone here thinks that they are better off now than they were a year ago."
Leslie Knope,I think you are.
Leslie Knope,"If you disagree with me, then go ahead and recall me."
Leslie Knope,Go crazy.
Leslie Knope,You Got Served.
Leslie Knope,"Silver Linings Playbook, kind of."
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,"Again, all I really care about is are you better off?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wasn't asking you specifically, but I'm happy to hear that, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,"So, in conclusion, recall, shmecall."
Leslie Knope,"No, I can't end my big press conference by saying ""Recall, shmecall."""
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, can you help me out here?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, honey."
Leslie Knope,Honey.
Leslie Knope,That's another dance movie with Jessica alba.
Leslie Knope,"Alright, people."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee river's not gonna clean itself.
Leslie Knope,"Volunteer weekend task force, mobilize."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how's it going with you guys?"
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy for you.
Leslie Knope,Just remember to use protection.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no, don't."
Leslie Knope,That would defeat the purpose.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no."
Leslie Knope,Do your thing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, hello there."
Leslie Knope,We're coming back from cleaning up the Pawnee River.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing I love more than squeegeeing slime off a highway underpass.
Leslie Knope,Okeydokey.
Leslie Knope,"Well, catch you later."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Wha What who's what the
Leslie Knope,I justI'm having so many thoughts and feelings that I'm paralyzed right now.
Leslie Knope,"Ron is getting married, and I love him, and I care about him, and this is the greatest day ever, and I do not have time to talk about this!"
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"If you would just slow down a little, then I could arrange balloons or a flower cake or a bouncy castle"
Leslie Knope,"Diane, you have no idea what that means to me."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is like a waking nightmare of happiness."
Leslie Knope,I need to get some flowers.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you hold this colorful bouquet of highlighters?
Leslie Knope,"Rice, I need to find some rice, I need to throw some rice."
Leslie Knope,Why is there no rice in this municipal government building?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,"Let's pump the brakes, Carl, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, it's going to start!"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, it's happening!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,She said yes!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"Before you Carl, just one second."
Leslie Knope,"I would just like to give a short speech, if I may."
Leslie Knope,"At first glance, it may seem as though Ron Swanson and I have nothing in common, but Webster's dictionary defines ""friend"""
Leslie Knope,It's ugh!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Hooray!
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Pretend this is rice!
Leslie Knope,That was beautiful.
Leslie Knope,The people who want to boot me from office have been viciously attacking me for weeks.
Leslie Knope,"Last week, I was an answer in the Pawnee Journal's Crossword Puzzle."
Leslie Knope,"The clue ""Who's the worst,"" but you know what?"
Leslie Knope,We're fighting back.
Leslie Knope,I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.
Leslie Knope,"We are currently in phase 26: ""No problem too small."""
Leslie Knope,"Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Gretel, how can I help you today?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're on it, because ""No problem too small."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have about 30 more people who want to come into my office and complain to my face."
Leslie Knope,This person to person campaigning is kind of wearing me down.
Leslie Knope,"Good memory, sunfish."
Leslie Knope,Let's press on.
Leslie Knope,I have to come up with some solution for this slug problem.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think ""No problem too small"" is working."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers."
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,It was an amazing phase.
Leslie Knope,Janet Napoli freaking tano?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is amazing and perfect.
Leslie Knope,"This is exactly the kind of big, splashy thing that's gonna get the voters' attention."
Leslie Knope,When is the ceremony?
Leslie Knope,London?
Leslie Knope,We're going to London?
Leslie Knope,"We're going to London, you guys!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, we are going to be sightseeing today."
Leslie Knope,"Andy and Ben are gonna go to their meeting, and then we're gonna go back to the hotel for lunch, and I will spend the day getting to know London's history."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel bad about leaving Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,It's like leaving my kid at home without a babysitter.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right, as usual."
Leslie Knope,Good luck.
Leslie Knope,"The Notting Hill bus tour starts at 2:00, the Love Actually bus tour starts at 2:30, andoh, the Bridget Jones bus tour starts at 2:30 also."
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your pick."
Leslie Knope,"""So I long for a day when women in government will simply be seen as people in government, but until then, I will work to make Pawnee, my wonderful hometown, as good as it can be."""
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this trip is amazing, but I miss Pawnee, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I want to know what's happening there.
Leslie Knope,One little news blast wouldn't hurt.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What now?
Leslie Knope,How how did they get that picture so
Leslie Knope,But I just put
Leslie Knope,But isn't it a
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Well, not to Indiana, but there's a 9:00 redeye to Lisbon, and then I can catch the 4:30 A.M. back to Edinburgh, connect through Houston, head on up to Cincinnati and then rent a car, drive around 90, and I'll be home two hours earlier than if I flew home as planned."
Leslie Knope,Easy breezy!
Leslie Knope,You have some perspective!
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you're right.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'm stressed.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need to calm down."
Leslie Knope,Let's go walk past Colin Firth's house again.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a big cheering section."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at your face."
Leslie Knope,It's just so symmetrical.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're from Denmark, of course."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, what part of Denmark are you from?"
Leslie Knope,They made a statue of you!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Is that goat cheese?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Pawnee, Indiana, is a wonderful town, and I love it, but they hate me."
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to kick me out of office.
Leslie Knope,"One time, they made a pinata of my face, and then everybody in the town came and took turns hitting it with a stick, and they filled it with broccoli, just to add insult to injury but politics you know what I mean, right?"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,How was your meeting?
Leslie Knope,Uh yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women."
Leslie Knope,You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're just truly"
Leslie Knope,"You know, I've been a public servant for a long time."
Leslie Knope,And you know how I spend my days?
Leslie Knope,Cleaning slime out of rivers and removing slugs from people's front yards.
Leslie Knope,"And I love my town, but you know how they repay me?"
Leslie Knope,By hating me.
Leslie Knope,They hate me.
Leslie Knope,They want to recall me.
Leslie Knope,I wish I could move to Silkeborg and dance with a reindeer.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,"They like me in Silkeborg more than my own hometown, and I've never even been there."
Leslie Knope,"I love Pawnee, but sometimes it sucks."
Leslie Knope,"The people can be very mean and ungrateful, and they cling to their fried dough and their big sodas, and then they get mad at me when their pants don't fit."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm sick of it."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is filled with a bunch of peepee-heads.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much for this amazing award.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry I said ""peepee-heads."""
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, it's how I feel."
Leslie Knope,"Stupid, ungrateful town."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you said it yourself: We're 4,000 miles away."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Jerry who?
Leslie Knope,"Jer oh, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, why are you calling me?"
Leslie Knope,I don't want to waste my international minutes.
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, ""everyone""?"
Leslie Knope,"Bloody hell, Jerry!"
Leslie Knope,Why are we here?
Leslie Knope,"You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I have to be the grownup.
Leslie Knope,But it's so hard!
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,And nobody ever thanks you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, April does that all the time."
Leslie Knope,She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I almost forgot."
Leslie Knope,"I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you do."
Leslie Knope,"If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed."
Leslie Knope,"This is London, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days."
Leslie Knope,"This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race."
Leslie Knope,"I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go."
Leslie Knope,I am not gonna let you go.
Leslie Knope,"Are you sure you should be working? I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods."
Leslie Knope,"Right, yeah, of course."
Leslie Knope,I'm so goofed-up right now.
Leslie Knope,I'm so jet-lagged.
Leslie Knope,"I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called ""Zapvigil,"" which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake."
Leslie Knope,"So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab."
Leslie Knope,"Stay away from me, crab! I'm just kidding."
Leslie Knope,I know it's Ann.
Leslie Knope,Ohh.
Leslie Knope,Don't pinch me!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone?"
Leslie Knope,April
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Gretel! Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia."
Leslie Knope,"Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs."
Leslie Knope,"You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away."
Leslie Knope,Isn't that great?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll put one slug back."
Leslie Knope,"Either way, your problem is solved."
Leslie Knope,"That's not why we do this, April."
Leslie Knope,"We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause."
Leslie Knope,"Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all."
Leslie Knope,But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,On to the next complaint.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase."
Leslie Knope,"Let's see, it is ""48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, brother."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,You're getting hugged right now.
Leslie Knope,I'm giving you a hug.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,"But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing."
Leslie Knope,"And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there's one more thing I want to try."
Leslie Knope,I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig.
Leslie Knope,Wear it for me.
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,"No, not sexy."
Leslie Knope,Failed experiment.
Leslie Knope,Take it off.
Leslie Knope,Just take it off.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,That's the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're on my team.
Leslie Knope,"I'm losing the recall election, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Slamming Eagleton is the easiest way to score some points.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Am I proud of it?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Because Eagleton sucks.
Leslie Knope,But is it the classiest move?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks."
Leslie Knope,Would I do it again?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks."
Leslie Knope,"This year, we get to host the Pawnee Eagleton tipoff classic."
Leslie Knope,That awful human being is Ingrid de Forest.
Leslie Knope,She's a city councilor from Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,She thinks she's so great because she won the Miss Indiana Beauty Pageant.
Leslie Knope,Last year.
Leslie Knope,While she was in office.
Leslie Knope,And pregnant.
Leslie Knope,"As always, we would like to make a friendly wager with Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"If you beat us this year, we will give you a basket of apples from our Pawnee orchard."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, these are pesticide free."
Leslie Knope,"I ate one of these for breakfast this morning, and I found a worm in it."
Leslie Knope,"So, I bet somebody feels pretty stupid right now."
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I'd do if I was an Eagletonian.
Leslie Knope,I'd pop a Xanax and ask my butler to help me out.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not saying that Eagletonians are out of touch."
Leslie Knope,"But when you tell 'em it's time to change their oil, they ask, ""Extra virgin or white truffle?"""
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys."
Leslie Knope,I'll see ya at the game.
Leslie Knope,"Unless, of course, you're an Eagletonian, and then you'll be too busy polishing your monocle at the caviar store."
Leslie Knope,Knope out.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and auditing sistah."
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,"If there's a problem with Eagleton, I wanna be there."
Leslie Knope,That's like a dream come true.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I have a new routine I'm working on."
Leslie Knope,"Kind of like a Jeff Foxworthy type thing, but about Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"If you make your omelet out of Faberge eggs, you just might"
Leslie Knope,"It really is a pleasure to see you in this context, Ingrid."
Leslie Knope,Say cheese.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,You look beautiful.
Leslie Knope,Is that 100 Euros?
Leslie Knope,What does this mean for them?
Leslie Knope,Ahh.
Leslie Knope,Now that is the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna hand me the recall election.
Leslie Knope,I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.
Leslie Knope,Now I get to remind people of that fact as we watch our worst enemy collapse into bankruptcy.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, guess what I get to do after the game now."
Leslie Knope,You pretend you're Ingrid.
Leslie Knope,Let's pretend this box is the basket of apples I bet them on the game.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Leslie Knope,Do you like apples?
Leslie Knope,Do you like apples?
Leslie Knope,How about them apples?
Leslie Knope,You may find it very informative.
Leslie Knope,Let's get started with our first slide.
Leslie Knope,"""Well, well, well"" Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Leslie Knope,"""You blew it."""
Leslie Knope,"""Super hard."""
Leslie Knope,"""Complete buffoonery."""
Leslie Knope,"""It's hilarious."""
Leslie Knope,"And ""You deserve it."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like they took it easy on us when they stole all our money and seceded from our town?"
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'll skip ahead.
Leslie Knope,We do have a plan.
Leslie Knope,"We are willing to provide a bridge loan for 50,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,"25% interest, compounded monthly."
Leslie Knope,And you need to release a statement that says that Pawnee rules and Eagleton drools.
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, blondie."
Leslie Knope,"Your butler made your bed, now you gotta lie in it."
Leslie Knope,"And if you walk out that door, none of us here, and I repeat, none of us will ever help you again."
Leslie Knope,Think fast.
Leslie Knope,"Fantastic, right?"
Leslie Knope,I made enough of them for everybody to wear at the game.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you ready for dinner?"
Leslie Knope,We can go over the poll numbers.
Leslie Knope,I can meet you there.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What is she doing here?
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"I don't need any lip from you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You're in trouble because of your own stupidity.
Leslie Knope,For what?
Leslie Knope,Wearing Chanel suits?
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad that you're doing this.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am mad that you're doing this."
Leslie Knope,"But even worse, I'm mad that you just lied to me about it."
Leslie Knope,"We all swore that we weren't gonna ever help her again, ever."
Leslie Knope,I speak for all of us in all matters.
Leslie Knope,That is what you tacitly agreed to when you married me.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, let's go."
Leslie Knope,You've changed your mind.
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna help her anymore.
Leslie Knope,Whoa.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm really surprised you're sitting on this side of the bleachers and not on the Eagleton side with your new girlfriend Ingrid."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,They wouldn't help us if the tables were turned.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're 50 points ahead, and they're still dunking."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at this guy."
Leslie Knope,There's no way he is in high school.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I do a little, yes."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry that I blew up at you yesterday.
Leslie Knope,"With all the recall stuff happening, I just really need to feel like you're on my team, and seeing you with them made me feel like you weren't."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say something.
Leslie Knope,"And if I throw up on you after I say it, just know that you've been warned."
Leslie Knope,I know how we can help Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Or, if I pull it off, I just might win."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, a very smart member of my team pointed out it's the right thing to do."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"After an all-night strategy session, the towns of Pawnee and Eagleton have come up with a potential solution to Eagleton's budget crisis."
Leslie Knope,The town of Eagleton will be dissolved and re-absorbed into Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee will provide some government services, as well as taking on some of Eagleton's debts."
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I hate Eagletonians as much as you do."
Leslie Knope,I hate their stupid beautiful faces and their stupid shiny hair.
Leslie Knope,Because they are our neighbor and they've sprained their ankle.
Leslie Knope,"And when your neighbor sprains his ankle, you help him off the court."
Leslie Knope,"I understand you have concerns and questions, and we are here to listen to them."
Leslie Knope,"One at a time, please."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll take it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think at the end of the day, everybody realizes it's something we have to do."
Leslie Knope,"- Oh, you don't want them."
Leslie Knope,All of Pawnee's apples have been recalled-- - g. coli.
Leslie Knope,I wish.
Leslie Knope,Way easier to treat.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to Pawnee!
Leslie Knope,This is a historic day.
Leslie Knope,"At 12:01 this morning, the city of Eagleton ceased to exist and was reabsorbed back into Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Things are exactly the way they were back in 1817, except, you know, women and minorities can vote, we have indoor toilets, and we no longer burn widows for learning arithmetic."
Leslie Knope,"There are two Eagleton departments Pawnee does not have: the Department of Infinity Pool Design and the Department of Dressage, which I am told is a fancy horseriding thing."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take it easy, Alonzo."
Leslie Knope,"All you horse dancing people, sit in your saddles if you will."
Leslie Knope,"The rest of you, welcome to your new departments."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Pawnee Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Soon, you will be paired up with a person who was roughly your equivalent in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you'll be with Craig."
Leslie Knope,"April, you'll be with someone named Tynnyfer."
Leslie Knope,"And Ron, your guy is also named Ron."
Leslie Knope,"You do have a counterpart, actually."
Leslie Knope,"His name is Eric, and I've heard he's amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I also have a little surprise."
Leslie Knope,I would like to introduce our new filing temp.
Leslie Knope,We brought Jerry out of retirement because we have a mountain of filing to get through.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Jerry Gergich."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm trying to save as many jobs as possible, but we're gonna have to lose some people."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure who we should keep.
Leslie Knope,"April, Tom and Donna are three of the best human beings that have ever lived."
Leslie Knope,Ron is basically a better version of George Washington.
Leslie Knope,But the Eagletonians are probably good too.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this is a surprise."
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, this might be a very interesting challenge for you, because Pawnee has the very first documented case of megadiabetes."
Leslie Knope,And the only know occurrence of Lou Gehrig's other disease.
Leslie Knope,We've been written about in textbooks.
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,Ahem.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I feel sorry for her.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, nobody can fill your shoes, Ann."
Leslie Knope,With your tiny little doll feet.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Did somebody put you up to this?
Leslie Knope,Was it Evelyn?
Leslie Knope,I knew she was a monster.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what were you saying?"
Leslie Knope,"So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're telling me you're not thinking about leaving Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Is this one of those classic Ann ""not"" jokes?"
Leslie Knope,"Like, ""I'm leaving Pawnee not!"""
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that you had started.
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I've got a ton of work to do."
Leslie Knope,"I'm super busy, so you can let yourself"
Leslie Knope,"Look, if Ann wants to leave Pawnee, I get it."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, who wants to stay in the greatest town in the world with her best friend and be happy forever when she can abandon her soul sister like an old shoe and move to a garbage city full of jerks."
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Leslie Knope,No hard feelings.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry for the delay, ladies, I was busy being ambushed by treachery."
Leslie Knope,So did you have a chance to compare notes on your respective duties?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,It's nice to see a friendship blossoming instead of wiling away like a dying turd flower.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what I think is crazemazing?"
Leslie Knope,Commitment.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for someone who's in it for the long haul.
Leslie Knope,"We are basically creating a new version of Pawnee, and if Pawnee is gonna commit to one of you, you need to commit to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Tynnyfer, do you have kids?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me a little about yourself."
Leslie Knope,You only eat vegetables that have been thrown out in people's dumpsters.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Eagleton Ron, we here in Pawnee value loyalty above all else."
Leslie Knope,So would you be opposed to signing an official loyalty pledge to our new town?
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's not good.
Leslie Knope,I should probably talk to him.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,You're the best.
Leslie Knope,"All right, Donna."
Leslie Knope,There's gonna have to be some cutbacks.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, your job is secure, of course."
Leslie Knope,You're basically the glue of this department.
Leslie Knope,But I think Craig's gonna have to go.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Donna, I'm right here."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what are you saying?"
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking about leaving?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Even Larry wants out?
Leslie Knope,What the hell is happening here?
Leslie Knope,Does everybody think that running a town is just some game where people can come and go as they please?
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's not fair.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to watch the Oscars with Ben alone this year.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, don't you remember Angelina Jolie and the leg dress moment?"
Leslie Knope,"He had, and I quote, ""no comment."""
Leslie Knope,How can you not have an extreme reaction about a dress like that?
Leslie Knope,It just doesn't make any sense!
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I can't understand you.
Leslie Knope,You've developed some accent from that new town you might move to!
Leslie Knope,It seems like no one around here understands the meaning of loyalty.
Leslie Knope,I am the merger czar.
Leslie Knope,I make the rules.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna teach people the meaning of loyalty in a language they will understand-- complicated legalese.
Leslie Knope,It's just a little something that I drew up for all the employees of the new town.
Leslie Knope,"Basic boilerplate language, 50 year commitment, blah, blah, blah."
Leslie Knope,What's the big deal?
Leslie Knope,I'm just trying to stop time with legally binding friendship contracts.
Leslie Knope,What part of that do you not understand?
Leslie Knope,Fine!
Leslie Knope,You only have to work here until I'm dead!
Leslie Knope,Is that better?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all Eagleton people meet me in the conference room."
Leslie Knope,"All Pawnee people, sit at your desks."
Leslie Knope,And take it personally.
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot, so I made unity cookies with the Pawnee town's original colors of blue and yellow."
Leslie Knope,"However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard."
Leslie Knope,But do not worry.
Leslie Knope,"I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out."
Leslie Knope,Mmm!
Leslie Knope,Sugar mustard.
Leslie Knope,"You are a man of principle and I respect that, cool Ron."
Leslie Knope,"So, what's your story, new Ann?"
Leslie Knope,You're kind of pretty.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're not ""Ann"" pretty, but you have potential."
Leslie Knope,"Shut your kind of pretty mouth and, uh, eat a mustard cookie."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's chitchat, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other and then become familiar best friends.
Leslie Knope,That's so Craig.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Craig!"
Leslie Knope,"We have fun, don't we?"
Leslie Knope,"Do you guys remember when this all started and I came in here with the cookies, and then Craig said something so Craig and we all laughed, and we were like, ""Craig!"""
Leslie Knope,Do you think it would be weird if we held hands?
Leslie Knope,Probably.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Ron, I am talking to my best friends."
Leslie Knope,Let me go!
Leslie Knope,"Best friends, attack Ron!"
Leslie Knope,I don't need to explain myself to you! I am the czar.
Leslie Knope,I can do as I please.
Leslie Knope,Those who cross the czar feel the wrath of the czar! Ann is thinking about leaving Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Moving, with Chris."
Leslie Knope,"Nice, Ron? Edible arrangements are nice."
Leslie Knope,"This is volcanically hot betrayal! She is my best friend! She's thinking about leaving, just like that!"
Leslie Knope,"And she wants to ""talk to me"" about it? It's like, I don't even know what to say."
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,I don't even need her.
Leslie Knope,"I've got Tynnyfer now, and Craig, and Eric, the racist drug dealer who I've yet to meet."
Leslie Knope,Those are my real friends.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Eagleton Ron."
Leslie Knope,I think it might be time for you to go.
Leslie Knope,"This Ron has the position pretty much locked up, and, uh, I don't think we have any room for you in our department."
Leslie Knope,"What I really want to say is, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,You're my best friend.
Leslie Knope,This whole thing is just scary and confusing.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,"I want to talk about this, all of this, whatever it means."
Leslie Knope,Was that okay?
Leslie Knope,Well
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, you are excused, Fake Ann."
Leslie Knope,That was six hours well spent.
Leslie Knope,I thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, almost."
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,It's not important.
Leslie Knope,The only thing that's important is you.
Leslie Knope,I'm ready to talk about this.
Leslie Knope,I want to talk about this.
Leslie Knope,Is now a good time?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I've gained a lot of ground in the polls."
Leslie Knope,That's good news.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, your heart's in the right place."
Leslie Knope,Your heart and your butt.
Leslie Knope,I will not go negative.
Leslie Knope,Crap on a turd!
Leslie Knope,The committee to recall Leslie Knope is relentless.
Leslie Knope,Look what they're handing out at elementary schools.
Leslie Knope,"We all know that I cannot spend as much money on ads as my opponent, but I printed out 10,000 ""Don't"" stickers and 10,000 question mark stickers."
Leslie Knope,"That way, if you see a sign and it says ""Recall Knope,"" all you need to do is add the question mark and the ""Don't,"" and suddenly, it reads, ""Recall Knope? Don't."""
Leslie Knope,"Yep, that's a much better idea."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"April, no!"
Leslie Knope,"I'm pleased to formally submit Bill 68J, which funds a new bike path in Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,I also submit Bill 68R.
Leslie Knope,You guys want to delay all my bills?
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna keep my head down and continue to get work done.
Leslie Knope,"Gahhh, you guys are the worst!"
Leslie Knope,It absolutely is personal.
Leslie Knope,"That is the definition of ""personal."""
Leslie Knope,It's probably just some bored teenager who hacked the account.
Leslie Knope,We think that you may have accidentally tweeted from the Parks and Rec account rather than your own personal account.
Leslie Knope,"""See you tonight."""
Leslie Knope,"""Hope you like tongue baths, you big, nasty fireman."""
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Leslie Knope,"What's important is, we deleted the tweet, and nobody is gonna know it's you, but Donna, you know, be more careful in the future."
Leslie Knope,This could've really blew up in my face.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"No one is getting fired, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Jamm is trying to use this to hurt me in the recall.
Leslie Knope,"He's trying to take me down, and he's willing to attack my friends in the process?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,He is not gonna sully your name.
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry about it, Donna."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna nip this in the bud.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's actually quite simple."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, a Parks and Rec employee forgot to log out of the Parks and Rec Twitter account, they posted a personal, of the Parks and Rec private message by accident, and, uh, that person is very sorry, and it won't happen again."
Leslie Knope,I just told you what happened.
Leslie Knope,It was an unfortunate mistake.
Leslie Knope,Not a word.
Leslie Knope,"Well, because I learned new information."
Leslie Knope,"When I was four, I thought that chocolate milk came from brown cows, and then I flip-flopped when I found out that there was something called chocolate syrup."
Leslie Knope,It's utterly meaningless.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, does anyone else here see a double standard?"
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart is currently being sued by two different women for sexual harassment, one of whom was the judge in the first woman's trial."
Leslie Knope,She was reading the emails that you sent to the first woman.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I don't even know what she writes on there!"
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let them fire you.
Leslie Knope,That's what you really think of me?
Leslie Knope,You think I'm annoying?
Leslie Knope,My thing?
Leslie Knope,My thing is not being annoying.
Leslie Knope,"My things are making friendship bracelets and dancing like nobody's watching, thinking up really cool nicknames for my friends."
Leslie Knope,"You of all people should know that, El Diablo!"
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know anymore.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for trying."
Leslie Knope,I have a question for you.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm annoying?
Leslie Knope,Are you lying?
Leslie Knope,Are you trying to protect my feelings?
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm being annoying right now?
Leslie Knope,So you do think I'm annoying.
Leslie Knope,Now who's annoying?
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope is stepping up at these hearings and taking a bullet for me."""
Leslie Knope,"""hashtag sister from another mister, hashtag boss bitch."""
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry if I can be little annoying at times, but one person's annoying is another person's inspiring and heroic, so, you know, who are we to judge?"
Leslie Knope,I can't promise that I won't be inspiring and heroic in the future.
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Leslie Knope,I got you an apology present.
Leslie Knope,"It is all of your favorite lipsticks and nail polishes, and I got the same ones too."
Leslie Knope,"I printed out a schedule, so we can wear them at the same time."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I would like you to open each one in front of me, and tell me how you feel about them individually."
Leslie Knope,Are you tweeting this?
Leslie Knope,"What's the hashtag gonna be? ""Boss bitch"" or ""bitch boss""?"
Leslie Knope,"Eh, I don't hate that."
Leslie Knope,"They're right here! Well, we're not witches."
Leslie Knope,That's sexist and offensive.
Leslie Knope,"But we're right here, and we are not gonna sit in this room and let you drag our names through the mud just to score some cheap political points."
Leslie Knope,We have had enough.
Leslie Knope,"I am going back to work so I can do some good for this town, and my friend Donna is coming with me."
Leslie Knope,"Really, councilman?"
Leslie Knope,Again?
Leslie Knope,"The recall election is coming up, and Jamm keeps trying to figure out ways to screw me over."
Leslie Knope,"Last week, he tried to have me listed on the ballot as ""Leslie Buttface Hitler the Fourth."""
Leslie Knope,"All you're trying to do is disenfranchise the people from former Eagleton, people who will most likely vote for me because I saved a lot of their jobs."
Leslie Knope,I move that we table the discussion until after the election.
Leslie Knope,Thank you!
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,I just get excited when you like me.
Leslie Knope,"I put my career on the line by saving Eagleton, and he's trying to rob me of their votes?"
Leslie Knope,Those are my votes.
Leslie Knope,I've earned them!
Leslie Knope,I want them!
Leslie Knope,Give me those votes!
Leslie Knope,I can't believe Jamm tried to pull that crap.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, do I?"
Leslie Knope,"Tonight, I am throwing Ben his dream birthday party, a roller skating bash with an early '90s theme."
Leslie Knope,Ben lives for the early '90s.
Leslie Knope,"The music, the fashion."
Leslie Knope,It's his favorite era.
Leslie Knope,As for the roller skating
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Larry."
Leslie Knope,Tell us how this looks.
Leslie Knope,Ben wants to do a synchronized couple skate to Losing My Religion.
Leslie Knope,Hit it!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I thought this bill was tabled?"
Leslie Knope,"I was about to attend a roller skating birthday party for my husband, but this is more important."
Leslie Knope,Point of order!
Leslie Knope,The councilwoman wishes to speak on this issue.
Leslie Knope,"No, I will not yield."
Leslie Knope,Nor will I yield for the rest of the evening.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Gross!
Leslie Knope,"And yes, it's a filibuster."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I am not willing to let you deprive me
Leslie Knope,I remember the first time I voted.
Leslie Knope,"I was in my bedroom, and I was five."
Leslie Knope,"I voted for Mildred, my stuffed pig, but my cat, pancakes, won."
Leslie Knope,She had more funding.
Leslie Knope,"Politics, right?"
Leslie Knope,What are you gonna do?
Leslie Knope,How long have I been talking?
Leslie Knope,Three hours?
Leslie Knope,"No, eight minutes."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Everyone in Pawnee should have the right to vote.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"As I dissect this important and profound statement, I'm just gonna take these off for a second."
Leslie Knope,Is the gong really necessary?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the strike is worth it if I can take these off."
Leslie Knope,"As Ronald Reagan would say, ""Well, mommy, I believe voting rights are important."""
Leslie Knope,Does anyone else think it's hot in here?
Leslie Knope,These overalls are really starchy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, speaking of heat, we should discuss America's whitehot passion for voting rights and the men and women who help protect them, like the local city councilwoman who is starving and thinking about her husband's Reservoir Dog themed birthday cake and wanting to eat it really badly."
Leslie Knope,Democracy is not unlike a cake.
Leslie Knope,"It's layered, delicious, chocolate, and I want some."
Leslie Knope,Thank you!
Leslie Knope,You are all warriors of democracy.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it was the first mayor of Pawnee, in 1817, who said, ""All we have is the right to vote and the right to kill Indians without consequence."""
Leslie Knope,And I believe that half of that statement is still true today.
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Second wind!
Leslie Knope,"We stand on the side of Rosa Parks, and Gandhi, and Team Aniston."
Leslie Knope,One small vote for Pawnee is one giant leap of voting for mankind.
Leslie Knope,"If I save your right to vote, you're gonna vote for someone from Eagleton?"
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna yield.
Leslie Knope,I justâ¦ I need some time to think.
Leslie Knope,"And because I must keep talking, I'm gonna think out loud."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, if Eagletonians vote for someone else, then it would be in my best interest to stop, right?"
Leslie Knope,So they can't vote.
Leslie Knope,"Or I keep going, because the right to vote is fundamental in any democracy, and this is bigger than me or anyone."
Leslie Knope,I don't care if I lose.
Leslie Knope,No one prevents people in my town from voting.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,The filibuster is on!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, it's so hot."
Leslie Knope,Almost as hot as the flames that Eagleton would have gone down in if I had not saved them.
Leslie Knope,That's--
Leslie Knope,All I want is the promise of democracy.
Leslie Knope,I want that marg.
Leslie Knope,I want that Margarita.
Leslie Knope,I want to drink it.
Leslie Knope,Give me that Margarita!
Leslie Knope,No! I want votes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, in these last few minutes, I would like to talk about the voting rights act of 1968 while clenching every muscle in my body."
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Leslie Knope,"I love you, but move! I have to go to the whiz palace."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! That was epic! I was peeing so freakin' hard, it was like a jacuzzi jet or--"
Leslie Knope,Hey! Ingrid! I wasn't talking about the velocity of my pee because you are a very smart and classy lady.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you remember Ingrid de Forest from the former Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Buzz kill.
Leslie Knope,"Right, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that is the best offer you could ever make, but I had to miss my husband's birthday party for this, so I think I'll be spending the evening with him."
Leslie Knope,"A rain check, maybe."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry your birthday party got all screwed up.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should put those roller skates back on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we're not going to the party."
Leslie Knope,We're going home.
Leslie Knope,"Larry, everyone else was able to make it to the committee meeting on time."
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?
Leslie Knope,No discussion about the recall election until the polls close at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,Let's focus on what we can control.
Leslie Knope,"In 24 hours, we are going to transform City Hall into the best haunted house Pawnee has ever seen."
Leslie Knope,It's recall day.
Leslie Knope,"I've made my case, and the latest polls have it as a dead heat, so there's nothing left to do but wait."
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I got stuff to do."
Leslie Knope,I'm planning a haunted house.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, um... It's Kevin Pollack's birthday."
Leslie Knope,That's something to focus on today.
Leslie Knope,Who cares about the recall?
Leslie Knope,It's Kevin's day.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, people, the grand opening is in 20 hours."
Leslie Knope,"Larry, you had the easiest job, Two triangles and a tooth."
Leslie Knope,Nobody wants Gengurch family themed Jackolanterns.
Leslie Knope,Is any of this even good?
Leslie Knope,"Why didn't we call it ""City Halloween""?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need to change every single banner."
Leslie Knope,Fun!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're a genius!"
Leslie Knope,Your brain is almost as perfect as your face.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, great work, as always."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna stay here and just kind of wait for the results to pour in.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you all tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"No, really, it's gonna be hours before they call it."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, that's very sweet, you guys."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's hunker down."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a long night.
Leslie Knope,What did he say?
Leslie Knope,"What's up, fartwads?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've been boycotting them ever since Pinewood and her goons started this whole recall business, but who cares now, right?"
Leslie Knope,What does it matter?
Leslie Knope,Nothing matters anymore.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is good.
Leslie Knope,This is really good.
Leslie Knope,Why did I ever fight this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, concession speech?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I wrote one."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go fall asleep on a bench.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the den of horrors.
Leslie Knope,"Scary stuff is invisible, Leah. Broken dreams, disappointment, achieving your greatest goal and having it all fall apart and knowing that you'll never climb any higher."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna give you something sweeter than candy, Ryan. The truth."
Leslie Knope,It's very possible that some of you have already peaked.
Leslie Knope,"It's all downhill from here, turkeys."
Leslie Knope,It is Ms. Knope.
Leslie Knope,"It's not city councilwoman Knope, because that chapter of my life is already over."
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, kids, nothing gold can stay."
Leslie Knope,I don't feel awful.
Leslie Knope,"You know, actually, I feel like I can finally relax."
Leslie Knope,Accepting that you've peaked is very freeing.
Leslie Knope,Or do you?
Leslie Knope,"Maybe instead of working super hard to rebuild your life, you just said, ""I peaked."""
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What a great run.
Leslie Knope,And now I'm going to spend the rest of my life really chill.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,There it is.
Leslie Knope,Drink up.
Leslie Knope,Shots!
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"I had my time, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I did my thing.
Leslie Knope,"I wanted to be a city councilor, and I did, and I was, and I was like, whoo!"
Leslie Knope,"And the people were like, pffft!"
Leslie Knope,I love you so much.
Leslie Knope,This is real.
Leslie Knope,You're my husband.
Leslie Knope,You married me in front of people.
Leslie Knope,"We may have peaked, but it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"We need to do something big, you know, something that really lets people know that we're gonna love each other forever."
Leslie Knope,I got it.
Leslie Knope,"We would like to get tattoos on our bodies, 'cause we love each other."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,It happened!
Leslie Knope,Look what he's doing.
Leslie Knope,He's breaking pens.
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question?
Leslie Knope,Are we the cutest couple you've ever seen?
Leslie Knope,I have a big idea.
Leslie Knope,"I want a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, tastefully done, and then she has a very classy tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm."
Leslie Knope,And that's very subtle.
Leslie Knope,"No, scratch that."
Leslie Knope,Scratch all that.
Leslie Knope,"Just write ""Ben""."
Leslie Knope,Ann's here!
Leslie Knope,Ann wants a tattoo!
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Be ""respitable"" for a second, okay?"
Leslie Knope,What we are doing is not nuts.
Leslie Knope,We are merely getting tattoos so that everybody knows we love each other and that we haven't peaked.
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, world traveler."
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,"- What? No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,#NAME?
Leslie Knope,"Intellectually, I knew that I might be in trouble, but deep in my heart, I never really thought"
Leslie Knope,"""They held the recall election, and I lost."""
Leslie Knope,"""I was voted out of office."""
Leslie Knope,"""In 30 days, I will no longer be a Pawnee city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's so hard to read when you're drunk."
Leslie Knope,"""But I am Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am more than a city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am an unstoppable force of energy."""
Leslie Knope,"""And I will use those days to work as hard as I can."""
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you poetic and noble land mermaid, you're right once again."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,"The votes have been counted, and I have been recalled."
Leslie Knope,"I am, of course, disappointed."
Leslie Knope,"But I am still your City councilwoman for 30 more days, and I intend to spend every second I have left working for you and this great city."
Leslie Knope,Hey! There you guys are.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, I need some help with the re-zoning thing."
Leslie Knope,"Also, I think we should paint our deck, so I have some color samples for you."
Leslie Knope,"And to thank you both for being there when I needed you, I carved your faces into these Jack-o-lanterns."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, it was very hard to capture your beauty, and, Ben, you make a sexy pumpkin"
Leslie Knope,No surprise.
Leslie Knope,Love you both.
Leslie Knope,See you later.
Leslie Knope,Everybody on the field!
Leslie Knope,The NFL has a campaign to try to get kids active for 60 minutes per day.
Leslie Knope,"And so we bused in a hundred lucky, little buggers from Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,And they are gonna get a chance to play with the Colts.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Reggie!"
Leslie Knope,I told you to run a button hook.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I guess you would know.
Leslie Knope,"Check it out, Tom-- the Eagleton reservoir."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it stunning?
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that this water has fluoride in it?
Leslie Knope,"First of all, send me a link to that video."
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, now that we have access to the Eagleton reservoir and the water treatment supply, Pawnee is going to have fluoride in its water for the first time in our history, our oral history."
Leslie Knope,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,Of course I'm upset that I lost the recall election.
Leslie Knope,But I'm just gonna spend the remainder of my term cramming in as many good projects as I can.
Leslie Knope,Lame duck?
Leslie Knope,Try flame duck 'cause this duck is on fire.
Leslie Knope,"Well, look, you just got to make the most of the job that you have."
Leslie Knope,"Like, take that trash collector."
Leslie Knope,"It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but he's doing it with a smile on his face."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,He's not wearing any pants.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with him?
Leslie Knope,He's smiling at us!
Leslie Knope,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,Run!
Leslie Knope,Next on the docket is a vote to approve the Pawnee Eagleton reservoir merger.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,How am I the one that is getting booted off of this city council?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fluoride is safe, it is good for you, and almost every town in America uses it."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that is not a valid reason."
Leslie Knope,Why did we come out here?
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Fluoride in the water it's a no-brainer.
Leslie Knope,Can't you just let me have this one?
Leslie Knope,"Jamm's not going to be able to kill this reservoir merger, is he?"
Leslie Knope,"On my side, I have facts, science, and reason."
Leslie Knope,All he has is fearmongering.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, he's gonna win."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'll figure something out."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Stop right there.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride protects your teeth, and it's perfectly healthy for you."
Leslie Knope,"Well, if Jamm says that, then he is a lying idiot, and if you believe it, then so are you."
Leslie Knope,Why not?
Leslie Knope,"What are they gonna do, kick me out of office?"
Leslie Knope,Why did it take me so long to realize this?
Leslie Knope,There are no consequences to my actions anymore.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what I do, literally nothing bad can happen to me."
Leslie Knope,"I'm like a white, male U.S. senator."
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride is going into the water, moron."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, mom."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Because all it does is prevent cavities!
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,I expected more from you.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,I'm a loose cannon.
Leslie Knope,We need to fight fire with fire.
Leslie Knope,"I call a town hall meeting, I gather everyone together, I distribute the binders, but now the binders are bright yellow!"
Leslie Knope,Boom!
Leslie Knope,Too extreme?
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,What are you saying we need to sex up fluoride?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,It's a pretty sexy topic already.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm as loose as a goose.
Leslie Knope,"Do your thing, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know, councilman."
Leslie Knope,That was a little dry.
Leslie Knope,"What do you say we have some fun, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Check this.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride's boring, guys."
Leslie Knope,Boo!
Leslie Knope,Welcome to Tdazzle.
Leslie Knope,It's not a chemical.
Leslie Knope,It's an aquatic based social media oral experience.
Leslie Knope,"Our polling shows that 72% of citizens are in favor of adding Tdazzle to their water, effectively killing Councilman Jamm's so-called Clean Water Bill."
Leslie Knope,"Eat it, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,I won.
Leslie Knope,This water is filled with sugar.
Leslie Knope,There's absolutely no way we are doing this.
Leslie Knope,Did you bring those with you just to do that?
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,This won't take long.
Leslie Knope,"Simply put, it would be madness to let Sweetums take over our water supply and pump it full of sugar."
Leslie Knope,What's next cookie dough toothpaste?
Leslie Knope,Bad example.
Leslie Knope,That would be amazing.
Leslie Knope,"My point is, Sweetums is an evil, profit hungry corporation that is ruining our health."
Leslie Knope,"Ever since Sweetums opened its doors, obesity is up 100%."
Leslie Knope,It's unacceptable.
Leslie Knope,Down with that poison peddling corporate monster.
Leslie Knope,Down with Sweetums!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,I wish you could've seen it.
Leslie Knope,It felt so good.
Leslie Knope,I love loose cannoning.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love the power of no consequences."
Leslie Knope,Because you were embezzling I hope.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jessica!"
Leslie Knope,Did you do something to your hair?
Leslie Knope,"Because, sister, you look good enough to eat."
Leslie Knope,Num num num num num.
Leslie Knope,You can't punish Ben for something I did.
Leslie Knope,It's not fair.
Leslie Knope,"I love him, and I will do anything to help him get his job back."
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,"""So let's all raise a glass, full of delicious, sugary drinking water, to Sweetums-- a Pawnee Institution."""
Leslie Knope,"I have to, Ben."
Leslie Knope,We can't both be out of a job.
Leslie Knope,"What will we do-- sleep all day, take cooking classes together, sit on a couch and watch movies?"
Leslie Knope,"God, that sounds horrible."
Leslie Knope,"I know that, but--"
Leslie Knope,Are you sure?
Leslie Knope,It's not gonna make a difference.
Leslie Knope,I can't beat them.
Leslie Knope,"All I have on my side is facts and science, and people hate facts and science."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Go get Tom.
Leslie Knope,Run! Get Tom!
Leslie Knope,Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things about Sweetums and their great new product.
Leslie Knope,"But when I looked at the research, I found some pretty compelling facts about Drink-ems that made me change my tune."
Leslie Knope,Each Drink-ems is packed with 35% of your daily monopotassium phosphate requirement.
Leslie Knope,MPP is an emulsifier as well as a plus-7 PH buffer.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know what you're thinking-- what about its molar mass?"
Leslie Knope,How does 136.086 grab you?
Leslie Knope,What the--
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,I have several binders with very important data that I need to get through.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, good news."
Leslie Knope,Drink-ems is dead.
Leslie Knope,"As of tomorrow, every Pawnee resident will have H-2-flow in their drinking water."
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,"I'll double-check with Tom, but I'm, like, 95% sure."
Leslie Knope,"And you and I-- we always land on our feet, right?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Things are already looking up.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Leslie Knope,Thanks to me.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, again."
Leslie Knope,"The last time he was in between jobs, he got deep into claymation, so this should be different, hopefully."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,What is this called again?
Leslie Knope,When do you go back to work again?
Leslie Knope,Ha ha!
Leslie Knope,"What, are you trying to build a house with those bricks?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I have one the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,"The money for the Pawnee Commons, aka the greatest future park in the world, aka my personal dream project is currently in a discretionary fund."
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to move it to a lockbox, to ensure that it is used for that project."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, now I do."
Leslie Knope,"Well, tell everybody in Michigan I said hi, and tell your mom that I love the banana cake she posted on Pinterest."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, the father of your child is here."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,I'll talk to you soon.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,The phone is hung up.
Leslie Knope,You got my message about Jamm being a dinkhead?
Leslie Knope,"Fine, but his is the dinkiest."
Leslie Knope,And I would know because I'm keeping score.
Leslie Knope,"Ever since I started city council, I have gone head-to-head with Jamm 112 times."
Leslie Knope,"He has won 56 times, I have won 56 times."
Leslie Knope,I will not lose our last battle.
Leslie Knope,Will you help me?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"The way you stood up like that, I thought it was gonna go a different way."
Leslie Knope,We're not done talking about the lockbox.
Leslie Knope,This isn't over.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know we have had our differences, but this is very important to me."
Leslie Knope,And I'm not leaving until we hash this out.
Leslie Knope,"""No shoes, you lose""?"
Leslie Knope,"That means we should have shoes then, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Who's that, Michelle Wie?"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Because in that picture, she's wearing a bikini."
Leslie Knope,Fantastic.
Leslie Knope,Why don't we all hit the hay?
Leslie Knope,"We'll stay here, get a good night's sleep, and we can start negotiations tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,We stopped at the outlet mall on the way here.
Leslie Knope,"Got ourselves a sleeping bag, a giant tin of caramel corn, and an irregular skirt from DKNY."
Leslie Knope,"The hem is crooked, but it was 8 bucks."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, I am not leaving until I get that lockbox."
Leslie Knope,I think I can handle it.
Leslie Knope,Scrambled eggs eaten with chopsticks?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You know, maybe we should negotiate while we're eating."
Leslie Knope,You know what might put you in the mood to talk is a couple of brewskis and a calendar featuring some of your favorite female wrestlers.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we name part of the park the ""Jamm Zone""?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You have really immersed yourself in Asian culture.
Leslie Knope,Now I think maybe we should revisit the holding bond idea.
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait until Monday."
Leslie Knope,I need to close this deal now.
Leslie Knope,So I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Let's have a change of venue and keep negotiating while we have fun.
Leslie Knope,"If I remember correctly, you enjoy the ancient art of karaoke, yes?"
Leslie Knope,I remembered your favorite duet.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time to take this party to Rydell High.
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to hear your Travolta.
Leslie Knope,She got friendly down in the sand
Leslie Knope,"Well, she was good, you know what I mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Uh summer heat boy and girl meet but ah, oh, those summer nights"
Leslie Knope,Dubee doo dubee doo dubee dubee dubee dow
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, that was pretty fun up there."
Leslie Knope,"We have fun when we collaborate, right?"
Leslie Knope,Working together?
Leslie Knope,"Lockbox, right?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,You want to be Lex Luthor?
Leslie Knope,"Well, okay."
Leslie Knope,I can't argue with that.
Leslie Knope,So I did Zuko for you.
Leslie Knope,Now you give me the lockbox.
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait a year."
Leslie Knope,I want to get started now.
Leslie Knope,I want construction started on Monday.
Leslie Knope,It's not good enough!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I sang your stupid song, I ate your stupid fake Asian food, and by the way, you should know, you don't make sushi rolls out of tuna salad"
Leslie Knope,"I did practically everything you wanted, and you won't just give this to me today?"
Leslie Knope,Screw you!
Leslie Knope,You're giving a card to me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,This is about Ann.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Commons is why I met Ann five years ago.
Leslie Knope,And I know you guys are talking about moving.
Leslie Knope,"But I guess I thought if maybe Ann came back from Michigan tomorrow, and I was able to look into her smoky, ethnically ambiguous eyes and tell her that we were breaking ground on a new park, she might... she might want to stay."
Leslie Knope,Ann arbor sounds disgusting.
Leslie Knope,What is great about it?
Leslie Knope,There's no JJ's Diner there.
Leslie Knope,"There's no ""Welcome to Pawnee"" sign."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the stupid state is split up into two pieces!"
Leslie Knope,It's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"There is no Gambit here, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"And who sides with Lex Luthor, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,You probably watch Million Dollar Baby and root for the stool.
Leslie Knope,I am leaving now.
Leslie Knope,I am not moving.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going home.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it would be even faster if the governor would return my calls about my Pawnee to Ann arbor bullet train idea."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think I burned that bridge with Jamm."
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna get that lockbox.
Leslie Knope,And I am not singing Beauty School Dropout.
Leslie Knope,"It's sexist, and I don't do slow jams."
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And to tell you the truth, I'm doing it all for my best friend."
Leslie Knope,"Well, vote passed."
Leslie Knope,3-2.
Leslie Knope,Jamm is gonna be so pissed when he finds out that you're leaving and your I.O.U.s are worthless.
Leslie Knope,Are you sure you're okay with what you did?
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm currently in deep denial that that's happening."
Leslie Knope,Is this for realskis?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is the Pawnee City Council Chambers."
Leslie Knope,Your new home away from home.
Leslie Knope,Today is my last day as City-- Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Let me try this again.
Leslie Knope,"Today is my last day asâ¦ Today is my last-- Today is my last day... You know what, you get the idea."
Leslie Knope,"My old friend Ingrid De Forest won the recall vote, and she's taking my place on Monday morning."
Leslie Knope,"But you know, luckily for me, I've processed all my feelings, and I've gone through the five stages of grief: denial, anger, Internet commenting, cat adoption, African dance, cat returning to the adoption place, watching all the episodes of Murphy Brown and not giving a flying fart."
Leslie Knope,How many stages is that?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,The point is I'm fine now.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What is your life?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I appreciate the sentiment."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Was I singing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road out loud?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ingrid is settled into my office, and this box contains the last of my stuff."
Leslie Knope,Although I might have left some salt packets in my desk.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should go back for those?
Leslie Knope,But not the kind that snaps in half maybe.
Leslie Knope,How does he find the time?
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Leslie Knope,He's reading this.
Leslie Knope,He wrote this down.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Not after someone beats him in the next election.
Leslie Knope,Someone who is smart and hardworking and who knows the job because she's done it already and is also blonde and named Leslie and loves you!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to run again.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to beat Dexhart!
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,I challenge you to find one flaw in my plan.
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, but we can go and rent a second apartment, and we can spend 51% of our time there, and then I'll file the campaign form from that address."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's not that bad."
Leslie Knope,So what?
Leslie Knope,"I've got plenty of dirt on that scumbag, I say bring it on."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm going to start my negative PR blitz against Dexhart and"
Leslie Knope,Anything is worth me getting back on City Council.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's just because people found out he was Miley Cyrus' cousin."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Shauna, no."
Leslie Knope,"Well, they couldn't make a banner in time for my press conference, so I am cobbling together a banner from all the other discarded banners."
Leslie Knope,Rat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the closest thing I could get to a rat."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you aren't supporting me on this.
Leslie Knope,Dexhart has a sex scandal the same day I'm leaving office?
Leslie Knope,"That is not a coincidence, this was meant to be."
Leslie Knope,Now you're talking!
Leslie Knope,"Good, you guys are here."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, gather around."
Leslie Knope,I have a big announcement.
Leslie Knope,I am officially seeking reelection to the Pawnee City Council.
Leslie Knope,"I am going to be running for Dexhart's seat, and the campaign starts now!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I love the sound of silence before a big cheer."
Leslie Knope,"That's what's happening, right?"
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you have always given me sage counsel, and your words carry great influence."
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you think I should do?"
Leslie Knope,"What the hell do you know, dumdum?"
Leslie Knope,"All of you, look, this is my only option."
Leslie Knope,I am running again with or without you.
Leslie Knope,"""And therefore, with your help, we can make our future bright."
Leslie Knope,"""I believe I still have a lot to offer this city."""
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I stormed out.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jen."
Leslie Knope,What brings you back to Pawnee?
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh, I guess."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, how are you? How's your family?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, that does sound fascinating,"
Leslie Knope,but you're right.
Leslie Knope,So they recall me after all I've done for them!
Leslie Knope,But Dexhart now has another sex scandal.
Leslie Knope,"And the plan is I'm going to run for his seat because how do I lose to a guy like that? That's a great idea, right?"
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?"
Leslie Knope,Because it's my dream job.
Leslie Knope,Is that what you did?
Leslie Knope,I just need
Leslie Knope,"I have gathered you all here today because I have an announcement, a very big announcement about my future."
Leslie Knope,"I will be heading to lunch today, with my husband, at JJ's Diner."
Leslie Knope,We will eat waffles and then we will go home and make out on our couch.
Leslie Knope,"That is my future, for now."
Leslie Knope,"It's been an honor to serve this town, and I will cherish the memories forever."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Jen Barkley telling me I had a future was the best present I could've gotten.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you are the sweetest man in the world."
Leslie Knope,Where is it?
Leslie Knope,"In times of stress, or moments of transition, sometimes it can feel like the whole world is closing in on you."
Leslie Knope,"When that happens, you should close your eyes, take a deep breath, listen to the people who love you when they give you advice, and remember what really matters."
Leslie Knope,"And if you have the ability to go to Paris, by all means, go to Paris."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
